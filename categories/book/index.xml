&lt;p&gt;A British science fiction television series that aired from 1970 to 1971, focusing on Earth&amp;rsquo;s defense against an alien invasion in the then-future of 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise &lt;a href=&#34;#premise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Earth is under threat from aliens from a dying planet who are abducting humans for their organs. SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation), a secret international military agency operating under the guise of a movie studio, is formed to defend Earth. SHADO utilizes advanced technology, including a space intruder detection satellite (SID), lunar interceptors, a submarine/aircraft called Skydiver, and ground-based SHADO Mobiles. The aliens are humanoid, requiring a green oxygenated liquid and special contact lenses. Their UFOs can travel faster than light but have limited time in Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series features a large ensemble cast with frequent changes. Ed Bishop as Commander Ed Straker is the only actor to appear in every episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 26 episodes were broadcast in a non-chronological order by ITV. The list provides the original ATV (Midlands) broadcast order, along with director, writer, original air date, and production code. Episode titles include &amp;ldquo;Identified,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Exposed,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Cat with Ten Lives,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Conflict,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;A Question of Priorities,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Long Sleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lew Grade approached Gerry Anderson to create a live-action TV series, resulting in &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt;. The series was influenced by UFO sightings and Christiaan Barnard&amp;rsquo;s transplant operations. Sylvia Anderson designed the costumes, including the purple wigs for female Moonbase staff. The Harlington-Straker Studio was the actual studio where the series was filmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filming began in April 1969 at MGM-British Studios, then moved to Pinewood Studios in June 1970. George Sewell and Gabrielle Drake left after the studio change. Harry Baird and Peter Gordeno also left the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;costumes&#34;&gt;Costumes &lt;a href=&#34;#costumes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female Moonbase personnel wore purple wigs, silver catsuits, and heavy eye makeup for a futuristic look. Ed Bishop initially bleached his hair, then wore a white wig. Other male characters also wore wigs. Only two alien suits were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;special-effects&#34;&gt;Special effects &lt;a href=&#34;#special-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Meddings supervised the special effects, using techniques like double-walled visors and underwater effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vehicle-design&#34;&gt;Vehicle design &lt;a href=&#34;#vehicle-design&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Meddings and Mike Trim designed the vehicles. The gull-winged cars were originally built for &lt;em&gt;Doppelgänger&lt;/em&gt;. The blue SHADO Jeeps were built on Mini Moke chassis. Few original props and miniatures have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast&#34;&gt;Broadcast &lt;a href=&#34;#broadcast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters were unsure if &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; was for adults or children. In the UK, episodes were shown in the late afternoon and Saturday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews of &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; are mixed. Some praise the visuals, music, and costumes, while others criticize the writing and pacing. Some reviews note the series&amp;rsquo; mix of adult themes and science fiction elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aborted-second-series&#34;&gt;Aborted second series &lt;a href=&#34;#aborted-second-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITC commissioned a second series, &lt;em&gt;UFO 2&lt;/em&gt;, set entirely on the Moon. However, when ratings dropped, ITC cancelled the plans. Gerry Anderson then created &lt;em&gt;Space: 1999&lt;/em&gt; from the pre-production work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;merchandise&#34;&gt;Merchandise &lt;a href=&#34;#merchandise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series generated a range of toys, including Dinky die-cast vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;compilation-films&#34;&gt;Compilation films &lt;a href=&#34;#compilation-films&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several episodes were compiled into films, including &lt;em&gt;Invasion: UFO&lt;/em&gt;. Italian producers also created compilation films with mixed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel 5 and ITC released VHS collections. The complete series was released on DVD in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;proposed-feature-film&#34;&gt;Proposed feature film &lt;a href=&#34;#proposed-feature-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a feature film adaptation was announced, but it did not enter production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories set in the &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; universe have appeared in novels, comics, and video games. Julian Gollop cited &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; as an influence for &lt;em&gt;UFO: Enemy Unknown&lt;/em&gt;. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto drew inspiration from &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; for character designs in &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article provides a comprehensive list of fictional creatures and aliens from the Doctor Who universe, a long-running BBC science fiction television series. It notes the show&amp;rsquo;s initial run from 1963 to 1989, its revival in 2005, and the central character, the Doctor, an extraterrestrial who travels through time and space in the TARDIS. The list excludes specific characters and focuses on alien races and fictional creatures, including those appearing in spin-off series like &lt;em&gt;The Sarah Jane Adventures&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Class&lt;/em&gt;, but excludes antagonists original to those series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abzorbaloff&#34;&gt;Abzorbaloff &lt;a href=&#34;#abzorbaloff&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abzorbaloff is an alien creature from the planet Clom, known for absorbing living beings into its body through touch. It appeared in the episode &amp;ldquo;Love &amp;amp; Monsters&amp;rdquo; (2006). In this episode, an Abzorbalovian disguised as &amp;ldquo;Victor Kennedy&amp;rdquo; infiltrated a group called L.I.N.D.A. to gain knowledge from the Doctor. The Abzorbaloff was ultimately defeated when Elton Pope broke its cane, causing the Earth to absorb it. The creature was created by William Grantham, a nine-year-old who won a &lt;em&gt;Blue Peter&lt;/em&gt; contest. Comedian Peter Kay portrayed the Abzorbaloff on-screen. A short sequel, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The Genuine Article&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; features the Abzorbaloff&amp;rsquo;s father seeking revenge, directed and animated by Grantham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adipose&#34;&gt;Adipose &lt;a href=&#34;#adipose&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode &amp;ldquo;Partners in Crime&amp;rdquo; (2008). Originating from the lost breeding world Adipose 3, they rely on a drug formulated by &amp;ldquo;Miss Foster&amp;rdquo; to convert human fat into Adipose children through parthenogenesis. This process, if accelerated, can be fatal to the host. The Adipose abandoned Foster to hide their illegal activities. In an alternate timeline in &amp;ldquo;Turn Left&amp;rdquo; (2008), the Adipose incident in America resulted in over 60 million deaths. The Adipose were inspired by a plush toy owned by writer Russell T Davies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aggedor&#34;&gt;Aggedor &lt;a href=&#34;#aggedor&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggedor is the Sacred Royal Beast of the planet Peladon, first appearing in &lt;em&gt;The Curse of Peladon&lt;/em&gt; (1972). The creature is a large, hairy beast with a single horn, hunted to near extinction. In the story, Peladon&amp;rsquo;s High Priest, Hepesh, used a captured Aggedor to generate superstition and prevent Peladon from joining the Galactic Federation. Actor Nick Hobbs portrayed Aggedor in both &lt;em&gt;The Curse of Peladon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Monster of Peladon&lt;/em&gt; (1974). The audio story &lt;em&gt;The Bride of Peladon&lt;/em&gt; reveals Aggedor had a child, which later gave birth to many baby Aggedors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;axons&#34;&gt;Axons &lt;a href=&#34;#axons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Axons are golden-skinned humanoids who attempt to take over Earth by distributing Axonite, pieces of the single creature Axos, in &lt;em&gt;The Claws of Axos&lt;/em&gt; (1971). They pose as a friendly family but can shapeshift into monstrous forms. The Axons are later trapped in a time loop alongside Axos. Actors Bernard Holley, Patricia Gordino, John Hicks, and Debbie Lee London portrayed the Axons. The Axons reappeared in the 2010 comic strip &amp;ldquo;The Golden Ones,&amp;rdquo; where they attempted to free Axos and rampage across Tokyo until defeated by the Eleventh Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boneless are creatures from a two-dimensional universe, seen in &amp;ldquo;Flatline&amp;rdquo; (2014). They harness energy from the TARDIS to infiltrate the Doctor&amp;rsquo;s universe. Clara Oswald and Rigsy trick the Boneless into restoring the TARDIS, allowing the Doctor to send them back to their home dimension. The Boneless later appeared in the comic story &lt;em&gt;The Fourth Wall&lt;/em&gt;, where they use comic books to trap readers until the Twelfth Doctor defeats them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;c&#34;&gt;C &lt;a href=&#34;#c&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Carrionites are creatures from &amp;ldquo;The Dark Times,&amp;rdquo; who fought against the Time Lords. They appear in &amp;ldquo;The Shakespeare Code&amp;rdquo; (2007). Three Carrionites, Bloodtide, Doomfinger, and Lilith, attempt to release their species from a prison using the power of words and witchcraft, manipulating William Shakespeare. The Tenth Doctor and Shakespeare reverse the process, trapping the Carrionites back into their prison. They reappeared in the audio drama &lt;em&gt;The Carrionite Curse&lt;/em&gt;, facing the Sixth Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;catkind&#34;&gt;Catkind &lt;a href=&#34;#catkind&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Catkind are felines evolved into humanoids, first seen in &amp;ldquo;New Earth&amp;rdquo; (2006). They have hair-covered bodies, feline facial features, and retractable claws. In &amp;ldquo;New Earth,&amp;rdquo; the Sisters of Plenitude, a group of Catkind, run a hospital where they test on human subjects. The Tenth Doctor develops a cure, and the Sisters are arrested. In &amp;ldquo;Gridlock&amp;rdquo; (2007), a Cat Person, Thomas Kincade Brannigan, has a human wife and kittens. Novice Hame, a surviving Sister of Plentitude, aids the Tenth Doctor. Actress Anna Hope portrayed Hame. A short scene, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The Secret of Novice Hame&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; depicts Hame on her deathbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chameleons&#34;&gt;Chameleons &lt;a href=&#34;#chameleons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chameleons are aliens with no features who can take on the appearance of individual humans, seen in &lt;em&gt;The Faceless Ones&lt;/em&gt; (1967). They lost their identities in an explosion and kidnap humans to adopt their identities. The Second Doctor convinces them to seek another solution. The Chameleons later re-appeared in the spin-off book &lt;em&gt;Short Trips and Side Steps&lt;/em&gt;, where they infiltrate the planet Krennos until the Sixth Doctor stops them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cheetah-people&#34;&gt;Cheetah People &lt;a href=&#34;#cheetah-people&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheetah People are feline humanoids resembling cheetahs who enjoy hunting humans, encountered in &lt;em&gt;Survival&lt;/em&gt; (1989). They were once humanoids who mutated after bonding with cat-like creatures known as Kitlings. The Master, stranded on their planet, attempts to use them to escape. The Seventh Doctor stops the Master, leaving him stranded. Writer Rona Munro was disappointed with the final version of the Cheetah People.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chronovores&#34;&gt;Chronovores &lt;a href=&#34;#chronovores&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronovores are glowing white creatures that live outside time, one of whom, Kronos, is encountered in &lt;em&gt;The Time Monster&lt;/em&gt; (1972). The Master attempts to use Kronos, but the Third Doctor thwarts his plans. The Chronovores re-appeared in the book &lt;em&gt;The Quantum Archangel&lt;/em&gt;, where Kronos sought revenge against the Master and sacrificed itself to stop the Chronovores from feeding on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chuldur&#34;&gt;Chuldur &lt;a href=&#34;#chuldur&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chuldur are a race of shape shifting bird-like aliens who appeared in the Fifteenth Doctor story &amp;ldquo;Rogue&amp;rdquo; (2024). The Chuldur appeared in 1813, where they infiltrated a ball in order to &amp;ldquo;cosplay&amp;rdquo; as those from the nineteenth century. The Fifteenth Doctor is able to trap the Chuldur within a sealing device, which banished them to another dimension, but at the sacrifice of Rogue, a bounty hunter the Doctor had fallen in love with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cryons&#34;&gt;Cryons &lt;a href=&#34;#cryons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryons are an all-female species of alien first seen in &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Cybermen&lt;/em&gt; (1985). They cannot exist at temperatures above zero degrees. The Cryons lived on Telos until the Cybermen took control, and allied with the mercenary Lytton to defeat them. The Cryons were later destroyed by an attack by the Cybermen. Director Matthew Robinson elected to make the Cryons an all-female race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cyberman&#34;&gt;Cyberman &lt;a href=&#34;#cyberman&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cybermen are humanoids originating on Earth&amp;rsquo;s twin planet Mondas, first seen in &lt;em&gt;The Tenth Planet&lt;/em&gt; (1966). They replace organic body parts with artificial ones, becoming coldly logical. The Cyberman concept was created by Dr. Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis in 1966. The Cybermen were portrayed by tall actors. In the two-part story &amp;ldquo;Rise of the Cybermen&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Age of Steel&amp;rdquo; (2006), the Cybermen originate on a parallel-universe version of Earth, created by John Lumic. The Cybermen have several variants, such as the Cybermat and the Cybershades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article discusses various conspiracy theories surrounding Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), particularly the idea that governments, especially the United States government, are suppressing evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology. It also explores the evolution of these theories, their proponents, and their presence in popular culture and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the core concept of UFO conspiracy theories: governments concealing evidence of extraterrestrial involvement. It traces the origins of these theories back to pulp science fiction and the &amp;ldquo;lost continent&amp;rdquo; myths. The section highlights Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting as a catalyst for widespread UFO reports and the subsequent speculation about secret technologies. Donald Keyhoe is identified as a key figure in popularizing the idea of a government cover-up. The emergence of the &amp;ldquo;Men in Black&amp;rdquo; concept is also mentioned. The section further explains how UFO conspiracy theories became more prevalent after the Kennedy assassination, linking his death to aliens. The term &amp;ldquo;Cosmic Watergate&amp;rdquo; is introduced to describe the alleged cover-up. The section also mentions the influence of films like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and the introduction of the Roswell incident to a mass audience. The shift from benevolent &amp;ldquo;space brothers&amp;rdquo; to malevolent aliens in the 1980s is discussed, along with the connection of UFO cover-ups to alien abductions, cattle mutilations, and the JFK assassination. The section concludes by noting the resurgence of interest in UFO conspiracy theories in the 1990s and 2017 with Leslie Kean&amp;rsquo;s stories of a Pentagon UFO program.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who claim to have been abducted are called &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; Most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject claims that alien abduction literally occurs as reported. Some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that most abductees are sane and common people, with psychopathology associated only with some cases. Mack noted the detailed nature of some abduction reports and the existence of a subculture with support groups and a mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, etc.). Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the term &amp;ldquo;alien abduction&amp;rdquo; gained widespread attention, some older stories were speculated to be possible cases, dubbed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1896, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them in Stockton, California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1953, an article in &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; questioned whether humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1955, Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported the mysterious disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, with speculation that they were victims of abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 generated widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident was the first in which the claimants described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s and suggested a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became interested in abduction reports in the 1970s and used hypnosis to extract more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980s brought mainstream attention to the subject through works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs, and psychiatrist John E. Mack. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard published a comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees. Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected and that aliens were attempting to create human-alien hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Skeptic Michael Shermer noted that the ubiquity of camera phones increases the burden of evidence for such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; called him &amp;ldquo;a well-meaning man uncritically elaborating on tales of alien abduction, and potentially both cementing and constructing false memories&amp;rdquo;. Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression of claimants helped spread the Grey aliens meme into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. Due to Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief and subsequent promotion of the claims of those he interviewed, his professional reputation suffered, prompting Harvard to review his position in 1994. He retained tenure, but &amp;ldquo;was not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population allege to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although abduction reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental Health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &amp;ldquo;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&amp;rdquo;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking&amp;rdquo;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &amp;ldquo;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism&amp;rdquo;. UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters but also featured demonization of FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering it important to warn the world of such imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS&amp;rsquo;s definition of &lt;em&gt;abductee&lt;/em&gt;, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; through means like hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although different cases vary in detail, some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp;amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time&lt;/strong&gt;. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany&lt;/strong&gt;. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience&amp;rdquo;, accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says: &amp;ldquo;The entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness &amp;ldquo;the Oz Factor&amp;rdquo;. External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings about environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that many abductees are sane individuals, with psychopathology only present in some cases. Detailed abduction reports have led to the development of a subculture with support groups and a complex mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types, such as Greys, Reptilians, and Nordics. Some abductees engage in independent research and attribute the lack of wider awareness to extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. One example is Colonel H. G. Shaw&amp;rsquo;s 1896 claim of being harassed by tall, slender humanoids. An article from 1953 asked if flying saucers were kidnapping humans for zoological specimens or vivisection. The 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil during the mid-1950s was an early claim but received limited attention initially. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the phenomenon in the 1960s and linked abductions to cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became a key figure in the abductee subculture in the 1970s, using hypnosis to uncover details of remembered events. The 1980s saw increased mainstream attention, with works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack presenting alien abduction as a plausible experience. Thomas E. Bullard&amp;rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than previously thought, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been abducted. They also proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of widespread interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, alien abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer suggests that the ubiquity of camera phones has increased the burden of evidence, contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;

External sounds cease to have any significance, and they report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts, lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, often through solid objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge of the operation is often taller than the others and may appear to be of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. The abductors&amp;rsquo; areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems given less attention include the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx, and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the &amp;ldquo;examination.&amp;rdquo; Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives, although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subsequent-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; is an American science fiction media franchise created by Rockne S. O&amp;rsquo;Bannon, known for &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt;. The franchise, owned by 20th Century Studios, encompasses film, television, novels, and comics centered around alien refugees living on Earth. It blends science fiction with elements of drama, police procedural, and buddy cop genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting&#34;&gt;Setting &lt;a href=&#34;#setting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise is set in the near future in the United States, specifically starting in 1991. A flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert, revealing the Tenctonese, an extraterrestrial race referred to as &amp;ldquo;Newcomers.&amp;rdquo; These aliens are escaping slavery from a cruel Overseer race. The Tenctonese resemble humans but possess anatomical differences and enhanced physical and intellectual capabilities due to selective breeding. The core concept revolves around the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration into American society, exploring themes of multiculturalism and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;film&#34;&gt;Film &lt;a href=&#34;#film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise began with the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;, released by 20th Century Fox. The film depicts the integration of the Tenctonese refugees, or Newcomers, into human society in Los Angeles. It combines science fiction and police drama elements. The film stars Mandy Patinkin as Sam &amp;ldquo;George&amp;rdquo; Francisco, a Newcomer detective in the Los Angeles Police Department, and James Caan as Matthew Sykes, his initially reluctant human partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television&#34;&gt;Television &lt;a href=&#34;#television&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Fox adapted the film into a television series, also called &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The series follows the same premise as the film, focusing on the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration after their ship crashes on Earth. Eric Pierpoint stars as George Francisco, and Gary Graham as Matthew Sikes. The series explores themes of racism and the treatment of minority ethnic groups. The series ran for one season of 21 episodes and a pilot episode, ending in 1990. Fox abruptly cancelled the series after the season. Beginning in 1994, the network continued the story in five TV movies, which brought back the entire cast. The installments include &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; (1994), &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt; (1995), &lt;em&gt;Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996), &lt;em&gt;The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; (1996), and &lt;em&gt;The Udara Legacy&lt;/em&gt; (1997).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pocket Books, a division of Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, published a novel series connected to the franchise starting in 1993. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, known for their work in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, wrote a novel entitled &lt;em&gt;Day of Descent&lt;/em&gt;. Some novels served as prequels to the movie sequels, such as K.W. Jeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Cross of Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a tie-in to the &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; film, and Peter David&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt;, which became one of the sequels of the same name. The novels regularly addressed racism and discrimination with extraterrestrial themes. K. W. Jeter and Barry B. Longyear were regular contributors to the series with novels like, &lt;em&gt;The Change&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slag Like Me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comics&#34;&gt;Comics &lt;a href=&#34;#comics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 1992, Malibu Comics published several comics adapting the &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; storyline. Among the first released titles were &lt;em&gt;The Spartans&lt;/em&gt;, created with the help of author Bill Spangler and illustrator James Tucker, and &lt;em&gt;A Breed Apart&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Steve Jones. Other titles included &lt;em&gt;Public Enemy&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Sandy Carruthers and illustrated by Lowell Cunningham, and a crossover series with the &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; franchise titled &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt; series included four different adventures called &lt;em&gt;Plans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pasts&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pawns&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pains&lt;/em&gt; along with a collector&amp;rsquo;s edition. Other contributors to the series included illustrators Terry Pallott and Leonard Kirk to titles like, &lt;em&gt;The Skin Trade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;remake&#34;&gt;Remake &lt;a href=&#34;#remake&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 25, 2015, Fox announced a remake with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing. On September 9, 2016, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported that Jeff Nichols would write and direct the film. On January 25, 2021, it was announced that Jeff Nichols would remake the film as a ten-part television series. On June 21, 2024, it was reported Nichols was developing an original sci-fi feature film for Paramount instead of an Alien Nation project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO religions are groups that incorporate beliefs about communication with extraterrestrial beings into their religious doctrines. These groups often interpret major religions as being based on supernatural beings from heaven. Communication methods include telepathy and astral projection. A common belief is that humanity can be saved through education provided by aliens, leading to societal improvement. Alien abduction experiences can also contribute to the formation of these religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for understanding UFO religions. It highlights that these religions generally involve belief in communication with extraterrestrial beings, often through physical contact, telepathy, or astral projection. These groups typically believe that aliens will save humanity by teaching them a better way to live, sometimes by taking believers to a more positive location. UFO religions emphasize spiritual growth and the evolution of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Gordon Melton is identified as considering the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; Activity, founded by Guy Ballard, as the first UFO religion. However, Christopher Hugh Partridge views it as a theosophical religion rather than a UFO religion. Partridge emphasizes the belief within UFO religions that supreme beings originate from other planets or planes, not from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident of 1947 is identified as a key event in the history of UFO spirituality, marking the emergence of UFOs into public consciousness. UFO religion is placed within the context of theosophical esotericism and New Age thought, with many groups believing that extraterrestrial beings are heralds of a new era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, is described as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults. Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate and the Order of the Solar Temple are mentioned as controversial groups combining UFO beliefs with contactee assertions. Scientology is also discussed as a UFO religion due to its Xenu cosmogony and space opera elements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_d2406df786af/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;contact-1997-film&#34;&gt;Contact (1997 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#contact-1997-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a 1997 American science fiction drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 novel of the same name. The film stars Jodie Foster as Dr. Eleanor Arroway, a SETI scientist who discovers evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ellie Arroway, driven by the childhood loss of her father and inspired by his encouragement of her amateur radio hobby, dedicates her life to SETI research at the Arecibo Observatory. Facing funding cuts led by President&amp;rsquo;s science advisor David Drumlin, she secures private funding from the reclusive billionaire S.R. Hadden to continue her work at the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years later, Arroway discovers a signal from the star Vega containing a sequence of prime numbers. The discovery leads to a global effort to decode the message, which is complicated by Drumlin and the National Security Council&amp;rsquo;s attempts to control the facility. The signal is found to contain a video of Adolf Hitler&amp;rsquo;s opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics, the first Earth transmission strong enough to reach Vega.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroway&amp;rsquo;s team decodes the signal, revealing schematics for a complex machine designed to transport a single person. Multiple nations collaborate to fund the machine&amp;rsquo;s construction at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. An international panel is formed to select a candidate for the journey. Arroway is a leading contender, but her atheism, highlighted by panel member Palmer Joss, jeopardizes her selection. Drumlin is chosen, but a religious terrorist destroys the machine during testing, killing Drumlin and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadden, now terminally ill and living on the Mir space station, informs Arroway of a second, secretly constructed machine in Hokkaido, Japan. Arroway is selected to use it. Equipped with recording devices, she enters the pod and travels through wormholes, observing alien structures and a celestial event. She finds herself on a beach resembling a childhood drawing of Pensacola, Florida, and encounters an alien taking the form of her deceased father, who explains that the aliens have been monitoring humanity&amp;rsquo;s radio emissions and have deemed them ready for first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroway awakens in the pod, which has only fallen a short distance into a safety net. Mission control insists that the experiment achieved nothing, and her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee, led by Michael Kitz, investigates the possibility of a hoax orchestrated by Hadden, who has since died. Arroway asks the committee to accept her testimony on faith, emphasizing the profound impact of her experience. Kitz and Rachel Constantine, a White House official, acknowledge that Arroway&amp;rsquo;s device recorded 18 hours of static. Arroway receives continued funding for SETI research at the VLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film features a cast of notable actors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jodie Foster as Dr. Eleanor &amp;ldquo;Ellie&amp;rdquo; Ann Arroway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jena Malone as young Ellie&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan conceived &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; in 1979 with Lynda Obst and Peter Guber at Casablanca FilmWorks. Sagan and Ann Druyan completed the film treatment in 1980, aiming to depict a realistic first contact scenario. Kip Thorne consulted on wormhole travel. The character of Ellie Arroway was not directly inspired by Jill Tarter, though Foster met her for research. The name Ellie was inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project faced numerous rewrites and stalled development. Sagan rewrote &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; as a novel, published in 1985. Roland Joffé and George Miller were initially attached to direct but later departed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Zemeckis took over as director, securing artistic control. Filming began in September 1996 and concluded in February 1997. Key locations included the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, Warner Hollywood Studios, and Culver Studios. CNN news personalities were scripted into the film to enhance realism. Second unit filming took place at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Fiji, Saint John, US Virgin Islands, and Newfoundland, Canada. Technical consultants from the SETI Institute, Caltech, and a former White House staff member were involved. Sagan participated in the production until his death in December 1996, and the film is dedicated to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-effects&#34;&gt;Visual effects &lt;a href=&#34;#visual-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight VFX companies, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Weta Digital, and Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic, collaborated on the visual effects. Weta Digital designed the wormhole sequence. Digital alterations were made to news footage of Bill Clinton. Digital color correction addressed continuity issues during location shooting. The opening scene is a five-minute CGI sequence depicting a zoom out from Earth to the distant universe. The mirror shot was created through three different plates and manipulated in CGI. The machine was designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a design he created as a &amp;ldquo;time-displacement device&amp;rdquo; for an unused scene in &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Silvestri composed and conducted the original score. A soundtrack album was released in August 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores the cultural conflicts between religion and science, particularly concerning the existence of God. The film presents various viewpoints on faith and scientific evidence. It depicts intense public debate about the implications of alien contact, including questions about morality and the role of science. The film raises questions about the authenticity of Arroway&amp;rsquo;s journey, leaving room for doubt. The film suggests that science and religion can coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s release in July 1997 boosted interest in Sagan&amp;rsquo;s novel. The book appeared on &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best Seller list. The film premiered on July 1, 1997, and was released in the United States and Canada on July 11, 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film received generally positive reviews. Critics praised its exploration of scientific and theological concepts but noted weaknesses in storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;awards&#34;&gt;Awards &lt;a href=&#34;#awards&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and two Saturn Awards. It received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Sound and a Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Jodie Foster).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and large, black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoids with grey skin, elongated bodies, small chests, and a lack of muscular definition. They are said to lack external human body parts like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their most striking feature is their disproportionately large heads with no hair and large, opaque, black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection further elaborates on the physical appearance of Grey aliens. They are generally depicted as lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from humans. The most prominent feature is their large, black, almond-shaped eyes, often described as lacking eye whites. They are also frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains the origin of the connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system. The association began with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and determined that the aliens&amp;rsquo; home was Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype. It notes that descriptions of beings similar to Greys predate alien encounter claims, citing H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; descriptions of future humans in &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; (1893) and the Eloi in &amp;ldquo;The Time Machine&amp;rdquo; (1895).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the literary and occult origins of the Grey alien concept. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; depictions of future humans and the Eloi are mentioned as early examples of beings with Grey-like characteristics. Aleister Crowley&amp;rsquo;s 1917 encounter with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, described as similar to a modern Grey, is also discussed. Gustav Sandgren&amp;rsquo;s 1933 science fiction novel, &lt;em&gt;Den okända faran&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;), which describes a race of extraterrestrials with grey skin, bald heads, and large eyes, is identified as a key influence on the modern image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case and its role in popularizing the Grey alien archetype. The Hills claimed that in 1961, they were abducted by grayish-skinned humanoid beings and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s 1990 article suggests that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which featured an alien with large eyes. Carl Sagan echoed these suspicions, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses how Grey aliens became an integral part of ufology and extraterrestrial-related folklore after the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter. Journalist C.D.B. Bryan notes that 73% of reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. The section also mentions the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, and claims that individuals saw the U.S. military handling child-sized beings with oversized heads and slanted eyes. Whitley Strieber&amp;rsquo;s 1987 book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, which described his alleged encounters with Greys, is also discussed. Jimmy Guieu&amp;rsquo;s 1988 interview on TF1&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ciel, mon mardi!&lt;/em&gt; introduced the term &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; to the French public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section further notes that Greys have become the subject of many conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of a government disinformation campaign or a product of mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s 1995 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to depict the autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection analyzes the role of Greys in alien abduction claims. It notes that Greys make up a significant percentage of reported alien encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focus of abduction claims, with abductees reporting that the Greys stare into their eyes during mental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents neurologist Steven Novella&amp;rsquo;s theory that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with their distinctive features representing traits associated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses Frederick V. Malmstrom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis,&amp;rdquo; which suggests that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom argues that the face of a Grey can be reconstructed through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face based on early-childhood sensation and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s argument that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection briefly mentions alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of alleged Grey aliens, including the interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the depiction of Grey aliens in popular culture. It notes that Greys have become a common way to depict extraterrestrials in fiction, supplanting the &amp;ldquo;little green men&amp;rdquo; archetype. Examples include Ultraman (1966), &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;. The section also mentions the increasing association of Greys with conspiracy theories in the 1990s, citing &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; as a prominent example. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The films &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; (2011) and &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; (2013) are also mentioned, as well as the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; (2021) and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt; (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulians, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin, lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition, and having disproportionately short legs. A key feature is their large heads relative to their bodies, devoid of hair, with small orifices for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their eyes are large, opaque, black, and almond-shaped. They are often described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system stems from Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and identified the stars as Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of beings resembling Grey aliens predate reported encounters. H.G. Wells described future humans with similar features in his 1893 article &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; and his 1895 novel &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. In 1917, Aleister Crowley described an entity named Lam with a similar appearance. In 1933, Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, described aliens with grey clothes, bald heads, and large eyes in his science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 brought the Grey alien archetype to public attention in 1965. The Hills claimed they were abducted by grey-skinned humanoids and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which aired shortly before Barney&amp;rsquo;s first hypnotic session. Carl Sagan also suggested &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as a potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter, Greys became a central figure in ufology and extraterrestrial folklore, particularly in the United States, where they account for 73% of reported alien encounters. The alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, was later linked to Greys. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, a book detailing his alleged encounters with Greys, which became a bestseller and was adapted into a film. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu introduced the term &amp;ldquo;les Petits-Gris&amp;rdquo; (little greys) to French audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys have become the subject of conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of government disinformation campaigns or mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage of an autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from Roswell, but later admitted it was a &amp;ldquo;reconstruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greys are frequently associated with alien abduction claims, accounting for a significant percentage of reported encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focal point, with claims of inducing hallucinogenic states or emotions through staring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the presence of Grey aliens in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens have become a common depiction of extraterrestrials in fiction, replacing the earlier &amp;ldquo;little green men.&amp;rdquo; They have appeared in films and television shows such as &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;. During the 1990s, plotlines linking Greys to conspiracy theories became prevalent, as seen in &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The film &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; features a Grey alien who attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; presence in pop culture to government manipulation. The film &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; features child abduction by Greys. Greys also appear in the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;interdimensional-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Interdimensional UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#interdimensional-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interdimensional UFO hypothesis (IUH) proposes that unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings result from encounters with other &amp;ldquo;dimensions&amp;rdquo; that coexist alongside our own. This idea is supported by ufologists who suggest that UFOs are a modern manifestation of phenomena throughout human history, previously attributed to mythological or supernatural beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context of the interdimensional UFO hypothesis, tracing its roots from pre-modern concepts to modern ufology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-modern-history&#34;&gt;Pre-modern history &lt;a href=&#34;#pre-modern-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts similar to &amp;ldquo;other dimensions&amp;rdquo; exist in various religious and mystical traditions. Islamic mysticism, known as Sufism, includes the concept of &lt;em&gt;al-ghayb&lt;/em&gt;, referring to the hidden and unseen. Within this tradition, &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;ālam al-mithāl&lt;/em&gt;, or &amp;ldquo;the world of similitude,&amp;rdquo; is considered an intermediary realm between the physical and spiritual worlds, inhabited by intelligent non-human entities such as jinn and angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theorists&#34;&gt;Theorists &lt;a href=&#34;#theorists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces key figures who have advanced the interdimensional UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, spiritualists believed in &amp;ldquo;other dimensions.&amp;rdquo; H.P. Blavatsky popularized the term &amp;ldquo;planes,&amp;rdquo; proposing a cosmology of seven planes. The term &amp;ldquo;ether&amp;rdquo; was adopted from ancient Greek and incorporated into occult writings. Charles Webster Leadbeater and Annie Besant introduced the &amp;ldquo;etheric plane&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;etheric body&amp;rdquo; in Theosophy. The first use of the word, as &lt;em&gt;inter-dimensional&lt;/em&gt;, is in a novel by Z Gale of 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34;&gt;Meade Layne and &amp;lsquo;Ether Ships&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meade Layne, an occultist, claimed in 1947 that flying discs were &amp;ldquo;etheric.&amp;rdquo; Layne claimed telepathic communication with &amp;ldquo;people in the saucers,&amp;rdquo; arguing that objects could pass from an etheric to a dense level of matter. He stated that these visitors were human beings living in their own world with good intentions. Layne is regarded as the earliest proponent of the interdimensional hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34;&gt;John Keel and &amp;lsquo;Ultraterrestrials&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Keel coined the term &amp;ldquo;ultraterrestrials&amp;rdquo; to describe UFO occupants as non-human entities existing in a wavelength of energy undetectable to us. In his book &lt;em&gt;UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse&lt;/em&gt;, Keel argued that a non-human intelligence has staged events to propagate erroneous belief systems, including monsters, ghosts, demons, fairies, vampires, mystery airships, anomalous creatures, poltergeists, and UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hynek-and-vallée&#34;&gt;Hynek and Vallée &lt;a href=&#34;#hynek-and-vall%c3%a9e&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and scientific advisor to the U.S. Air Force UFO studies, pioneered the &amp;ldquo;Close Encounter&amp;rdquo; classification system. Jacques Vallée, a student of Hynek, served as the inspiration for a character in the film &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Reality&lt;/em&gt;, Vallée and Hynek considered the possibility of &amp;ldquo;interlocking universes.&amp;rdquo; Vallée argued for a &amp;ldquo;parallel universe co-existing with our own&amp;rdquo; in his book &lt;em&gt;Passport to Magonia&lt;/em&gt;. Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1990 paper &amp;ldquo;Five Arguments Against the Extraterrestrial Origin of Unidentified Flying Objects&amp;rdquo; summarized his objections to the extraterrestrial hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explores the presence of the interdimensional UFO hypothesis in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 film &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&lt;/em&gt; utilizes the interdimensional hypothesis, describing ancient aliens traveling into &amp;ldquo;the space between the spaces.&amp;rdquo; The 2014 movie &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; employs a mix of the interdimensional and time-traveler hypotheses, with future humans evolving to exist in five dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section contrasts the IUH with other hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IUH contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis, which suggests UFO sightings are caused by visitations from outside Earth, and the psychosocial hypothesis, which argues UFO sightings are best explained as psychological or social phenomena. Other contrasting hypotheses include the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, space animal hypothesis, and time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; franchise is a science fiction horror and action media franchise that began with the 1979 film &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. The series centers on Ellen Ripley&amp;rsquo;s battles with the extraterrestrial Xenomorph and the prequel series following the android David 8 and the Engineers. The franchise is owned by 20th Century Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Created by:&lt;/strong&gt; Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett
&lt;strong&gt;Original Work:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; (1979)
&lt;strong&gt;Owner:&lt;/strong&gt; 20th Century Studios
&lt;strong&gt;Years Active:&lt;/strong&gt; 1979–present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise &lt;a href=&#34;#premise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise depicts deadly encounters between humanity and the Xenomorph, a hostile extraterrestrial species. Humanity is a space-faring species, and space journeys require cryosleep. The megacorporation Weyland-Yutani Corp seeks to profit from the Aliens, manipulating and endangering characters. The series also explores the origin of the human race, with the Engineers sacrificing themselves to spark the genesis of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett collaborated on the script for &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. Brandywine Productions bought the script, and 20th Century Fox invested millions after the success of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. The Ripley character was initially to be played by Tom Skerritt, but Sigourney Weaver was cast instead. Ridley Scott directed the film. H. R. Giger designed the alien creature and derelict ship, Mœbius created the spacesuits, and Ron Cobb provided the industrial design for the sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Cameron expressed interest in continuing the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; story in 1983. After Cameron&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Terminator&lt;/em&gt; became a hit, he and Gale Anne Hurd were approved to direct and produce &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. Following the second film, Weaver was not interested in returning, but she was offered a $5 million salary and a producer credit to make &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt; faced script difficulties, trouble securing a director, and studio interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production on &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt; began in 1996. Weaver joined the project after being offered an $11 million salary and more creative control. The script resurrected the Ripley character via human cloning. Joss Whedon later said that he thought it had done &amp;ldquo;everything wrong&amp;rdquo; with his script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Barney and Betty Hill incident</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_a60a980220b9/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 02:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_a60a980220b9/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article details the alleged alien abduction of Barney and Betty Hill in 1961, a case that gained significant notoriety and influenced the alien abduction narrative. The article covers the background of the Hills, the details of their reported encounter, the aftermath, analysis of the star map Betty Hill claimed to have seen, and the cultural impact of their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney and Betty Hill were an interracial couple living in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Barney was a postal worker and Betty was a social worker. They were active in civil rights and community affairs. The article also mentions that they are the grandparents of UFC fighter Angela Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-encounter&#34;&gt;UFO Encounter &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-encounter&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 19-20, 1961, the Hills claimed to have encountered a UFO while driving back from a vacation in Canada. Near Lancaster, New Hampshire, Betty noticed a bright light in the sky. They stopped near Twin Mountain to observe the object, which Betty viewed through binoculars. Barney initially thought it was a commercial airliner, but it rapidly descended towards them. They continued driving, observing the object near Cannon Mountain and the Old Man of the Mountain. South of Indian Head, the object descended rapidly, causing Barney to stop the car. He observed humanoid figures through binoculars. Fearing capture, Barney ran back to the car, and as they drove away, they heard beeping sounds and experienced a daze. They reported the incident to NICAP investigator Walter Webb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;immediate-aftermath&#34;&gt;Immediate Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#immediate-aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home, the Hills noted odd sensations and unexplained occurrences. Betty insisted on keeping their luggage near the back door. Their watches stopped working. Barney found the binocular strap torn and his shoes scraped. They both took showers to remove possible contamination and drew pictures of what they had seen. Betty&amp;rsquo;s dress was torn and had a pinkish powder on it. Shiny, concentric circles appeared on their car&amp;rsquo;s trunk, which affected a compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34;&gt;Initial Report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member, interviewed the Hills. Barney mentioned a &amp;ldquo;mental block&amp;rdquo; and suspected he was suppressing parts of the event. Webb concluded that they were truthful, and the incident likely occurred as reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bettys-dreams&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Dreams &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-dreams&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after the encounter, Betty began experiencing vivid dreams for five consecutive nights. In her dreams, they encountered a roadblock and were forced into a forest by small men in blue uniforms. The men appeared nearly human with greyish skin. They were eventually returned to their car and watched the craft depart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34;&gt;Medical Help and More Interviews &lt;a href=&#34;#medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills sought medical help to understand their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;missing-time&#34;&gt;Missing Time &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-time&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a follow-up interview with NICAP members C.D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann, the Hills realized they had &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; – a period of about seven hours they couldn&amp;rsquo;t account for. They recalled almost nothing of a 35-mile stretch of road and an image of a fiery orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;private-disclosure&#34;&gt;Private Disclosure &lt;a href=&#34;#private-disclosure&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the Hills privately disclosed their encounter to Captain Ben H. Swett of the United States Air Force, who was interested in the &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Hypnosis Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills underwent hypnosis with Dr. Benjamin Simon to recover their memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barneys-sessions&#34;&gt;Barney&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#barneys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under hypnosis, Barney recalled the binocular strap breaking as he ran from the UFO. He remembered being compelled to drive into the woods and seeing six men. He described the beings&amp;rsquo; terrifying eyes and their communication through &amp;ldquo;thought transference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bettys-sessions&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s account under hypnosis was similar to her dreams, with some differences. The technology on the craft was different, the short men differed significantly in physical appearance and the sequential order of the abduction differed. Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s memories in hypnotic regression were consistent with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simons-conclusions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Conclusions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-conclusions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon concluded that the case was a psychological aberration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34;&gt;Post-Hypnosis Publicity and Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s Death &lt;a href=&#34;#post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills initially kept a low profile. However, in 1965, a front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Boston Traveller&lt;/em&gt; revealed their story, leading to international attention. John G. Fuller wrote the book &lt;em&gt;The Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; about the case in 1966. Barney died in 1969, and Betty became a figure in the UFO community. Betty died in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-the-star-map&#34;&gt;Analyzing the Star Map &lt;a href=&#34;#analyzing-the-star-map&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Marjorie Fish, an amateur astronomer, attempted to decipher the star map Betty Hill had drawn. Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars and concluded that the map&amp;rsquo;s perspective matched the Zeta Reticuli star system. The analysis was debated, with Carl Sagan arguing it was a random alignment of points. Later, more accurate data from the Hipparcos mission led Fish to reject her hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interrupted-journey&#34;&gt;Interrupted Journey &lt;a href=&#34;#interrupted-journey&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; by John G. Fuller detailed the Hills&amp;rsquo; claims. Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s niece, Kathleen Marden, further explored these themes in &lt;em&gt;Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rebutting-the-hills&#34;&gt;Rebutting the Hills &lt;a href=&#34;#rebutting-the-hills&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Macdonald argued that the Hills&amp;rsquo; experience was caused by misinterpreting an aircraft warning beacon on Cannon Mountain, combined with stress, sleep deprivation, and false memories. Robert Sheaffer criticized Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s credibility, citing her UFO photos and later delusional stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34;&gt;Influence from &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt;. Jason Colavito pointed out other episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; that aired before Barney&amp;rsquo;s hypnosis sessions that were even more reminiscent of the Hill&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-media&#34;&gt;In Popular Media &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills&amp;rsquo; story has been depicted in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nonfictional-accounts&#34;&gt;Nonfictional Accounts &lt;a href=&#34;#nonfictional-accounts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney Hill appeared on &lt;em&gt;To Tell the Truth&lt;/em&gt; in 1966. Kathleen Marden and Stanton Friedman authored &lt;em&gt;Captured&lt;/em&gt; in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-fiction&#34;&gt;In Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1975 film &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; dramatized the Hills&amp;rsquo; abduction. The story has also been referenced in comic books, films like &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, virtual reality exhibits, and television series like &lt;em&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; which are names given in ufology to humanoid races purportedly from the Pleiades star cluster. These beings are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans, with features like tall stature (6-7 ft), blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention pale-blue/grey or pastel purple skin tones. George Adamski is noted as one of the first to report contact with these beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding them often includes telepathy, benevolence, and physical beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the historical context and cultural influences related to the Nordic alien phenomenon. David J. Skal suggests that the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; may have inspired early stories. Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; associating Nordic aliens with spiritual growth and protection. These aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned with Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal and youthful. While popular in the 1950s, claims of encounters became less common as the grey alien archetype rose to prominence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; a type of humanoid extraterrestrial beings often discussed in ufology. These beings are said to originate from the Pleiades star cluster and are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans. They are typically depicted as taller than average humans (6-7 ft), with blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention skin tones of pale blue/grey or pastel purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Adamski, a Polish-American ufologist, is noted as one of the first to publicly claim contact with Nordic beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding these beings often includes themes of telepathy, benevolence, beauty, and grace. Telepathy is often described as the primary form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context and cultural influences surrounding the Nordic alien narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural historian David J. Skal suggests that the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; may have inspired early stories of Nordic-type aliens. The film features an extraterrestrial arriving on Earth to warn humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bates College professor Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; noting that Nordic aliens are often associated with spiritual growth, love, and protection among believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of encounters with Nordic aliens were common in Europe during the 1950s but became less frequent in later decades, as the grey alien became more prevalent in extraterrestrial encounter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;correlation-between-ufo-reports-and-atomic-sites&#34;&gt;Correlation between UFO reports and atomic sites &lt;a href=&#34;#correlation-between-ufo-reports-and-atomic-sites&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the historical and statistical connections between reports of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and locations associated with atomic technology, primarily in the United States. It examines how early speculation linked UFO sightings to atomic sites, the influence of the Cold War, and various incidents and studies that have fueled this correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section establishes the context for the link between UFO reports and atomic sites. It highlights the increased scrutiny of US airspace due to national security concerns in 1947, coinciding with increased media coverage of UFO reports. It notes that the development of atomic weapons and long-range vehicles meant that even a small number of adversarial overflights could have significant national security implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1940s-weapons-development&#34;&gt;1940s weapons development &lt;a href=&#34;#1940s-weapons-development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the development of atomic weapons by the US during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. Key locations mentioned are Oak Ridge, Tennessee (uranium enrichment), Hanford, Washington (plutonium production), and Los Alamos, New Mexico (bomb design and construction). It also discusses the increased lethality and range of air power during the war and Japan&amp;rsquo;s deployment of intercontinental balloon bombs, one of which interfered with plutonium production at Hanford. The US&amp;rsquo;s Project Mogul, inspired by the Japanese balloons, aimed to detect Soviet atomic tests. The section also mentions German advancements in rockets, jet fighters, and bomber designs, which both the US and Soviet governments learned about and utilized after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;increased-scrutiny-of-us-airspace&#34;&gt;Increased scrutiny of US airspace &lt;a href=&#34;#increased-scrutiny-of-us-airspace&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains how the possibility of a Soviet atomic attack led to increased surveillance of US airspace, particularly around atomic facilities. It mentions the development of the first intercontinental bomber, the Convair B-36 Peacemaker, which could reach the Soviet Union from American soil. Atomic sites were among the first locations in the US to operate radar, supported by visual spotters and fighter squadrons. The start of the Cold War in 1947 influenced media coverage of UFO reports, treating them as potential national security threats rather than folklore or tall tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents a timeline of notable UFO incidents and their connection to atomic sites, starting in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;supposed-flying-discs-allegedly-break-sound-barrier&#34;&gt;Supposed flying discs allegedly break sound barrier &lt;a href=&#34;#supposed-flying-discs-allegedly-break-sound-barrier&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the Kenneth Arnold sighting in June 1947, where he reported seeing nine objects flying at supersonic speeds near Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in Washington state. The proximity of this sighting to the Hanford plutonium plant led to media speculation about a connection. The section also notes that the sound barrier was not officially broken until October 1947 by Chuck Yeager, and the Air Force initially denied the achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roswell-and-atomic-weapons&#34;&gt;Roswell and atomic weapons &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-and-atomic-weapons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the Roswell incident in July 1947, where debris was found on a ranch near Corona, New Mexico. The 509th at Roswell was the Army&amp;rsquo;s atomic bomb group. The initial explanation of a weather balloon was later questioned, and the Air Force eventually concluded the debris came from a Project Mogul balloon designed to detect Soviet atomic tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;public-claims-of-link-to-atomic-sites&#34;&gt;Public claims of link to atomic sites &lt;a href=&#34;#public-claims-of-link-to-atomic-sites&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the public&amp;rsquo;s perception of a link between flying discs and atomic weaponry in 1947. It mentions headlines claiming a connection between &amp;ldquo;discs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;atom products,&amp;rdquo; citing an unnamed scientist from the Manhattan Project who suggested experiments in atomic energy transmutation were responsible for the sightings. The Hanford works were also mentioned as a location with numerous UFO reports. Atomic scientists Harold Urey and David E. Lilienthal dismissed these claims as &amp;ldquo;gibberish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mantell-crash-near-oak-ridge&#34;&gt;Mantell crash near Oak Ridge &lt;a href=&#34;#mantell-crash-near-oak-ridge&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Mantell incident in January 1948, where Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a pilot from Fort Knox, Kentucky, crashed while pursuing a UFO near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Air Force later attributed the UFO to a Skyhook balloon, a classified project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;green-fireballs-near-hanford&#34;&gt;Green Fireballs near Hanford &lt;a href=&#34;#green-fireballs-near-hanford&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses reports of green fireballs near Hanford, Washington, starting in December 1948. It mentions Lincoln LaPaz&amp;rsquo;s investigation of these reports and the issuance of orders to fire on potentially hostile aircraft over Hanford and Oak Ridge. The section also notes UFO reports over Hanford and Oak Ridge during the early days of the Korean War and a 1952 Life Magazine article reporting unusual radar returns near an atomic installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contactees-and-nuclear-war&#34;&gt;Contactees and nuclear war &lt;a href=&#34;#contactees-and-nuclear-war&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the theme of nuclear war in UFO culture. The 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; featured a benevolent spaceman warning about atomic weapons. George Adamski began claiming contact with &amp;ldquo;space brothers&amp;rdquo; concerned about atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;big-sur-missile-test&#34;&gt;Big Sur missile test &lt;a href=&#34;#big-sur-missile-test&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a reported UFO incident during a 1964 Air Force missile test near Big Sur, California. Robert Jacobs, who oversaw the team, claimed a UFO interfered with the test. Kingston George, the project engineer, argued the team had actually recorded the release of decoy warheads and chaff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;malmstrom-missile-malfunction&#34;&gt;Malmstrom missile malfunction &lt;a href=&#34;#malmstrom-missile-malfunction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses UFO reports over a missile complex in March 1967 during a routine malfunction. Retired Air Force personnel later claimed the weapons failure was caused by a UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hynek-suggests-atomic-link&#34;&gt;Hynek suggests atomic link &lt;a href=&#34;#hynek-suggests-atomic-link&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes that astronomer J. Allen Hynek, initially hired by the Air Force to debunk UFO reports, began speculating in 1968 that UFOs might be related to an unknown phenomenon connected to nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rendelsham&#34;&gt;Rendelsham &lt;a href=&#34;#rendelsham&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the Rendlesham Forest incident in December 1980, a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights near RAF Woodbridge in England, which was used by the United States Air Force (USAF). USAF personnel, including Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt, claimed to see things they described as a UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers more recent developments, including a legend that the 1945 Trinity atomic bomb test brought down an alien spacecraft. It mentions Robert Hastings&amp;rsquo; book &lt;em&gt;UFOs &amp;amp; Nukes: Extraordinary Encounters at Nuclear Weapons Sites&lt;/em&gt; and claims by former AATIP director Luis Elizondo and former U.S. Air Force personnel that UAPs have interfered with nuclear capabilities. It also notes reports of UFOs interfering with other major powers&amp;rsquo; nuclear weapons systems. The section mentions the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act requesting more information on UAP incidents associated with military nuclear assets and claims by Robert L. Salas and Robert Hastings of alien abduction. Finally, it mentions that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission will raise the issue of UAP with its United States counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;statistical-studies&#34;&gt;Statistical studies &lt;a href=&#34;#statistical-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the statistical evidence for a correlation between UFO reports and atomic sites, considering the possibility of observational bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It introduces the concept of the &amp;ldquo;streetlight effect,&amp;rdquo; where observations are more likely to be reported where observations are most likely to occur. Mainstream experts argue that increased scrutiny of airspace around strategically important facilities explains the correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section mentions a rudimentary spatial analysis conducted by Air Force officers in the 1950s, which found that UFOs were seen more frequently around areas vital to US defense, such as Los Alamos-Albuquerque, Oak Ridge, and White Sands Proving Ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 study of UFO reports in France concluded that there was a statistically significant link between nuclear activities and unexplained UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 document from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence suggested that clustering of UFO reports around US training and testing grounds might be due to &amp;ldquo;collection bias as a result of focused attention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study examined a National UFO Reporting Center dataset and found that UFO reports are more frequent in areas with darker nighttime skies and &amp;ldquo;wide-open spaces.&amp;rdquo; Additionally, analysis suggested that proximity to airports and military installations was linked to increased UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;contact-1985-novel&#34;&gt;Contact (1985 novel) &lt;a href=&#34;#contact-1985-novel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article provides information about Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 science fiction novel, &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;. It distinguishes the novel from other works with the same title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot centers around Eleanor &amp;ldquo;Ellie&amp;rdquo; Arroway, a scientist with a strong aptitude for science and mathematics. Her father&amp;rsquo;s death deeply affects her, and she finds herself at odds with her stepfather. Ellie pursues a career in radio astronomy, eventually directing Project Argus, a SETI initiative in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project detects a signal from Vega, which is analyzed and found to contain a retransmission of Hitler&amp;rsquo;s 1936 Olympic speech. Later, a third message reveals plans for an advanced machine. Ellie works with Ken der Heer and Vaygay Lunacharsky to decipher the message. Religious leaders Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss also become involved. The final piece of the message is discovered with the help of S.R. Hadden, revealing the primer needed to build the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A race to build the machine ensues between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. An extremist bombing delays the project. Ellie learns Hadden has secretly built a third machine in Hokkaido, Japan. Ellie, Vaygay, Devi Sukhavati, Abonnema Eda, and Xi Qiaomu travel through wormholes to a station near the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s center. There, they meet extraterrestrials who explain their motives and a project to alter the universe&amp;rsquo;s properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to Earth, the travelers find their journey seemingly took no time at all. Their video recordings are erased, and officials suspect a hoax. Ellie finds evidence of her journey in the digits of pi, confirming the reality of her experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publication-history&#34;&gt;Publication history &lt;a href=&#34;#publication-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, Sagan was inspired by science fiction and fantasy. He preferred realistic stories that helped readers understand real science and history. In 1978, Sagan predicted that science fiction would make young people interested in extraterrestrial contact. Simon &amp;amp; Schuster gave Sagan a $2 million advance on the novel in 1981. Kip Thorne provided Sagan with ideas on wormholes. Eleanor Arroway was named after Eleanor Roosevelt and Voltaire. The character is based on Jill Tarter. The novel won the Locus Award for Best First Novel in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First contact (science fiction)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_2ec54f2d6fb4/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 03:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_2ec54f2d6fb4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-contact-science-fiction&#34;&gt;First Contact (Science Fiction) &lt;a href=&#34;#first-contact-science-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact is a recurring theme in science fiction, exploring the initial meeting between humans and extraterrestrial life or any sentient species from different planets or natural satellites. It draws parallels with the anthropological concept of first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept dates back to the 2nd century AD with Lucian of Samosata&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A True Story&lt;/em&gt;. Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Le Micromégas&lt;/em&gt; (1752) features an alien from Sirius visiting Earth and engaging in philosophical discussions with humans. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; is traditionally credited with popularizing the trope of conflict between humans and alien intelligent species, although earlier examples exist, such as &lt;em&gt;Les Xipéhuz&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1950s saw a surge in first contact stories in the United States, often reflecting Cold War anxieties about nuclear holocaust or communist invasion. Films like &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; (1951) began to portray first contact as potentially beneficial, while &lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/em&gt; (1956) reflected fears of communist infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt; depicts both positive and negative consequences of first contact, while Stanisław Lem&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Solaris&lt;/em&gt; explores the futility of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise introduced the Prime Directive, a non-interference regulation, which has since become a common trope in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later works include &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; (1985), and novels like &lt;em&gt;The Sparrow&lt;/em&gt; (1996) and &lt;em&gt;The Three-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt; (2006). Films like &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; (2016) focus on the linguistic challenges of first contact. &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; (2021) depicts an unintended first contact scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-and-themes&#34;&gt;Types and Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#types-and-themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact stories vary widely in their methods of contact and the nature of the subsequent interaction. These variations include positive vs. negative outcomes, physical meetings vs. message interception, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien invasion is a common early trope, popularized by &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. During the Cold War, these stories often reflected American anxieties about the Soviet Union, with infiltration narratives being a variation on the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-artifacts&#34;&gt;Alien Artifacts &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-artifacts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bracewell probes, hypothesized by Ronald N. Bracewell, are extraterrestrial artifacts that allow real-time communication. Big Dumb Objects, such as megastructures like ringworlds, are a common variation. &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; features mysterious black Monoliths that enhance technological progress. Stories also involve finding alien spacecraft, such as in &lt;em&gt;Rendezvous with Rama&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication-with-alien-intelligence&#34;&gt;Communication with Alien Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#communication-with-alien-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stories deal with the challenges of communication. Stanisław Lem&amp;rsquo;s works often portray mutual understanding between humans and aliens as impossible, criticizing the idea of cognitive universality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;message-from-space&#34;&gt;Message from Space &lt;a href=&#34;#message-from-space&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact may occur through the detection of an extraterrestrial signal or technosignature. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) began with the advent of radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alien-languages&#34;&gt;Alien Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages are a common form of communication with aliens, and many stories explore language issues. While space operas often use universal translators, hard science fiction typically depicts the difficulties of communicating with aliens, which can lead to misunderstandings and even war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ethics-of-first-contact&#34;&gt;Ethics of First Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#ethics-of-first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many writers have considered how humans should treat aliens upon first contact. The Prime Directive of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; is a notable example of non-interference. In Soviet science fiction, &amp;ldquo;progressors&amp;rdquo; worked clandestinely to improve less advanced civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-examples&#34;&gt;Notable Examples &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-examples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-the-earth-stood-still&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-day-the-earth-stood-still&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the short story &amp;ldquo;Farewell to the Master,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; depicts the arrival of Klaatu and Gort in Washington, D.C. Humanity&amp;rsquo;s hostile response to first contact is used as an allegory for the Second Red Scare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1977 film by Steven Spielberg tells the story of Roy Neary, whose life changes after an encounter with a UFO. The film was deemed &amp;ldquo;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&amp;rdquo; by the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 novel, later adapted into a film, depicts the reception of a radio signal from Vega and the construction of a Machine based on the message&amp;rsquo;s specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;star-trek&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact is central to Starfleet operations in the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise. The Prime Directive is a foundational regulation, though it is frequently violated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-the-original-series&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-the-original-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original pilot episode features the Talosians. The Prime Directive was introduced in &amp;ldquo;The Return of the Archons&amp;rdquo; to prevent negative consequences from contact with technologically inferior societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-the-next-generation&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-the-next-generation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot episode, &amp;ldquo;Encounter at Farpoint,&amp;rdquo; depicts first contact with the Q Continuum. Episodes like &amp;ldquo;Who Watches the Watchers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; center on the Prime Directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-first-contact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1996 film portrays first contact between humans and Vulcans, leading to the formation of the United Federation of Planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-war-of-the-worlds&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-war-of-the-worlds&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; novel details a conflict between humankind and Martians. It has been adapted into numerous films, radio dramas, and other media. The 1938 radio drama, directed by Orson Welles, reportedly caused panic among listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-seti&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-seti&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) encompasses various scientific projects aimed at detecting signals or evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth. These efforts involve monitoring electromagnetic radiation, searching for optical signals, and investigating potential extraterrestrial artifacts. Some initiatives, like NASA&amp;rsquo;s Golden Record, have also attempted to send messages to hypothetical alien civilizations. Despite decades of searching, no confirmed evidence of alien intelligence has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the historical progression of SETI efforts, from early speculations to modern scientific projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-work&#34;&gt;Early Work &lt;a href=&#34;#early-work&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early searches for extraterrestrial intelligence within the Solar System are highlighted. Nikola Tesla suggested using his wireless electrical transmission system to contact beings on Mars in 1896. In 1899, he thought he detected a signal from Mars at his Colorado Springs experimental station. Guglielmo Marconi, Lord Kelvin, and David Peck Todd also believed radio could be used to contact Martians in the early 1900s. In 1924, during a close opposition of Mars, the United States observed a &amp;ldquo;National Radio Silence Day&amp;rdquo; to listen for Martian signals, with William F. Friedman assigned to translate any potential messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-ozma-and-early-radio-astronomy&#34;&gt;Project Ozma and Early Radio Astronomy &lt;a href=&#34;#project-ozma-and-early-radio-astronomy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of searching the microwave spectrum was first pointed out in a 1959 paper by Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi. In 1960, Frank Drake performed the first modern SETI experiment, Project Ozma, at Green Bank, West Virginia, examining the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. Soviet scientists also took a strong interest in SETI during the 1960s. Iosif Shklovsky wrote the book &lt;em&gt;Universe, Life, Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; (1962), which was expanded upon by Carl Sagan as &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966). John D. Kraus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Ear&amp;rdquo; radio telescope at Ohio State University began the world&amp;rsquo;s first continuous SETI program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-cyclops-and-the-wow-signal&#34;&gt;Project Cyclops and the Wow! Signal &lt;a href=&#34;#project-cyclops-and-the-wow-signal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, NASA funded a SETI study that proposed the construction of an Earth-based radio telescope array with 1,500 dishes known as Project Cyclops. The project was not built, but the report formed the basis of much SETI work that followed. The Ohio State SETI program gained fame on August 15, 1977, when Jerry Ehman witnessed a strong signal, the Wow! signal, which is considered by some to be the best candidate for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source ever discovered. In May 2023, a test extraterrestrial signal was transmitted to radio telescopes on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sentinel-meta-and-beta&#34;&gt;Sentinel, META, and BETA &lt;a href=&#34;#sentinel-meta-and-beta&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman founded the U.S. Planetary Society, partly as a vehicle for SETI studies. In the early 1980s, Harvard University physicist Paul Horowitz proposed the design of a spectrum analyzer specifically intended to search for SETI transmissions. This work led to &amp;ldquo;Suitcase SETI&amp;rdquo; in 1981, followed by Project META in 1985, and Project BETA in 1995. On March 23, 1999, the 26-meter radio telescope on which Sentinel, META and BETA were based was blown over by strong winds and seriously damaged, forcing the BETA project to cease operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, the NASA SETI program was heavily criticized by Senator William Proxmire, and funding for SETI research was removed from the NASA budget by Congress in 1981. In 1992, the U.S. government funded an operational SETI program, in the form of the NASA Microwave Observing Program (MOP). MOP was canceled one year after its start. In 1995, the SETI Institute resurrected the MOP program under the name of Project Phoenix, under the direction of Jill Tarter. From 1995 through March 2004, Phoenix conducted observations at the Parkes radio telescope in Australia, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the current state of radio-based SETI projects and the rationale behind focusing on radio frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many radio frequencies penetrate Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere well, leading to the development of radio telescopes. Human endeavors emit considerable electromagnetic radiation, which could be recognizable as artificial signals. Earth has been sending radio waves into space for over 100 years, reaching over 1,000 stars. Many international radio telescopes are currently being used for radio SETI searches, including the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Australia, and the Lovell Telescope in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;allen-telescope-array&#34;&gt;Allen Telescope Array &lt;a href=&#34;#allen-telescope-array&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SETI Institute collaborated with the Radio Astronomy Laboratory at the Berkeley SETI Research Center to develop the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). The array has 42 operational dishes at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in rural northern California. The SETI Institute&amp;rsquo;s Center for SETI Research (CSR) uses ATA in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, observing 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Berkeley astronomers used the ATA to pursue several science topics until 2011, when the collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley and the SETI Institute was terminated. In 2012, the ATA was revitalized with a donation by Franklin Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;serendip&#34;&gt;SERENDIP &lt;a href=&#34;#serendip&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SERENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) is a SETI program launched in 1979 by the Berkeley SETI Research Center. SERENDIP analyzes deep space radio telescope data that it obtains while other astronomers are using the telescopes. The most recently deployed SERENDIP spectrometer, SERENDIP VI, was installed at both the Arecibo Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope in 2014–2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breakthrough-listen&#34;&gt;Breakthrough Listen &lt;a href=&#34;#breakthrough-listen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breakthrough Listen&lt;/em&gt; is a ten-year initiative with $100 million funding begun in July 2015 to actively search for intelligent extraterrestrial communications in the universe. The science program for Breakthrough Listen is based at Berkeley SETI Research Center. The project is observing for thousands of hours every year on two major radio telescopes, the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, and the Parkes Observatory in Australia. Frank Drake was one of the scientists on the project&amp;rsquo;s advisory committee. In October 2019, Breakthrough Listen started a collaboration with scientists from the TESS team to look for signs of advanced extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fast&#34;&gt;FAST &lt;a href=&#34;#fast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s 500 meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) lists &lt;em&gt;detecting interstellar communication signals&lt;/em&gt; as part of its science mission. FAST is the first radio observatory built with SETI as a core scientific goal. On 14 June 2022, astronomers, working with China&amp;rsquo;s FAST telescope, reported the possibility of having detected artificial signals, but cautioned that further studies were required to determine if a natural radio interference may be the source. Dan Werthimer noted, &amp;ldquo;These signals are from radio interference; they are due to radio pollution from earthlings, not from E.T.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ucla&#34;&gt;UCLA &lt;a href=&#34;#ucla&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) undergraduate and graduate students have been participating in radio searches for technosignatures with the Green Bank Telescope. Targets include the Kepler field, TRAPPIST-1, and solar-type stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;community-seti-projects&#34;&gt;Community SETI Projects &lt;a href=&#34;#community-seti-projects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights SETI projects that rely on the contributions of volunteers and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setihome&#34;&gt;SETI@home &lt;a href=&#34;#setihome&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SETI@home project used volunteer computing to analyze signals acquired by the SERENDIP project. The SETI@home project was launched by the Berkeley SETI Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, in May 1999. The project is run by director David P. Anderson and chief scientist Dan Werthimer. On March 31, 2020, the project stopped sending out new work to SETI@home users, bringing this particular SETI effort to an indefinite hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seti-net&#34;&gt;SETI Net &lt;a href=&#34;#seti-net&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SETI Network was the only fully operational private search system. SETI Net started operation in the early 1980s as a way to learn about the science of the search, and developed several software packages for the amateur SETI community. SETI Net went dark and was decommissioned on 2021-12-04.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1994 in response to the United States Congress cancellation of the NASA SETI program, The SETI League, Incorporated is a membership-supported nonprofit organization. This grass-roots alliance of amateur and professional radio astronomers is headed by executive director emeritus H. Paul Shuch. The organization concentrates on coordinating a global network of small, amateur-built radio telescopes under Project Argus, an all-sky survey seeking to achieve real-time coverage of the entire sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extraterrestrial intelligence using optical wavelengths, such as lasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some SETI researchers have considered the possibility that alien civilizations might be using powerful lasers for interstellar communications at optical wavelengths. There are two problems with optical SETI: lasers are highly &amp;ldquo;monochromatic&amp;rdquo;, and lasers are highly directional&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-travis-walton-incident&#34;&gt;The Travis Walton Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#the-travis-walton-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Travis Walton incident is an alleged alien abduction that occurred on November 5, 1975, involving American forestry worker Travis Walton in the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests near Heber, Arizona. The incident is widely considered a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the alleged abduction, noting that in the early 1970s, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; tabloid offered a substantial prize for proof of extraterrestrial visitors, which may have motivated the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34;&gt;Travis Walton and the Turkey Springs forestry job &lt;a href=&#34;#travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the circumstances surrounding Travis Walton&amp;rsquo;s employment and the forestry contract. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; The forestry job was located in Turkey Springs, about 12 miles south of Heber, Arizona. The crew lived in Snowflake, 30 miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis Walton, his brother Duane, and crew chief Michael H. Rogers are central figures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Motive:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers&amp;rsquo;s forestry contract was behind schedule, potentially leading to financial penalties. The section notes that Walton had a prior criminal record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The Turkey Springs job involved thinning 1,277 acres by August 1975, later extended to November 10. Failure to complete the job could result in a $2,500 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Barney Hill and NBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the potential influence of the 1975 NBC television movie &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt;, which dramatized the alleged abduction of Barney and Betty Hill. It suggests that the film may have inspired Walton and Rogers to fabricate their own abduction story. Skeptics and psychologists are quoted arguing that the film could have motivated someone to claim an abduction for attention. It also mentions that Travis Walton told his mother not to worry if he were ever abducted by aliens because he would return safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the events of November 5, 1975, when Michael H. Rogers reported Travis Walton missing. The crew claimed they saw a lit object near the roadway, Walton approached it, and was struck by a light. The crew drove away in fear and returned to find Walton and the object gone. The police were notified, and a search was initiated. Deputy Kenneth Coplan noted the calm reaction of Walton&amp;rsquo;s mother to the news of his disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-person-investigation&#34;&gt;Missing person investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-person-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the search efforts and initial investigation following Walton&amp;rsquo;s disappearance. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Party:&lt;/strong&gt; A search party of nearly 50 people scoured the Turkey Springs area without success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&amp;rsquo;s Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Law enforcement were surprised by the calm reaction of Travis&amp;rsquo;s mother, who believed he was no longer on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFO Interest:&lt;/strong&gt; It was revealed that Travis, Duane, and their mother were interested in UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers and the crew underwent polygraph examinations to determine if they had harmed Walton. Five were deemed truthful, while one was inconclusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act of God Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers discussed the Forestry contract and the potential for an &amp;ldquo;Act of God&amp;rdquo; clause to excuse the delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walton-returns&#34;&gt;Walton returns &lt;a href=&#34;#walton-returns&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes Walton&amp;rsquo;s reappearance and subsequent events. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton called his sister&amp;rsquo;s home from a payphone in Heber, Arizona, on November 12, shortly after midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deputy Glen Flake:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy Flake witnessed Duane Walton transferring fuel from one car to another after having forgotten to purchase gas before local stations closed. Flake did not reveal that they knew Travis had returned home, and Duane did not tell the deputy that Travis had been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Duane sought medical attention for Travis, consulting with a hypnotherapist and later two medical doctors who were also amateur UFO investigators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheriff Gillespie:&lt;/strong&gt; Sheriff Gillespie insisted on interviewing Travis, but Duane and Travis demanded that the interview not be recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; provided a suite at the Sheraton Inn in Scottsdale in exchange for exclusive access to Walton and his story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis skipped a polygraph interview with police, but was later interviewed by Jack McCarthy a free-lance polygraph examiner arranged by a UFO group and the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;. McCarthy concluded that Travis was engaged in a &amp;ldquo;gross deception&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Television Interview:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton appeared on Phoenix television, claiming he lost consciousness and awoke in a hospital-like room with short, bald creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publicity-and-popular-culture&#34;&gt;Publicity and popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the media attention and cultural impact of the Walton incident. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for &amp;ldquo;best UFO case of the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism:&lt;/strong&gt; Skeptics, including Philip J. Klass, viewed the story as a hoax for financial gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book and Film:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton wrote &lt;em&gt;The Walton Experience&lt;/em&gt; in 1978, which was adapted into the 1993 film &lt;em&gt;Fire in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Appearances:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton has appeared at UFO conventions and on television, including &lt;em&gt;The Moment of Truth&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; podcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_96b21753a786/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ancient-astronauts&#34;&gt;Ancient Astronauts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-astronauts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected the development of cultures, technologies, religions, and even human biology. A common idea is that deities in many religions were actually extraterrestrials, and their advanced technologies were seen as divine powers by early humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is rejected by academics and archaeologists, who consider it pseudoarchaeology and unscientific. Claims are often based on distorted or fabricated evidence. Some critics argue that ancient astronaut theories have racist implications, diminishing the achievements of indigenous cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable proponents in the late 20th century include Robert Charroux, Jacques Bergier, Jean Sendy, Erich von Däniken, Alexander Kazantsev, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, David Hatcher Childress, Peter Kolosimo, and Mauro Biglino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers often claim that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence that landed on Earth in the past. They suggest that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these ancient alien visitors, who acted as a &amp;ldquo;mother culture.&amp;rdquo; Proponents also claim that extraterrestrials built or helped humans build structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island. Evidence is said to come from gaps in historical and archaeological records, as well as artifacts that are considered anachronistic and beyond the technical capabilities of ancient people. These &amp;ldquo;out-of-place artifacts&amp;rdquo; include artwork and legends reinterpreted to support extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is featured in fringe media, such as the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The show mixes fact with fiction to promote theories of an alternate past, often incorporating white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents portray themselves as an oppressed minority of academics challenging mainstream archaeology, despite lacking credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like past archaeological endeavors, the focus is on monumental structures, suggesting that indigenous people could not have built them without alien help. However, some indigenous voices argue that ancient alien theory supports their stories of extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme is the portrayal of aliens as light-skinned or Aryan, as claimed by Erich von Däniken. Some proponents are associated with white supremacism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream archaeologists have largely ignored these claims, while popular science explainers and skeptics have criticized them. Carl Sagan noted that cases of apparent interest have reasonable alternative explanations, misreporting, or are hoaxes and distortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34;&gt;History of Ancient Aliens Beliefs and Their Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleocontact narratives appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt; (1898) and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It gained popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and Erich von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s works. Critics emerged in the 1970s, discrediting Von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s claims. By the early 1980s, support dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shklovskii-and-sagan&#34;&gt;Shklovskii and Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#shklovskii-and-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan co-authored &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966) with Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky. In &lt;em&gt;Broca&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1979), Sagan expressed disapproval of writers like von Däniken who treated speculations as valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact. Sagan noted that many legends, artifacts, and out-of-place artifacts cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses could be explained with conventional hypotheses. He reiterated that extraterrestrial visits were possible but unproven and improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;erich-von-däniken&#34;&gt;Erich von Däniken &lt;a href=&#34;#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erich von Däniken became a leading proponent in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his book &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; (1968) and its sequels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken argued that certain artifacts required more advanced technology than was available to ancient cultures. He claimed that these artifacts were constructed by extraterrestrial visitors or humans who learned from them. Examples include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote that ancient art and iconography depict air and space vehicles, intelligent non-human creatures, ancient astronauts, and advanced technology. He also stated that geographically separated cultures share artistic themes, implying a common origin. One example is his interpretation of the sarcophagus lid from the tomb of Pacal the Great in Palenque, which he saw as a seated astronaut, while Maya texts identify it as a portrait of the ruler with the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken interpreted the origins of many religions as reactions to encounters with an alien race, whose technology was seen as supernatural. He stated that religious traditions contain references to alien visitors, such as Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s revelation, which he interpreted as a landing spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. through the NBC-TV documentary &lt;em&gt;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; and the film &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, made unfounded claims, and failed to validate his core claims. Christian creationists also criticized his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Nazca Lines, von Däniken stated that they resembled an airfield when seen from the air. Kenneth L. Feder argues that readers seeing the Nazca Lines in a book about aliens would be more likely to associate them with extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, von Däniken admitted that the Nazca markings could have been laid out using a system of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Earth Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; series revolves around his interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts. He hypothesized that the gods of Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet Nibiru, which the Sumerians believed to be a remote &amp;ldquo;12th planet&amp;rdquo; associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru orbits the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin argued that Sumerian texts tell the story of 50 Anunnaki from Nibiru who came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago to mine raw materials, especially gold. They genetically engineered laborers, creating &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/em&gt;: the &amp;ldquo;Adapa&amp;rdquo; or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended that the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the end of the last ice age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been criticized by professionals. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s translations are inconsistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan F. Alford, author of &lt;em&gt;Gods of the New Millennium&lt;/em&gt;, initially adhered to Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses but later found fault, stating that the gods personified the falling sky and that the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;robert-temple&#34;&gt;Robert Temple &lt;a href=&#34;#robert-temple&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert K. G. Temple&amp;rsquo;s 1976 book, &lt;em&gt;The Sirius Mystery,&lt;/em&gt; argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He cites advanced astronomical knowledge, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations. His work draws on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies and suggest that the Dogon may have received their astronomical information recently from European sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various new religious movements, including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, Raëlism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate, believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many see ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities suggesting that members associate enchantment with science fiction memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;claims-of-proponents&#34;&gt;Claims of Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#claims-of-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; cited as evidence can be explained without invoking ancient astronauts. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ancient-religious-texts&#34;&gt;Ancient Religious Texts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-religious-texts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents cite ancient mythologies, suggesting that creation myths of gods descending from the heavens to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors. They draw an analogy to cargo cults, where isolated cultures believed Western ships and cargo were sent from the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Sumerian myth of &lt;em&gt;Enûma Eliš&lt;/em&gt; says humankind was created to serve gods called the &amp;ldquo;Annunaki.&amp;rdquo; Proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to Earth to mine gold and created the human race as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ramayana&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ramayana&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel in flying vehicles called Vimana. The &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; mentions these flying objects, used by the Lankan king Ravana from Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples from the &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; include descriptions of the Pushpak chariot, a&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;conspiracy-theories-alleging-connections-between-ufos-and-nazi-germany&#34;&gt;Conspiracy theories alleging connections between UFOs and Nazi Germany &lt;a href=&#34;#conspiracy-theories-alleging-connections-between-ufos-and-nazi-germany&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the conspiracy theories linking UFOs to Nazi Germany, asserting that the Nazis attempted to develop advanced aircraft and spacecraft before and during World War II. It further claims that these craft survived in secret underground bases in Antarctica, South America, or the United States, along with their creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-ufos-as-possible-nazi-technology&#34;&gt;Early UFOs as possible Nazi technology &lt;a href=&#34;#early-ufos-as-possible-nazi-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses how unusual aerial sightings during and after World War II were initially attributed to novel Nazi technology. During the Cold War, speculation arose that the Soviets might be deploying captured or reverse-engineered Nazi technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foo-fighters&#34;&gt;Foo fighters &lt;a href=&#34;#foo-fighters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis personnel witnessed unusual aerial phenomena called &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; While some reports were dismissed as misperceptions, others were taken seriously, leading scientists like Luis Alvarez to investigate. Allied intelligence suspected some foo fighters were advanced German aircraft or weapons, given Germany&amp;rsquo;s technological innovations like V-1 and V-2 missiles and the Me 262 jet fighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ghost-rockets&#34;&gt;Ghost rockets &lt;a href=&#34;#ghost-rockets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1946, rocket- or missile-shaped UFOs, known as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were sighted primarily in Sweden and nearby countries. Finnish observers made the first reports in February 1946. Investigations suggested some sightings were meteors, but others displayed characteristics inconsistent with meteors, such as maneuverability. It was initially believed that the ghost rockets originated from the former German rocket facility at Peenemünde and were Soviet tests of captured German missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flying-discs&#34;&gt;Flying discs &lt;a href=&#34;#flying-discs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting of crescent-shaped objects, speculation about German technology resurfaced. Project Sign personnel noted similarities between the Horten brothers&amp;rsquo; flying wing designs and some UFO reports. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of Project Blue Book, noted that the Germans had several radical aircraft and guided missiles under development at the end of WWII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest media assertion of German flying saucers appeared in the Italian newspaper &lt;em&gt;Il Giornale d&amp;rsquo;Italia&lt;/em&gt; in 1950. Professor Giuseppe Belluzzo claimed that flying discs were designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same month, German technician Rudolf Schriever claimed to &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt; that he designed a craft powered by rotating turbine blades while working at BMW&amp;rsquo;s Prague works until April 1945. He said his designs were stolen, and he believed Czech agents built his craft for a foreign power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1953, German engineer Georg Klein claimed that designs similar to Avro Canada&amp;rsquo;s Avrocar had been developed during the Nazi era. Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks: one developed by Richard Miethe in Breslau and another developed by Rudolf Schriever and Klaus Habermohl in Prague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeronautical engineer Roy Fedden stated in 1945 that the only craft that could approach the capabilities attributed to flying saucers were those being designed by the Germans towards the end of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nazi-ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Nazi UFO conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&#34;#nazi-ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the 1960s, fringe authors began circulating tales of Nazi UFOs tied to the occult or aliens. These theories reference various potential code-names or sub-classifications of Nazi UFO craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German UFO literature often aligns with documented history regarding Nazi Germany&amp;rsquo;s claim to New Swabia in Antarctica and its research into advanced propulsion technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-morning-of-the-magicians&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning of the Magicians&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-morning-of-the-magicians&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Matin des Magiciens&lt;/em&gt;, a 1960 book by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, made claims about the Vril Society of Berlin. Later writers, including Jan van Helsing, Norbert-Jürgen Ratthofer, and Vladimir Terziski, connected the Vril Society with UFOs, claiming the society contacted an alien race and developed spacecraft to reach them. They allege that the Vril Society, in partnership with the Thule Society and the Nazi Party, developed flying disc prototypes and retreated to a base in Antarctica after the Nazi defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-works-of-ernst-zündel&#34;&gt;The works of Ernst Zündel &lt;a href=&#34;#the-works-of-ernst-z%c3%bcndel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst Zündel&amp;rsquo;s Samisdat Publishers claimed that flying saucers were Nazi secret weapons launched from an underground base in Antarctica, aiming to conquer Earth and other planets. Zündel also sold seats on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the hollow earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miguel-serranos-book&#34;&gt;Miguel Serrano&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;#miguel-serranos-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Miguel Serrano published &lt;em&gt;El Cordón Dorado: Hitlerismo Esotérico&lt;/em&gt;, claiming that Adolf Hitler was an Avatar of Vishnu communing with Hyperborean gods in an underground Antarctic base in New Swabia. Serrano predicted that Hitler would lead a fleet of UFOs from the base to establish the Fourth Reich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;die-glocke&#34;&gt;Die Glocke &lt;a href=&#34;#die-glocke&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Glocke&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;The Bell&amp;rdquo;) was a purported top-secret Nazi scientific technological device or &lt;em&gt;Wunderwaffe&lt;/em&gt;. First described by Igor Witkowski in &lt;em&gt;Prawda o Wunderwaffe&lt;/em&gt; (2000) and popularized by Nick Cook, it was associated with Nazi occultism, antigravity, and free energy suppression research. Claims about Die Glocke have been criticized as fictional and a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists examples of Nazi UFOs appearing in popular culture, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert A. Heinlein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Rocket Ship Galileo&lt;/em&gt; (1947) featuring a Nazi Moon base.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The movie &lt;em&gt;Iron Sky&lt;/em&gt; (2012) featuring a Nazi base on the moon launching an assault on Earth with flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revell releasing a scale model kit of a Nazi flying saucer called &amp;ldquo;Haunebu II&amp;rdquo; (2018), which was later removed from production due to historical inaccuracies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The video game &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&lt;/em&gt; (2017) featuring &amp;ldquo;Haunebu-V&amp;rdquo; craft manufactured in Nazi-controlled Roswell, New Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Commando Comic Flight of Fancy (2017) featuring the Schriever Flugkreisel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second season finale of &lt;em&gt;30 Coins&lt;/em&gt; (2023) mentioning Haunebu UFOs as copies of Nazca UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Psychosocial UFO hypothesis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_89f0f0eb48db/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;psychosocial-hypothesis-in-ufology&#34;&gt;Psychosocial Hypothesis in Ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#psychosocial-hypothesis-in-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychosocial hypothesis (PSH) in ufology posits that psychological and social factors best explain some UFO reports. It contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH). This perspective is favored by UFO researchers in the UK, including David Clarke and Hilary Evans, and in France, following Michel Monnerie&amp;rsquo;s 1977 book. PSH researchers distinguish themselves from debunkers by maintaining a serious, albeit skeptical, interest in UFOs. The hypothesis suggests that mundane explanations combined with emotional climates distort perceptions, and that claims of contact with extraterrestrials from uninhabitable planets point to psychological processes like dreams and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origin&#34;&gt;Origin &lt;a href=&#34;#origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;psychosocial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; gained prominence in English UFO literature in 1984, with Jacques Scornaux and Peter Rogerson&amp;rsquo;s article in &lt;em&gt;Magonia&lt;/em&gt;. Scornaux&amp;rsquo;s use of the term originated from French UFO controversies sparked by Michel Monnerie&amp;rsquo;s challenge to the ETH. Rogerson&amp;rsquo;s adoption of the term marked a shift from paranormal explanations to normal psychological processes influenced by cultural myths and social conditioning. Writers for &lt;em&gt;Magonia&lt;/em&gt; had been exploring alternatives to the ETH since 1968, noting the failure of the ETH to account for high strangeness cases. Roger Sandell&amp;rsquo;s research on a 1905 Welsh UFO wave led him to believe that UFO reports were part of a larger complex of ghost stories and religious visions. Peter Rogerson advocated for a search for historical antecedents of UFO rumors and the social factors driving UFO flaps and social panics, noting a relationship between UFO waves and times of radical social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;science-fiction-aspects-of-the-ufo-mythos&#34;&gt;Science Fiction Aspects of the UFO Mythos &lt;a href=&#34;#science-fiction-aspects-of-the-ufo-mythos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertrand Méheust&amp;rsquo;s discovery of parallels between UFO experience narratives and pre-1947 science fiction literature led to a study of the science fiction aspects of UFO mythology. Méheust found numerous parallels, including wondrous effects and humanoid motives. Michel Monnerie integrated Meheust&amp;rsquo;s study into his historical critique of UFO mythology. Michel Meurger expanded Meheust&amp;rsquo;s thesis into a compendium of parallels. Jacques Vallee noted electromagnetic effects associated with UFOs in earlier fiction. Researchers have explored the cultural back-stories to various alien types, including Grays, insectoids, and reptoids. Other studies explore science fictional saucer esoterica along psychosocial and historical lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-saucer-rumor&#34;&gt;The Saucer Rumor &lt;a href=&#34;#the-saucer-rumor&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery of why flying saucers are the dominant shape in UFO reports was addressed by Martin Kottmeyer, who discovered that Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s initial sighting in 1947 was misinterpreted. Arnold&amp;rsquo;s description of the objects&amp;rsquo; motion, rather than their shape, led to the &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; label. This mistake shaped the UFO phenomenon for decades, influencing film imagery, saucer photography, UFO illustration, contactee tales, and abduction experiences. Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s findings, first reported in 1988, suggest a cultural origin for the flying saucer phenomenon. The principal counterargument is that flying saucers were seen before Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s story, but Kottmeyer argues that the dominance of the saucer shape after 1947 is the key issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34;&gt;Flaps of Flying Phantoms &lt;a href=&#34;#flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early researchers attempted to correlate UFO flaps with Mars&amp;rsquo; proximity, but these predictions failed. British researchers shifted focus to pre-1947 &amp;ldquo;waves,&amp;rdquo; examining social, religious, political, and scientific backgrounds. Roger Sandell&amp;rsquo;s work on a 1905 Welsh UFO outbreak revealed odd facets and high strangeness material. Nigel Watson reported on a 1909 panic involving German airships spying on Britain. Phantom airship flaps were catalogued from various locations, involving cigar-shaped craft and rumors of foreign spies. By the 1930s, phantom airships were replaced by phantom aeroplanes. Researchers have experimented with variations in these explanations, such as the 1905 Wales flap occurring during a time of social change. Researchers generally reject explanations involving mass hysteria, preferring to discuss flaps as collective delusions maintained by rumor and gossip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-modern-myth-of-jung&#34;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Modern Myth&lt;/em&gt; of Jung &lt;a href=&#34;#the-modern-myth-of-jung&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Gustav Jung&amp;rsquo;s essay &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&lt;/em&gt; is considered a foundational work for the PSH. Jung&amp;rsquo;s use of synchronicity has also led some to see him as a proponent of paranormal explanations. While Jung acknowledged the possibility of some UFOs being physical objects, he clarified that he was uncommitted on the issue of their reality. He expressed concern that news affirming the existence of UFOs was more welcome than skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

It contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) and is favored by UFO researchers in the UK and France. Proponents view UFOs as an interesting subject for study, even with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bertrand Méheust&amp;rsquo;s study of science fiction parallels to UFO mythology revealed numerous similarities between UFO experience narratives and pre-1947 science fiction literature. These parallels include wondrous effects like invisible force-fields, teleportation, and engine-stopping rays, as well as humanoid motives for visiting Earth. Michel Monnerie integrated Meheust&amp;rsquo;s study into his historical critique of UFO mythology. Michel Meurger expanded Meheust&amp;rsquo;s thesis with a compendium of parallels.

&lt;p&gt;The psychosocial approach helped solve the mystery of why flying saucers are the dominant shape in UFO reports. Martin Kottmeyer discovered that the &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; label originated from a misinterpretation of Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting. Arnold described the objects&amp;rsquo; motion as erratic, &amp;ldquo;like a saucer if you skip it across the water,&amp;rdquo; but the reporter misinterpreted this as describing the objects&amp;rsquo; shape. This mistake shaped the UFO phenomenon for decades, influencing film imagery, saucer photography, UFO illustration, contactee tales, and abduction experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34;&gt;Flaps of Flying Phantoms &lt;a href=&#34;#flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early researchers attempted to correlate UFO flaps with Mars&amp;rsquo; proximity, but these predictions failed. British researchers shifted focus to pre-1947 &amp;ldquo;waves,&amp;rdquo; examining social, religious, political, and scientific backgrounds. Nigel Watson researched a March–May 1909 panic involving German airships spying on Britain. Phantom airship flaps were cataloged in various locations, often accompanied by rumors of foreign spies. By the 1930s, phantom airships were replaced by phantom aeroplanes.

&lt;p&gt;Carl Gustav Jung&amp;rsquo;s essay &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&lt;/em&gt; is considered a foundational work of the PSH. While some argue that Jung also considered the ETH, Jung himself refuted claims that he believed UFOs were physically real. He emphasized the psychological significance of the UFO phenomenon, regardless of its objective reality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien invasion, also known as space invasion, is a prevalent theme in science fiction stories and films. It involves extraterrestrial lifeforms invading Earth with various motives, such as exterminating or enslaving humanity, harvesting humans for food, stealing resources, or destroying the planet. This theme is a subgenre of invasion literature, popularized by H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, and is a type of first contact science fiction. Experts consider an actual alien invasion unlikely due to the immense costs involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the origins of the alien invasion theme in fiction. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; (1898) is considered the seminal alien invasion story, establishing themes like first contact and interplanetary war. However, earlier stories exist, such as Robert Potter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Germ Growers&lt;/em&gt; (1892), which features a covert alien invasion. The section also mentions Wells&amp;rsquo; proposed guerrilla war scenario in &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. Garrett P. Serviss&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt;, an unauthorized sequel to &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, depicts Thomas Edison leading a counterattack on Mars. The reprinting of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; in the United States in 1927 coincided with the Golden Age of Science Fiction. John W. Campbell and other science fiction writers, including Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Clifford D. Simak, and Robert A. Heinlein, further developed the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;variations&#34;&gt;Variations &lt;a href=&#34;#variations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores different variations of the alien invasion theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-infiltration&#34;&gt;Alien Infiltration &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-infiltration&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation involves invaders taking human form and infiltrating society, even taking control of command positions. Their goal may be to take over the world or prepare for a full-scale invasion. This theme reflects Cold War fears of communist infiltration. The Reptilian conspiracy theory is mentioned as a real-world belief in covert alien infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beneficial-alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Beneficial Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#beneficial-alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation presents aliens colonizing Earth to &amp;ldquo;civilize&amp;rdquo; humanity or secretly aiding humans to prevent self-destruction. Henry Slesar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Delegate from Venus&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned. Examples include Klaatu and Gort in &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;, Gene Roddenberry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Questor Tapes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; episode &amp;ldquo;Assignment: Earth&amp;rdquo;, Arthur C. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crest of the Stars&lt;/em&gt;, the film &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;, and David Brin&amp;rsquo;s Uplift Universe series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;invasion-by-humans&#34;&gt;Invasion by Humans &lt;a href=&#34;#invasion-by-humans&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation reverses the roles, with humans invading or attacking extraterrestrial lifeforms. Examples include the short story &lt;em&gt;Sentry&lt;/em&gt;, the video game &lt;em&gt;Phantasy Star II&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Martian Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; by Ray Bradbury, the Imperium of Man in the &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/em&gt; universe, &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Earth&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Silverberg, &lt;em&gt;Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game&lt;/em&gt; by Orson Scott Card, and the movies &lt;em&gt;Battle for Terra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Planet 51&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feasibility&#34;&gt;Feasibility &lt;a href=&#34;#feasibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the feasibility of an actual alien invasion. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute believes it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely due to resource availability and the likelihood of initial contact being through robots. David Morrison of NASA-Ames Research Center suggests first contact would be via radio communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;malmstrom-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Malmstrom UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#malmstrom-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the alleged Malmstrom UFO incident, focusing on claims that a UFO sighting was connected to a weapons failure at a nuclear missile complex in Montana in 1967. It presents claims made by retired Air Force personnel, skeptical counterarguments, and the incident&amp;rsquo;s coverage in media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1967-missile-complex-malfunction&#34;&gt;1967 Missile Complex Malfunction &lt;a href=&#34;#1967-missile-complex-malfunction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the 1967 incident at the Echo Flight missile complex, located between Hilger and Winifred, Montana, and operated by personnel from Malmstrom Air Force Base. On March 16, 1967, all sites in Echo Flight experienced a shutdown with &amp;ldquo;No-Go&amp;rdquo; indications, causing all launch facilities to lose strategic alert nearly simultaneously. An Air Force report mentioned rumors of UFOs around the area but stated they were disproven. A Mobile Strike Team reported no unusual activity or sightings. The malfunction, termed the &amp;ldquo;Echo Flight Incident,&amp;rdquo; was resolved within a day by maintenance crews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;public-claims-by-robert-salas&#34;&gt;Public Claims by Robert Salas &lt;a href=&#34;#public-claims-by-robert-salas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the claims made by Robert Salas, a 26-year-old Air Force Lieutenant at the time of the 1967 malfunction. In a 1996 Great Falls Tribune article, Salas recounted how a security guard reported flying objects performing strange maneuvers and a glowing red object hovering above the front gate. Shortly after, the complex&amp;rsquo;s ten Minuteman nuclear missiles went offline. Salas emphasized he was not a &amp;ldquo;UFO junkie&amp;rdquo; and sought answers to the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;promotion-in-media&#34;&gt;Promotion in Media &lt;a href=&#34;#promotion-in-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the media coverage of the Malmstrom UFO incident. It notes coverage in regional papers starting in 2000, including the Missoula Independent in 2001 and 2002. Air Force documents related to the incident were released under the Freedom of Information Act. Robert Salas authored &lt;em&gt;Faded Giant&lt;/em&gt; in 2005, speculating about a government cover-up to exploit extraterrestrial technology. In 2008, UFO author Robert Hastings discussed the incident in his book &lt;em&gt;UFOs and Nukes&lt;/em&gt;, which Salas defended. Salas appeared at the National Press Club in 2010 with other UFO speakers and authored &lt;em&gt;Unidentified: The UFO Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; in 2014 and &lt;em&gt;UAPs and the Nuclear Puzzle&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. The Great Falls Tribune marked the event&amp;rsquo;s 50th anniversary in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skeptical-views&#34;&gt;Skeptical Views &lt;a href=&#34;#skeptical-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents skeptical perspectives on the Malmstrom UFO incident. Science writer Mick West argues that the military investigated the incident and found no connection to UFO sightings, attributing the story&amp;rsquo;s persistence to Salas&amp;rsquo;s promotional efforts. Brian Dunning points out discrepancies between Salas&amp;rsquo;s memories and records from the 341st Strategic Missile Wing, suggesting the missile restart was due to a commonplace power failure and unrelated to later UFO reports. Michael Shermer, appearing with Salas on CNN, suggested that people can be unreliable observers and that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Robert Sheaffer suggests the UFO sighting was likely Mars and unrelated to the missile malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;UFO Legend Caused by 1947 Balloon Crash: Roswell Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident is a cornerstone of UFO lore, stemming from the recovery of debris near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Initially reported as a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; capture, the U.S. Army quickly retracted the statement, claiming it was a weather balloon. This event, coupled with subsequent government explanations and retractions, fueled decades of conspiracy theories alleging a cover-up of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1947-military-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;1947 Military Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#1947-military-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial event and its immediate aftermath. In 1947, rancher W.W. &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Brazel discovered debris on his property near Corona, New Mexico. The debris consisted of tinfoil, rubber, tape, and wooden beams. Unaware of the ongoing &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze,&amp;rdquo; Brazel initially didn&amp;rsquo;t connect the debris to UFOs. However, after visiting Corona, his uncle suggested it could be from a &amp;ldquo;flying disk.&amp;rdquo; Brazel reported the findings to Sheriff George Wilcox, who contacted Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAAF sent Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt to investigate. A press release issued by public information officer Walter Haut announced the military&amp;rsquo;s recovery of a &amp;ldquo;flying disc.&amp;rdquo; This announcement made international headlines but was quickly retracted. General Roger Ramey and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as a weather balloon at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the period between the initial incident and the rise of modern Roswell conspiracy theories. The Roswell debris retrieval faded from public attention for three decades. However, belief in government UFO cover-ups grew, fueled by hoaxes and legends of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico. The Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax introduced the idea of recovered alien bodies, which later became associated with Roswell. The concept of &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18,&amp;rdquo; a fictional location at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, emerged as a storage site for alien craft and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34;&gt;Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994) &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the resurgence of interest in Roswell and the development of modern conspiracy theories. In 1978, ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, who stated that the &amp;ldquo;weather balloon&amp;rdquo; explanation was a cover story and that he believed the debris was extraterrestrial. This interview, along with subsequent media attention, reignited interest in the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980 book &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore popularized Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account and added the claim of alien bodies found on the Plains of San Agustin. The book also connected Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account to Lydia Sleppy, a former teletype operator who claimed she was ordered to stop transmitting a story about crashed saucer wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Majestic 12 hoax, involving faked government documents, emerged in the 1980s, further fueling conspiracy theories. Glenn Dennis, a former mortician, provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses, which was endorsed by prominent Roswell ufologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing accounts of the Roswell incident led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. &lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt added testimony from new witnesses. &lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt; by Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner introduced the idea of two crashed saucers and eight aliens. &lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; by Randle and Schmitt proposed a new crash site and a different group of archaeologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-response&#34;&gt;Air Force Response &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the official government response to the growing Roswell conspiracy theories. Under pressure from New Mexico congressman Steven Schiff and the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Air Force published reports in the mid-1990s. The initial 1994 report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul, a military surveillance program. The 1995 report, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&lt;/em&gt;, supported this with documentation that narrowed the cause of the debris to a specific Mogul balloon train. The 1997 report, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;, detailed how eyewitness accounts of military personnel loading aliens into &amp;ldquo;body bags&amp;rdquo; matched the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s procedures for retrieving parachute test dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34;&gt;Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present) &lt;a href=&#34;#later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the continued development of Roswell theories and hoaxes in recent decades. &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, a pseudo-documentary, played a major role in shaping popular opinion of Roswell. The film centered around Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s hoaxed footage of an alien autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, retired army intelligence officer Philip J. Corso released &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, alleging that he was shown a nonhuman body and helped oversee a project to reverse engineer recovered crash debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other theories include Annie Jacobsen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Area 51: An Uncensored History of America&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Military Base&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a claim that Nazi doctor Josef Mengele was recruited by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce &amp;ldquo;grotesque, child-size aviators.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the explanations for the Roswell incident, focusing on Project Mogul and anthropomorphic dummies. The Air Force reports identified Project Mogul as the source of the 1947 debris and concluded that other alien crash accounts were likely misidentified military programs or accidents. The 1997 Air Force report concluded that the alleged &amp;ldquo;bodies&amp;rdquo; reported by later eyewitnesses came from memories of accidents involving military casualties and memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-impact&#34;&gt;Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the impact of the Roswell incident on tourism, commercialization, and popular fiction. Roswell&amp;rsquo;s tourism industry is based on ufology museums and businesses, as well as alien-themed iconography. A yearly UFO festival has been held since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident has been depicted in numerous films and television shows, including &lt;em&gt;Hangar 18&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widespread speculation of a cover-up led to United States presidents being questioned about the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;roswell-incident&#34;&gt;Roswell Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident refers to the events surrounding the crash of a military balloon near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. This event later became the basis for widespread conspiracy theories alleging the recovery of an extraterrestrial spacecraft by the United States military. The article explores the initial event, the subsequent development of UFO conspiracy theories, and the official explanations provided by the United States Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;UFO Legend Caused by 1947 Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the Roswell incident, highlighting the initial newspaper headline that reported the &amp;ldquo;capture&amp;rdquo; of a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; by the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). It sets the stage for the timeline of events, which occurred between June 4 and July 10, 1947, in Lincoln County, New Mexico. The section also mentions the &amp;ldquo;1947 flying disc craze&amp;rdquo; and lists related events such as the Kenneth Arnold sighting, the Flight 105 sighting, and various hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-balloon-debris-recovered-in-1947&#34;&gt;Military Balloon Debris Recovered in 1947 &lt;a href=&#34;#military-balloon-debris-recovered-in-1947&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial event, explaining that military balloon debris was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. It clarifies that this debris later became the basis for conspiracy theories about a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft. The balloon was part of the top-secret Project Mogul, operated from Alamogordo Army Air Field, designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. The United States Army initially announced the possession of a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; but retracted the statement within a day, attributing the debris to a conventional weather balloon to obscure the true purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1947-military-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;1947 Military Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#1947-military-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the Roswell incident. It explains that by 1947, the United States had launched thousands of top-secret Project Mogul balloons to listen for Soviet atomic tests. On June 4, researchers at Alamogordo Army Air Field in New Mexico launched a long train of these balloons, which they lost contact with near Corona, New Mexico, where W.W. &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Brazel&amp;rsquo;s ranch was located. Brazel discovered tinfoil, rubber, tape, and thin wooden beams scattered across his ranch later that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazel, initially unaware of the &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze,&amp;rdquo; visited Corona on July 5, where his uncle suggested the debris could be from a &amp;ldquo;flying disk.&amp;rdquo; The next day, Brazel informed Sheriff George Wilcox of his discovery, who then contacted Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt were assigned to gather the material. On July 8, RAAF public information officer Walter Haut issued a press release stating that the military had recovered a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; near Roswell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also describes the press conference where General Roger Ramey, Colonel Thomas DuBose, and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as pieces of a weather balloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explains that the 1947 debris retrieval remained relatively obscure for three decades. Reporting ceased after the government provided a mundane explanation, and broader reporting on flying saucers declined rapidly after the Twin Falls saucer hoax. Despite this, belief in UFO cover-ups by the US government became widespread. Hoaxes, legends, and stories of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico emerged that later formed elements of the Roswell myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34;&gt;Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax in 1948, which introduced stories of recovered alien bodies that later became associated with Roswell. The hoax narrative included small grey humanoid bodies, metal stronger than any found on Earth, indecipherable writing, and a government coverup to prevent public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hangar-18&#34;&gt;Hangar 18 &lt;a href=&#34;#hangar-18&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18,&amp;rdquo; a non-existent location that many later conspiracy theories allege housed extraterrestrial craft or bodies recovered from Roswell. The idea of alien corpses from a crashed ship being stored in an Air Force morgue at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was mentioned in Scully&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Behind the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;, expanded in the 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Incident at Exeter&lt;/em&gt;, and became the basis for a 1968 science-fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Fortec Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34;&gt;Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994) &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the rekindling of interest in Roswell after ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel in 1978. Marcel stated that the &amp;ldquo;weather balloon&amp;rdquo; explanation from the press conference was a cover story and that he now believed the debris was extraterrestrial. The tabloid &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; brought large-scale attention to the Marcel story the following February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the first Roswell conspiracy book, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore, released in October 1980. The book argues that an extraterrestrial craft was flying over the New Mexico desert to observe nuclear weapons activity when a lightning strike killed the alien crew. It alleges that, after recovering the crashed alien technology, the US government engaged in a cover-up to prevent mass panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;majestic-12-hoax&#34;&gt;Majestic 12 Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#majestic-12-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Majestic 12, the purported organization behind faked government documents delivered anonymously to multiple ufologists in the 1980s. The anonymously delivered documents detailed the creation of a likely fictitious Majestic 12 group formed to handle Roswell debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;role-of-glenn-dennis&#34;&gt;Role of Glenn Dennis &lt;a href=&#34;#role-of-glenn-dennis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces Glenn Dennis, a former mortician who provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses endorsed by prominent Roswell ufologists. Dennis claimed to have received calls from the Air Base with questions about body preservation and inquiries about small or hermetically sealed caskets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;competing-accounts-and-schism&#34;&gt;Competing Accounts and Schism &lt;a href=&#34;#competing-accounts-and-schism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains that a proliferation of competing Roswell accounts led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. The two leading UFO societies disagreed on the scenarios presented by Randle–Schmitt and Friedman–Berliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1991. The book claimed that General Arthur Exon had been aware of debris and bodies, and it included Glenn Dennis&amp;rsquo;s claims of an alien autopsy and Grady Barnett&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;alien body&amp;rdquo; accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crash-at-corona&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#crash-at-corona&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Stanton Friedman&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored with Don Berliner, released in 1992. The book introduced new &amp;ldquo;witnesses&amp;rdquo; and added to the narrative by doubling the number of flying saucers to two, and the number of aliens to eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Randle and Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s 1994 book, &lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed a cargo plane delivered alien bodies to Dwight D. Eisenhower. The book abandoned the Barnett crash site on the Plains of San Agustin and proposed a new crash site 35 miles north of Roswell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-response&#34;&gt;Air Force Response &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s official responses to Roswell conspiracy theories during the mid-1990s. The initial 1994 USAF report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul, a military surveillance program. The following year, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&lt;/em&gt; supported this with extensive documentation that narrowed the cause of the debris to a specific Mogul balloon train launched on June 4, 1947, and lost near the Roswell debris field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34;&gt;Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present) &lt;a href=&#34;#later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses later theories and hoaxes related to the Roswell incident, including the &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; film and Philip J. Corso&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-autopsy&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the pseudo-documentary &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to have footage of an alien autopsy filmed after the 1947 Roswell crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-after-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-day-after-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Philip J. Corso&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, released in 1997. Corso alleged that he was shown a purportedly nonhuman body suspended in liquid inside a glass coffin and that he helped oversee a project to reverse engineer recovered crash debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;related-debunked-or-fringe-theories&#34;&gt;Related Debunked or Fringe Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#related-debunked-or-fringe-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions related debunked or fringe theories, including Annie Jacobsen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Area 51: An Uncensored History of America&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Military Base&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a claim that Nazi doctor Josef Mengele was recruited by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce &amp;ldquo;grotesque, child-size aviators&amp;rdquo; to cause hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides explanations for the Roswell incident, stating that secrecy around the 1947 debris recovery was due to Cold War military programs rather than aliens. It notes that UFO believers maintain that a spacecraft crashed near Roswell, and &amp;ldquo;Roswell&amp;rdquo; remains synonymous with UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-mogul&#34;&gt;Project Mogul &lt;a href=&#34;#project-mogul&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section identifies the crashed object from the 1947 incident as a Project Mogul device. Mogul was a military surveillance program employing high-altitude balloons to monitor nuclear tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthropomorphic-dummies&#34;&gt;Anthropomorphic Dummies &lt;a href=&#34;#anthropomorphic-dummies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains that the 1947 Roswell accounts did not mention alien bodies. The 1997 Air Force report concluded that the alleged &amp;ldquo;bodies&amp;rdquo; reported by later eyewitnesses came&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;calvine-ufo-photograph&#34;&gt;Calvine UFO photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#calvine-ufo-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Calvine UFO photograph, also known as the Calvine Sighting, refers to a reported UFO sighting near Calvine, Perthshire, Scotland, in August 1990. Two men reported witnessing a diamond-shaped craft while walking on the moors. They took photographs of the object as it hovered silently before ascending vertically and disappearing. The &lt;em&gt;Daily Record&lt;/em&gt; newspaper received the story and the original prints and negatives, which were then passed to the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The original materials disappeared, and the story was never published. Investigative journalist David Clarke has led efforts to locate the witnesses. The case gained public interest over the years, with partial documentation released by The National Archives in 2009. An original photograph was discovered by Clarke and published in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; in 2022, leading to significant media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-background&#34;&gt;Historical background &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Calvine sighting within the broader history of UFO photography. It mentions Nick Pope, a former Ministry of Defence desk officer, who included the Calvine sighting in his 1996 book, &lt;em&gt;Open Skies, Closed Minds&lt;/em&gt;. Pope described the sighting as intriguing and noted that the MOD&amp;rsquo;s analysis concluded the photos were likely genuine. The object was described as a solid craft, at least the size of a Harrier or Hawk fighter jet. Sean Kirkpatrick, former director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has suggested the image is a reflection and may have been doctored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-mod-files&#34;&gt;Release of MOD files &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-mod-files&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details how the Calvine case gained more public attention after 2008 when the National Archives began releasing MOD UFO reports. David Clarke supervised the release and publication of these files. Among the released documents were materials related to the Calvine sighting, including a government briefing and handwritten summary. Two poor-quality photocopies of images were also included. These files revealed that DI55, a branch of the Directorate of Scientific and Technical Intelligence (DSTI), investigated the images along with a RAF photo analyst agency. Clarke later explored the Calvine incident in his book, &lt;em&gt;The UFO Files&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2015-channel-5-documentary&#34;&gt;2015 Channel 5 documentary &lt;a href=&#34;#2015-channel-5-documentary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of information from the National Archives, along with publicity from Clarke and Pope, led to increasing public interest in the case. In 2015, the incident was featured in the Channel 5 documentary series &lt;em&gt;Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;. The episode, titled &amp;ldquo;Alien Cover-Up&amp;rdquo;, included interviews with Clarke and Pope and featured a reconstruction of the sighting. A graphic artist recreated the Calvine photograph for the program, which was later mistaken by some for a genuine image. Pope has speculated on potential links to the alleged Aurora project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery-of-the-calvine-photograph&#34;&gt;Discovery of the Calvine photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#discovery-of-the-calvine-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the renewed investigation led by David Clarke in 2018 to locate the missing photographs and witnesses. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s interest was sparked by a Defence Intelligence Officer&amp;rsquo;s claim that the witnesses had photographed a classified U.S. black project platform. Clarke and his team interviewed former MOD staff and conducted public searches. In 2020, Scottish UFOlogist Straiph Wilson launched a search for the hill walkers. Clarke eventually tracked down retired RAF Press Officer Craig Lindsay, who had kept the original photograph for over 32 years. Lindsay donated the print and other items to Sheffield Hallam University&amp;rsquo;s Special Collection. Andrew Robinson, a photographic specialist, produced high-resolution digital copies and conducted an in-depth analysis, concluding that the photograph is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-search-for-kevin-russell&#34;&gt;The search for Kevin Russell &lt;a href=&#34;#the-search-for-kevin-russell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for a person named Kevin Russell, whose name was written on the back of the original Calvine photograph. The name was believed to be that of one of the witnesses. Despite contacting over 400 people with that name, Clarke&amp;rsquo;s team was unable to identify the witness. A person named Kevin Russell who worked at a hotel in Pitlochry was identified, but he denied any knowledge of the UFO. Nick Pope acknowledges being aware of the name Kevin Russell but declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-program-documentary-2024&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Program&lt;/em&gt; documentary (2024) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-program-documentary-2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the documentary &lt;em&gt;The Program&lt;/em&gt; by James Fox, released in December 2024, which features the Calvine UFO case. Fox interviewed David Clarke and Robinson in Sheffield and Lindsay in Scotland. The film explores the U.S. congressional effort to uncover government knowledge about UFOs and UAPs and includes an in-depth review of the Calvine case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unidentified flying object</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_22d9c5f39019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 02:55:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; were initially used to describe UFOs, stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass a broader range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged later, gaining traction in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and earthbound explanations for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs, upon investigation, are identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. Studies have shown that misidentification of prosaic phenomena, often due to inexperience or misperception, is a primary factor in UFO sightings. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that thorough investigation often reveals less mystery than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and atmospheric optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians typically offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes objects moving through the sky in ancient Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts from the 16th century depicting celestial phenomena over Nuremberg and Basel, which some connect to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A report in the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in 1878, where a farmer described seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; In 1946, the Swedish military collected over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, referred to as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with the media frenzy surrounding Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting near Mount Rainier. Arnold described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers,&amp;rdquo; sparking widespread public interest. Weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred, involving the recovery of debris from a downed observation balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs&amp;rdquo; emerged, and books like Donald Keyhoe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Flying Saucers Are Real&lt;/em&gt; popularized the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Media speculation intensified, particularly during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings. The Condon Report in 1968 concluded that further UFO studies were not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into popular culture, with alien abduction accounts like the Barney and Betty Hill incident gaining prominence. Films like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, along with TV series like &lt;em&gt;In Search of&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, fueled public fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention resurfaced with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream interest. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project, aiming to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government programs like NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were established to investigate UFO claims. Congressional hearings were held in 2022 and 2023, featuring whistleblower claims from former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls indicating that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable cases and incidents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rendlesham Forest incident (1980).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; The Valensole UFO incident (1965) and the Trans-en-Provence Case (1981).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kecksburg UFO incident (1965), the Travis Walton abduction claim (1975), and the Phoenix Lights (1997).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous hoaxes include the Maury Island incident and the Gulf Breeze UFO incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigations-of-reports&#34;&gt;Investigations of reports &lt;a href=&#34;#investigations-of-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO reports have been investigated by governments and academics in various countries. No official government investigation has definitively confirmed that UFOs are real, physical objects of extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known government studies include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil (1952–2016):&lt;/strong&gt; The National Archives of Brazil has been receiving documentation from the Brazilian Air Force regarding UFO investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chile (c. 1968):&lt;/strong&gt; The SEFAA (previously CEFAA) receives case reports from the public, civil aviators, and the Chilean Air Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada (c. 1950):&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of National Defence has investigated UFO reports, including the Falcon Lake incident and the Shag Harbour UFO incident. Early studies included Project Magnet and Project Second Storey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. investigations include Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, the CIA&amp;rsquo;s Directorate of Science &amp;amp; Technology study, the Robertson Panel, the Brookings Report, the Condon Committee, the RAND Corporation study, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Sturrock panel, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;usaaf-and-fbi-response-to-the-1947-sightings&#34;&gt;USAAF and FBI response to the 1947 sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#usaaf-and-fbi-response-to-the-1947-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;usaf&#34;&gt;USAF &lt;a href=&#34;#usaf&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;projects-sign-19471949-grudge-19481951-and-blue-book-19511970&#34;&gt;Projects Sign (1947–1949), Grudge (1948–1951), and Blue Book (1951–1970) &lt;a href=&#34;#projects-sign-19471949-grudge-19481951-and-blue-book-19511970&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s final report stated that there was not enough data to determine the origin of some UFOs. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate concluding an extraterrestrial origin, but the Air Force Chief of Staff ordered it destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classified U.S. study by the CIA in 1952 concluded that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge, which was later reorganized as Project Blue Book. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, became critical of the program&amp;rsquo;s scientific rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;usaf-regulation-200-2-19531954&#34;&gt;USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953–1954) &lt;a href=&#34;#usaf-regulation-200-2-19531954&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force Regulation 200-2 defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and outlined procedures for investigation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;blue-book-and-the-condon-committee-19681970&#34;&gt;Blue Book and the Condon Committee (1968–1970) &lt;a href=&#34;#blue-book-and-the-condon-committee-19681970&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Report in 1968 arrived at a negative conclusion regarding UFOs. Project Blue Book closed down in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien Nation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_eed570f8ae8c/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 03:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_eed570f8ae8c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-nation&#34;&gt;Alien Nation &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-nation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A science fiction police procedural television series that aired on Fox from 1989 to 1990. It&amp;rsquo;s based on the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series is set in the near future, beginning in 1990, after a flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert. The ship contains the Tenctonese, a race of extraterrestrials escaping slavery. They are accepted as immigrants to the US, and the series explores their integration into American society. Storylines often address themes of racism and bigotry, using the Newcomers as a stand-in for discriminated minorities. The series uses social commentary to illustrate what it means to be human and the often bizarre rituals we observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detective Matthew &amp;ldquo;Matt&amp;rdquo; Sikes:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Gary Graham, a human detective partnered with George Francisco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detective George Francisco:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Eric Pierpoint, a Newcomer detective partnered with Matthew Sikes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susan Francisco:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Michele Scarabelli, George&amp;rsquo;s wife, a Newcomer advertising businesswoman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Francisco:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Lauren Woodland, George and Susan&amp;rsquo;s young daughter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buck Francisco:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Sean Six, George and Susan&amp;rsquo;s initially delinquent teenage son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cathy Frankel:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Terri Treas, Matt&amp;rsquo;s Newcomer neighbor and on-off girlfriend, a bio-chemist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert Einstein:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Jeff Marcus, a timid Newcomer janitor working at the police department.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cpt. Bryon Grazer:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Ron Fassler, Matt and George&amp;rsquo;s human superior officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beatrice Zepeda:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Jenny Gago, a human detective in Matt and George&amp;rsquo;s squad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burns:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Jeff Doucette, a human photographer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sergeant Dobbs:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, a human police officer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncle Moodri:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by James Greene, an eccentric but wise Newcomer and member of the Francisco family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Johnson, responsible for other science-fiction television series, was approached for the television adaptation of the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;. He initially had no interest in the project but was later inspired to create a series focusing on social commentary about the integration of a new minority group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;changes-from-the-film&#34;&gt;Changes from the film &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-from-the-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several changes were made from the original film. The human detective Matthew Sykes was played by James Caan in the film, but Gary Graham in the TV series. Detective George Francisco was played by Mandy Patinkin in the film, but Eric Pierpoint in the TV series. The TV series explores Newcomer culture more deeply than the film. Francisco&amp;rsquo;s family also differs, with a daughter, Emily, added to the TV series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancellation&#34;&gt;Cancellation &lt;a href=&#34;#cancellation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series ran for one season on Fox. Despite building a strong fan base, the show was cancelled due to the network&amp;rsquo;s financial difficulties. The season ended on a cliffhanger, and popular demand led to the unproduced second season premiere being adapted as a novel and comic book. Years later, Fox produced five television films to continue the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episodes&#34;&gt;Episodes &lt;a href=&#34;#episodes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series consists of 22 episodes, each dealing with the integration of the Newcomers into human society and the challenges they face. The episodes often involve police procedural elements, with Sikes and Francisco investigating crimes involving both humans and Newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television-films&#34;&gt;Television films &lt;a href=&#34;#television-films&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five television films continued the story after the series&amp;rsquo; cancellation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; (1994)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt; (1995)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: The Udara Legacy&lt;/em&gt; (1997)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete series was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox in 2006. The five television films were later released as a collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revival&#34;&gt;Revival &lt;a href=&#34;#revival&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Syfy announced a new take on the series with Tim Minear writing. However, the series was later cancelled. In 2015, a remake was reported to be in the works with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing the script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_d171825cd54d/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-the-nation-of-argentina&#34;&gt;List of alleged UFO sightings in the nation of Argentina &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-the-nation-of-argentina&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents a compilation of reported UFO sightings in Argentina, spanning from 1962 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;may-1962&#34;&gt;May 1962 &lt;a href=&#34;#may-1962&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details several UFO sightings that occurred in May 1962, primarily around Bahía Blanca. Key events include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sightings at the Espora Air Base on May 11 and 18.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An encounter on Route 35 where three truck drivers witnessed an illuminated object rising from a field and dividing into two parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A photograph taken by Miguel Tohmé in Bahía Blanca on May 21, depicting a UFO &amp;ldquo;the size of a soccer ball.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sightings at the Port Belgrano Naval Base between May 21 and 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;16-july-1965&#34;&gt;16 July 1965 &lt;a href=&#34;#16-july-1965&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a sighting in Buenos Aires on July 16, 1965, where two bright disks were observed remaining stationary before flying away at high speed. The Seventh Air Brigade dispatched three Gloster Meteor aircraft from Morón Air Base to investigate, but the search yielded no results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-december-1965&#34;&gt;1 December 1965 &lt;a href=&#34;#1-december-1965&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section refers to the Adhara Observatory UFO Lunar Transit. On December 1, 1965, at 8:30 pm, the Adhara Observatory in San Miguel, Buenos Aires province, received calls about strange objects visible on the moon. Photographs taken by the observatory staff revealed disk-shaped objects flying in front of the moon. Some experts suggest these objects may have been caused by film processing errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;27-october-1973&#34;&gt;27 October 1973 &lt;a href=&#34;#27-october-1973&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts the experience of truck driver Dionisio Llanca, who was admitted to the Municipal Hospital of Bahía Blanca on October 30. Llanca claimed that on October 27, he encountered an intense light while changing a tire on his way to Río Gallegos, which paralyzed him. He reported seeing an object in the sky and beings who subjected him to medical testing. He awoke hours later approximately 9 kilometers away. UFO researcher Fabio Zerpa investigated the case and published it in his book &lt;em&gt;El Reino Subterráneo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-january-1986&#34;&gt;9 January 1986 &lt;a href=&#34;#9-january-1986&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses an alleged UFO landing on Mount Pajarillo, near Capilla del Monte. An 11-year-old local child, Gabriel Gomez, witnessed the event. The following day, a circular footprint, known as “Huella del Pajarillo,” appeared near Cerro Uritorco, believed to be the result of a UFO landing that burned the area in a circular shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;25-december-1988&#34;&gt;25 December 1988 &lt;a href=&#34;#25-december-1988&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a sighting over Villa Urquiza, Buenos Aires, where a silver UFO flew over the high-density area. This event is considered one of Argentina&amp;rsquo;s most spectacular UFO incidents, with over 7,500 witnesses. The local airport reported an object flying west towards General Paz Avenue, detected on radar on that sunny afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-september-2023&#34;&gt;5 September 2023 &lt;a href=&#34;#5-september-2023&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details an incident at the Espora Air Base near Bahía Blanca. On that night, four black, triangular UFOs allegedly flew over the base and were engaged with gunfire by military personnel. One object reportedly fired a laser, injuring two or three soldiers. The Base denied the incident, claiming that videos and audios circulating were edited fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;close-encounter&#34;&gt;Close Encounter &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounter&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close encounter, in ufology, is defined as an event where a person witnesses an unidentified flying object (UFO) at close range, reducing the likelihood of misidentification. The term and classification system were introduced by astronomer and UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek in his 1972 book, &lt;em&gt;The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry&lt;/em&gt;. While others have expanded on Hynek&amp;rsquo;s original categories, these extensions haven&amp;rsquo;t gained widespread acceptance due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor. Sightings beyond 150 meters are generally classified as &lt;em&gt;daylight discs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nocturnal lights&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;radar/visual reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hyneks-scale&#34;&gt;Hynek&amp;rsquo;s Scale &lt;a href=&#34;#hyneks-scale&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek created a six-level classification system for UFO sightings, arranged by proximity. The categories include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nocturnal Lights:&lt;/strong&gt; Unexplained lights observed in the night sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daylight Discs:&lt;/strong&gt; UFOs seen during the day, typically disc-shaped or oval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radar-Visual:&lt;/strong&gt; UFO sightings confirmed by radar, intended to provide more concrete evidence, though atmospheric anomalies can sometimes explain radar propagation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Encounters of the First Kind (CE1):&lt;/strong&gt; Visual sightings of a UFO at close range (less than 150 meters), displaying appreciable angular extension and detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Encounters of the Second Kind (CE2):&lt;/strong&gt; UFO events involving physical effects, such as interference with vehicles or electronics, animal reactions, physiological effects on witnesses, or physical traces like ground impressions or scorched vegetation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind (CE3):&lt;/strong&gt; UFO encounters where animated entities are present, including humanoids, robots, or humans seemingly associated with the UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bloecher-subtypes&#34;&gt;Bloecher Subtypes &lt;a href=&#34;#bloecher-subtypes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Bloecher proposed six subtypes for Close Encounters of the Third Kind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aboard:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed only inside the UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed both inside and outside the UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed near a UFO, but not entering or exiting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed without any UFOs being seen, but UFO activity has been reported in the area around the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excluded:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed, but no UFOs are seen, and no UFO activity has been reported in the area at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequence:&lt;/strong&gt; No entity or UFOs are observed, but the subject experiences some form of &amp;ldquo;intelligent communication.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extensions-of-hyneks-scale&#34;&gt;Extensions of Hynek&amp;rsquo;s Scale &lt;a href=&#34;#extensions-of-hyneks-scale&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Hynek&amp;rsquo;s death in 1986, Jacques Vallee expanded the classification system by adding Close Encounters of the Fourth and Fifth Kinds, detailed in his 1990 book, &lt;em&gt;Confrontations: A Scientist&amp;rsquo;s Search for Alien Contact&lt;/em&gt;. These extensions were quickly adopted by the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-fourth-kind-ce4&#34;&gt;Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind (CE4) &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-fourth-kind-ce4&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CE4 involves a human being abducted by a UFO or its occupants. Jacques Vallée suggested that the &amp;ldquo;fourth kind&amp;rdquo; should encompass cases where witnesses experience a transformation of their sense of reality, including non-abduction events with absurd, hallucinatory, or dreamlike elements associated with UFO encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-fifth-kind-ce5&#34;&gt;Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (CE5) &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-fifth-kind-ce5&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vallee&amp;rsquo;s original definition, a CE5 occurs when an alien abductee experiences a physical effect from the encounter, such as injury or healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate interpretation, popularized by Steven M. Greer, defines CE5 as human-initiated contact with extraterrestrial life forms or advanced interstellar civilizations, involving direct communication between aliens and humans. This involves individuals or groups using specific protocols, primarily contact meditation and sounds or signals, to establish communication or interaction with extraterrestrial beings. This is also referred to as human-initiated close encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-sixth-kind-ce6&#34;&gt;Close Encounters of the Sixth Kind (CE6) &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-sixth-kind-ce6&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term describes a sexual encounter between a human and an extraterrestrial species.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flying saucer</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;flying-saucer&#34;&gt;Flying Saucer &lt;a href=&#34;#flying-saucer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flying saucer, or flying disc, is a purported type of disc-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO). The term originated in 1947 when US news media reported pilot Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s claim of seeing objects flying near his airplane over Washington State. The news reports included implausible speed estimates and preceded a wave of sightings across the US, including the Roswell incident and the Flight 105 UFO sighting. A National Guard pilot died in 1948 while pursuing a flying saucer. Civilian research groups and conspiracy theories developed around the topic, and the concept spread to other countries. Early reports speculated about secret military technology, but flying saucers became associated with aliens by 1950. The terms unidentified flying object (UFO) and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) have gradually replaced the term over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aerial photo taken over Lake Cote, Costa Rica, by Sergio Loaiza in 1971 is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science fiction, UFO sightings, UFO conspiracy theories, and popular culture, saucers are typically piloted by nonhuman beings. Most reported sightings describe saucers in the distance and do not mention a crew. Descriptions of the craft vary considerably. Early reports emphasized speed, but the descriptions shifted over the decades to the objects mostly hovering. They are generally said to be round, sometimes with a protrusion on top, but details of the shape vary between reports. Witnesses describe flying saucers as silent or deafening, with lights of every color, and flying alone or in formation. Size estimates range from small enough to fit in a living room to over 2,000 feet (610 m) in diameter. Sightings are most frequent at night. Astronomer Donald Howard Menzel concluded that the reports were too varied to all be describing the same type of objects. Experts have identified most reported saucers as known phenomena, including astronomical objects such as Venus, airborne objects such as balloons, and optical phenomena such as sun dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1950s pop culture embraced flying saucers. The discs appeared in film, television, literature, music, toys, and advertising. Their reports influenced religious movements and were the subject of military investigations. The shape became visual shorthand for alien invaders. During the 1960s, saucers waned in popularity as UFOs were reported and depicted in other shapes. Discs ceased to be viewed as the standard shape for alien spacecraft but are still often depicted, sometimes for their retro value to evoke the early Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of fantastical aircraft predate the first flying saucers. In antiquity, mysterious lights in the sky were interpreted as spiritual phenomena. In the 1800s, many newspapers reported massive airships with glowing lights and humming engines. These are often seen as precursors to flying saucer and UFO sightings. On January 25, 1878, the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, reported an object resembling a balloon flying &amp;ldquo;at wonderful speed&amp;rdquo;. The newspaper said it appeared to be about the size of a saucer from his perspective, one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO. An outbreak of a number of sightings of mystery airships occurred in America in 1896 and 1897. During World War II, Allied pilots reported balls of light following their planes. They named the lights foo fighters and believed they were advanced Axis aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of the typical flying saucer first appeared in science fiction. French sociologist Bertrand Méheust noted Jean de La Hire&amp;rsquo;s 1908 novel &lt;em&gt;La Roue fulgurante&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Lightning Wheel&lt;/em&gt;). In the novel, a flying disc-shaped machine abducts the protagonists via a beam of light. Science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&lt;/em&gt; began publishing &amp;ldquo;The Shaver Mystery&amp;rdquo; in 1945. Written by Richard Sharpe Shaver and edited by Raymond A. Palmer, they were science fiction tales about technologically advanced &amp;ldquo;detrimental robots&amp;rdquo; that abducted humans, but the stories were presented as a true account of Shaver&amp;rsquo;s life. Until the magazine ceased printing The Shaver Mystery, &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; letter column was regularly full of readers sharing their own purportedly true sightings of the robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the flying saucer was coined as a term, fantasy artwork in pulp magazines depicted flying discs. Skeptical physicist Milton Rothman noted the appearance of so-called flying saucers in the fantasy artwork of 1930s pulp science fiction magazines, by artists such as Frank R. Paul. One of Paul&amp;rsquo;s earliest depictions of a flying saucer appeared on the cover of the November 1929 issue of Hugo Gernsback&amp;rsquo;s pulp science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Science Wonder Stories&lt;/em&gt;. Science fiction illustrator Frank Wu wrote that the idea of space vehicles shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern flying saucer concept, including the association with aliens, can be traced to the 1947 Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. On June 24, 1947, businessman and amateur pilot Kenneth Arnold landed at the Yakima, Washington airstrip. He told staff and friends that he&amp;rsquo;d seen nine unusual airborne objects. Arnold estimated their speed at 1,700 miles per hour, beyond the capabilities of known aircraft. Newspapers soon contacted Arnold for interviews. The &lt;em&gt;East Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; reported his supposed aircraft as &amp;ldquo;saucer-like&amp;rdquo;. In a June 26 radio interview, Arnold described them as &amp;ldquo;something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear&amp;rdquo;. Headline writers coined the terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying disk&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;disc&amp;rdquo;) for the story. Arnold later told CBS News that the early coverage &amp;ldquo;did not quote me properly [&amp;hellip;] when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water. Most of the newspapers misunderstood and misquoted that, too. They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion.&amp;rdquo; The circular shape of typical flying saucers may be due to reporters mistaking Arnold&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;saucer-like&amp;rdquo; description of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold&amp;rsquo;s story preceded a wave of hundreds of flying saucer reports. Lieutenant Governor of Idaho Donald S. Whitehead claimed he saw a fast-moving object resembling a meteor around the time of Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. In early July, head of Air Materiel Command Nathan F. Twining told reporters that &amp;ldquo;anyone seeing the objects&amp;rdquo; should contact Wright Field. The next widely publicized report was the sighting by a United Airlines crew on July 4 of nine more disc-like objects pacing their plane over Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public was divided on the potential origin of the saucers. Arnold told military intelligence officers he suspected the discs were experimental aircraft, and early newspapers reported Arnold saying, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they were—unless they were guided missiles.&amp;rdquo; News media speculated on a Soviet origin, and many war veterans connected them to the foo fighters seen during World War II. A Gallup Poll found that 90% of Americans were aware of the saucer stories, and 16 percent believed they were secret military weapons, most likely American. The most common explanation given was some type of illusion or mirage. Less than one percent believed they were alien craft. One report from Seattle, Washington, described a hammer and sickle painted onto a flying disc. The stories spread to other countries, where they were influenced by local political and social concerns. In Europe, which was still recovering from the Second World War, saucers were often reported with rocket-like features. German newspapers reported flying saucers that exploded or had tails of fire. The names for the discs were largely derived from the English &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; including the French &lt;em&gt;soucoupe volante&lt;/em&gt;, Spanish &lt;em&gt;platillo volante&lt;/em&gt;, Portuguese &lt;em&gt;disco voador&lt;/em&gt;, Swedish &lt;em&gt;flygande tefat&lt;/em&gt;, German &lt;em&gt;fliegende Untertasse&lt;/em&gt;, and Italian &lt;em&gt;disco volante&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1947 sightings peaked in the days after the Fourth of July and declined rapidly through mid-July. Multiple organizations offered $1,000 rewards for hard proof. In the widely reported July 7, 1947, Twin Falls saucer hoax, four teenagers in Idaho fabricated a crashed disc from jukebox parts. On July 8, the Army Air Force base at Roswell, New Mexico, issued a press release saying that they had recovered a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; from a nearby ranch; the so-called Roswell UFO incident made front-page news. International media covered the military&amp;rsquo;s announcement of a crashed disc, but within 24 hours were reporting the military&amp;rsquo;s retraction and explanation that the material was balloon debris. By July 11, the most widely reported story was a North Hollywood resident&amp;rsquo;s claim that a 30-inch galvanized iron disc containing glass radio tubes had crashed in his garden. Newspapers quoted Fire Battalion Chief Wallace Newcombe&amp;rsquo;s assessment, &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look to me like it could fly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Air Force collected over a hundred reports at Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Air Force General Nathan Twining established Project SAUCER, later renamed Project Sign, the first in a series of UFO investigations by the US Government. Other national governments followed suit. Canada began Project Magnet and the United Kingdom launched the Flying Saucer Working Party in 1950, which attributed saucer reports to meteorological phenomena, astronomical phenomena, misidentification, optical illusions, misconceptions, or hoaxes&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;levelland-ufo-case&#34;&gt;Levelland UFO Case &lt;a href=&#34;#levelland-ufo-case&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levelland UFO case occurred on November 2–3, 1957, around Levelland, Texas. It is considered a notable UFO incident due to the number of witnesses. The US Air Force attributed the sightings to ball lightning or a severe electrical storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reports&#34;&gt;Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 2, 1957, Pedro Saucedo and Joe Salaz reported a UFO sighting to the Levelland police department, claiming their truck&amp;rsquo;s engine died when a blue flash of light and a rocket-shaped object approached. Motorist Jim Wheeler reported a large, egg-shaped object blocking the road, causing his vehicle to stall. A married couple reported a bright flash of light that caused their headlights and radio to fail temporarily. Texas Technological College student Newell Wright encountered a 100-foot-long egg-shaped object that caused his car engine to sputter and die. Farmer Frank Williams reported a glowing object that caused his car&amp;rsquo;s lights and motor to stop. Ronald Martin and James Long also reported similar encounters with a brightly lit object. Sheriff Weir Clem saw a red object moving across the sky, and Fire Chief Ray Jones experienced vehicle malfunctions. The Levelland police department received a total of 15 UFO-related reports during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-air-force-investigation&#34;&gt;U.S. Air Force Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#us-air-force-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levelland sightings were investigated by Project Blue Book. An Air Force sergeant spent seven hours investigating, interviewing Saucedo, Wheeler, and Wright. The Air Force concluded that a severe electrical storm, possibly ball lightning or St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire, caused the sightings and auto failures, blaming engine failures on wet electrical circuits. Donald H. Menzel agreed with the Air Force explanation, attributing the events to ball lightning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufologists&#34;&gt;Ufologists &lt;a href=&#34;#ufologists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James E. McDonald and J. Allen Hynek disputed the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation, arguing that there was no electrical storm. McDonald testified that ten vehicles were stopped independently within a short area and time. Hynek concurred initially but later recognized the lack of evidence that ball lightning could stop cars and put out headlights. Ufologists also noted that the Air Force investigator did not interview nine of the fifteen witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;time-traveler-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Time-traveler UFO hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#time-traveler-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time-traveler hypothesis, also known as chrononaut UFO, future humans, extratempestrial model, and Terminator theory, proposes that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are humans traveling from the future using advanced technology. This concept has gained recent attention from figures like retired NASA aerospace engineer Larry Lemke, Wisconsin congressman Mike Gallagher, and filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Mainstream scholars consider this hypothesis extremely implausible, and it&amp;rsquo;s generally viewed as unorthodox even among fringe conspiracy theorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;antecedents&#34;&gt;Antecedents &lt;a href=&#34;#antecedents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the origins of the ideas that led to the time-traveler UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins-of-time-travel-speculation&#34;&gt;Origins of time travel speculation &lt;a href=&#34;#origins-of-time-travel-speculation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection traces the concept of time travel from the future to the past back to its literary origins. Pierre Boitard&amp;rsquo;s 1861 book &lt;em&gt;Paris avant les hommes&lt;/em&gt; is credited with introducing the idea, featuring a man sent back to prehistoric Earth. Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s 1887 novel &lt;em&gt;Lumen&lt;/em&gt; also explored the theme of a soul traveling through different historical periods. The section also notes that while time travel is considered physically impossible by most, theoretical research continues to explore its potential feasibility, with scientists like J. Richard Gott and Ronald Mallet speculating on the possibility of future human time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;speculation-of-future-human-evolution&#34;&gt;Speculation of future human evolution &lt;a href=&#34;#speculation-of-future-human-evolution&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the history of speculation about the future evolution of mankind. It highlights H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt; as an early example of both time travel and speculative evolution. Other authors mentioned include Edgar Rice Burroughs, Olaf Stapledon, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Baxter, and Cevdet Mehmet Kösemen. The section also identifies climate change, the technological singularity, space travel, and genetic enhancement as potential factors that could alter human evolution, leading to transhuman and posthuman scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufos-and-initial-explanations&#34;&gt;UFOs and initial explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#ufos-and-initial-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection provides a brief overview of the history of UFO sightings. It mentions reports of unknown objects in the skies dating back to antiquity, as well as the mystery airship sightings of the 1890s and the Foo fighters and ghost rockets during World War II. The modern UFO era is said to have begun in the summer of 1947, following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. Initial explanations for these sightings ranged from novel US or Soviet technology to misidentification of mundane objects and mass hysteria. Fringe theories included extraterrestrial or interdimensional origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;formation-and-spread&#34;&gt;Formation and spread &lt;a href=&#34;#formation-and-spread&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the development and popularization of the time-traveler UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implausibility-of-humanoid-aliens&#34;&gt;Implausibility of humanoid aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#implausibility-of-humanoid-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection addresses the common depiction of aliens as humanoids in contactee and alien abduction folklore. It cites George Gaylord Simpson&amp;rsquo;s 1964 article &lt;em&gt;The Nonprevalence of Humanoids&lt;/em&gt;, which argues that it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely for extraterrestrial intelligence to exist and even more unlikely for it to be humanoid. The section also mentions Stephen Jay Gould&amp;rsquo;s thought experiment about rewinding evolution, suggesting that humans would likely not evolve again. Biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s view on the implausibility of Grey aliens evolving a physiology similar to humans is also included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-popularization&#34;&gt;Modern popularization &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-popularization&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the modern resurgence of the time-traveler hypothesis. It mentions Jacques Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1975 book &lt;em&gt;The Invisible College&lt;/em&gt; as an early example. Other figures and works mentioned include David S. Anderson, Jenny Randles, James Herbert Brennan, and Philip J. Corso and William J. Birnes&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, which reported Hermann Oberth&amp;rsquo;s belief that the Roswell craft could have been a time machine. The History channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt; is also mentioned for its episodes exploring the concept. Michael P. Masters&amp;rsquo; book &lt;em&gt;Identified Flying Objects&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Extratempestrial Model&lt;/em&gt; are highlighted for their in-depth exploration of the hypothesis. Tim Peake and Steven Spielberg are mentioned for their recent public comments on the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection lists examples of the time-traveler hypothesis in popular culture. It includes the TV series &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s About Time&lt;/em&gt;, Gregory Benford&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Timescape&lt;/em&gt;, David Drake&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Sphere&lt;/em&gt;, the TV film &lt;em&gt;Official Denial&lt;/em&gt;, the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Blake and Mortimer&lt;/em&gt;, the band Yes, Jordan Peele&amp;rsquo;s movie &lt;em&gt;Nope&lt;/em&gt;, and the movie &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terminology-and-connection-to-other-theories&#34;&gt;Terminology and connection to other theories &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology-and-connection-to-other-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection clarifies the terminology used to describe the hypothesis, noting that while Michael P. Masters uses the term &amp;ldquo;extratempestrial,&amp;rdquo; the overall idea is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;the time-traveler hypothesis.&amp;rdquo; It also discusses the overlap between the time-traveler hypothesis and the interdimensional hypothesis, with figures like John Ventre and Harold E. Puthoff using the terms interchangeably. The section also notes that the time-traveler hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for the absence of future time travelers, similar to how the extraterrestrial hypothesis addresses Fermi&amp;rsquo;s paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism &lt;a href=&#34;#criticism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents criticisms of the time-traveler hypothesis. It notes that the hypothesis is considered pseudoscientific. Neil deGrasse Tyson is quoted as calling the hypothesis illogical, and Robert Sheaffer criticizes Michael P. Masters&amp;rsquo; work for relying on the belief that time travel is possible. David J. Darling argues that the extraterrestrial and time-travel hypotheses are equally unlikely and unnecessary. Ian Ridpath suggests that Jim Penniston&amp;rsquo;s claims about time-traveling UFOs may have been influenced by the film &lt;em&gt;Official Denial&lt;/em&gt;. Isaac Arthur is mentioned for debunking the concept as presented in &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. Fabio Costa is quoted as saying that time travel requires two doors, one in the future and one in the past, raising the question of where the time machine is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as spacecraft or probes from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature. It notes that the term gained traction in the latter half of the 1960s, with early usage attributed to French ufologist Jacques Vallée in his 1966 book. Other figures who used the term in the late 1960s include Aimé Michel, James E. McDonald, and James Harder. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; in 1969 when presenting the findings of the Condon Report. Skeptic Philip J. Klass also used the term in his 1968 book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context leading up to the modern ETH. It traces the origins of the idea of extraterrestrial life and visitation to earlier concepts, including Percival Lowell&amp;rsquo;s theories about Martian canals and ancient Martian civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH, linking unidentified aircraft to alien life, took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34;&gt;Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents examples of early speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a French newspaper story from 1864 about the discovery of an alien-like creature inside an egg-shaped structure. It also discusses H. G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;The War of the Worlds&amp;rdquo; (1898), which popularized the idea of Martian visitation and invasion. The section notes a surge in &amp;ldquo;mystery airship&amp;rdquo; reports in the late 19th century, with some speculating about Martian origins. It also mentions the influence of comic strips, radio shows, and movies like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon in popularizing the idea of alien visitation in spaceships. Orson Welles&amp;rsquo; 1938 radio broadcast of &amp;ldquo;The War of the Worlds&amp;rdquo; caused some public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34;&gt;The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the events surrounding the Kenneth Arnold sighting in 1947 and the subsequent &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; craze. It details Arnold&amp;rsquo;s initial report of seeing unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier and his consideration of the possibility of extraterrestrial origins. The section notes the widespread speculation in newspapers about the nature of the &amp;ldquo;saucers,&amp;rdquo; including theories about secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria. It mentions Senator Glen Taylor&amp;rsquo;s comment about wishing the saucers were spaceships from another planet and R. DeWitt Miller&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that they could be vehicles from Mars or other dimensions. The section also cites journalist Edward R. Murrow&amp;rsquo;s observation that the ETH did not gain widespread attention until about 18 months after Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-public-opinion&#34;&gt;Evolution of Public Opinion &lt;a href=&#34;#evolution-of-public-opinion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines how public opinion regarding UFOs and the ETH evolved. It mentions the release of the first U.S. poll of public UFO perceptions by Gallup in August 1947, which showed that most people either had no opinion or believed there was a mundane explanation for the sightings. The section also discusses the influence of movies depicting flying saucers and aliens in the early 1950s. It cites a poll published in Popular Science magazine in 1951, which reported that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen a man-made aircraft. By 1957, 25% of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A Roper poll in 2002 reported that 56% of respondents thought UFOs were real, with 48% believing that UFOs had visited Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion&#34;&gt;Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses NASA&amp;rsquo;s evolving stance on UAPs. In June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, exploring the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP with an agnostic approach, involving experts from various fields to collect data and deduce the identity of such UAP. In August 2021, Kopparapu presented a paper supporting ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-or-government-studies&#34;&gt;Private or Government Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#private-or-government-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents examples of private or government studies that have concluded in favor of the ETH or have had members who disagreed with official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 Top Secret USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s 1948 Top Secret Estimate of the Situation, which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation for the most perplexing unexplained cases. The section mentions a secret West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, which also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. It also discusses the CIA&amp;rsquo;s internal scientific review of UFOs in the early 1950s, noting that some CIA scientists were seriously considering the ETH. The section mentions extraterrestrial &amp;ldquo;believers&amp;rdquo; within Project Blue Book, including Major Dewey Fournet and consultant J. Allen Hynek, who later became a staunch supporter of the ETH. It also cites statements from former CIA Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, who urged Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects. The section mentions Greek physicist Paul Santorini&amp;rsquo;s claim that a 1947 Greek government investigation into the European Ghost rockets concluded that they were extraterrestrial. It also discusses the 1968 Condon Report, noting that many members of the study disagreed with Condon&amp;rsquo;s methods and biases. The section mentions the 1999 private French COMETA report, which concluded that the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors best accounted for the facts. It also discusses Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of the official French UFO investigation SEPRA, who stated that 14% of the cases studied by SEPRA were &amp;lsquo;utterly inexplicable and extraterrestrial&amp;rsquo; in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34;&gt;Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It notes that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien encounters. It states that despite ardent believers, no rigorous analysis has ever concluded that various UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34;&gt;U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery &lt;a href=&#34;#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the U.S. military&amp;rsquo;s investigation of UFOs and its efforts to debunk the ETH. It mentions the formation of Project Sign in 1947, the first official U.S. military UFO study. It notes that Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation for all UFO reports, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The section also discusses the CIA&amp;rsquo;s Robertson Panel, which was organized in 1953 to review the Blue Book&amp;rsquo;s best evidence and recommend an official policy of public debunkery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;involvement-of-scientists&#34;&gt;Involvement of Scientists &lt;a href=&#34;#involvement-of-scientists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the scientific community&amp;rsquo;s response to the ETH. It notes that the scientific community has shown very little support for the ETH, largely accepting the explanation that UFO reports are the result of misinterpretations or hoaxes. It mentions Stephen Hawking&amp;rsquo;s skepticism about the ETH. The section cites Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s observation about the emotional nature of the idea of extraterrestrial visitation and the potential for self-deception. It also quotes Peter A. Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s statement about the narrow polarization of the UFO debate around the ETH. The section presents the results of a 1973 poll of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics members, which found that about 10% believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space. It also presents the results of a 1977 poll of American Astronomical Society members, which asked them to assign probabilities to eight possible explanations for UFOs. The section summarizes the primary scientific arguments against ETH, as outlined by J. Allen Hynek, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon in time and space, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34;&gt;Fewer Sightings Despite Camera Phone Technology &lt;a href=&#34;#fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the argument that the proliferation of smartphone camera technology has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, calling into question the claimed phenomenology of UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa-1&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents NASA&amp;rsquo;s official standpoint on the ETH, which is that it lacks empirical evidence. It quotes David Morrison&amp;rsquo;s statements that no one has ever found a single artifact or any other convincing evidence for alien visits and that no claims of UFOs as being alien craft have any validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cia&#34;&gt;CIA &lt;a href=&#34;#cia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions the CIA&amp;rsquo;s organization of the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk the data collected by the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Project Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the book&amp;rsquo;s central argument: that an extraterrestrial craft crashed in New Mexico while observing nuclear weapons activity, and the US government engaged in a cover-up. It highlights accounts of debris described as &amp;ldquo;nothing made on this earth&amp;rdquo; and mentions witnesses like Bill Brazel, Floyd Proctor, and Walt Whitman Jr. The section also notes the book&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the idea that the debris shown in photos with Marcel was substituted as part of the cover-up. It also mentions the claim that the military sought to discredit the growing interest in flying saucers. The section also notes that the authors claimed to have interviewed over 90 witnesses, but only a fraction of those accounts appear in the book. The section also notes that the book elevated Marcel&amp;rsquo;s narrative above that of Cavitt, whose description of the debris contradicted Marcel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-bodies&#34;&gt;Alien bodies &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-bodies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the reception of the book, noting that critics deemed it &amp;ldquo;a collection of wild hearsay&amp;rdquo; and that it &amp;ldquo;did not make the commercial impact its authors hoped.&amp;rdquo; It also mentions accusations against Moore regarding the Majestic 12 documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions Moore&amp;rsquo;s admission at a 1989 MUFON conference that he had engaged in &amp;ldquo;disinformation&amp;rdquo; activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-views&#34;&gt;Modern views &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section references the 1993 inquiry by the General Accounting Office in response to US congressman Steven Schiff, which led to a 1994 Air Force report concluding that the recovered material was likely debris from Project Mogul, a military surveillance program using high-altitude balloons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gulf Breeze UFO incident</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;gulf-breeze-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Gulf Breeze UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#gulf-breeze-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Breeze UFO incident refers to a series of claimed UFO sightings that occurred in Gulf Breeze, Florida, between November 1987 and May 1988. The events gained widespread attention after the &lt;em&gt;Gulf Breeze Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; newspaper published photographs purportedly showing a UFO, provided by local contractor Ed Walters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;events-of-november-11-1987--may-1-1988&#34;&gt;Events of November 11, 1987 – May 1, 1988 &lt;a href=&#34;#events-of-november-11-1987--may-1-1988&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Walters claimed to have been immobilized by a blue beam on November 11, 1987, after which he took photos of a UFO hovering near his home. He reported multiple subsequent encounters, taking more photos and even videotaping the object. Walters also claimed to have witnessed the craft landing and aliens exiting, communicating with him telepathically in English and Spanish, and even being lifted off the ground by a blue beam. He reported a total of nineteen sightings or encounters. On one occasion, he claimed the UFO leaked a liquid that continued to boil for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigation&#34;&gt;Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters initially provided his photographs to the &lt;em&gt;Gulf Breeze Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; anonymously. He later admitted to being the photographer and submitted to a polygraph test, which indicated he believed his photos were real. Walters also claimed to have experienced missing time on three prior occasions and under hypnosis, stated he had been abducted by aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several individuals investigated the claims. Ray Stanford initially questioned the weather data related to the photos but later conceded they were likely taken on the reported day. Phillip Klass dismissed the photos as inauthentic. Robert Nathan from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggested the images were double exposures or manipulated. Ed Gray, the mayor of Gulf Breeze, also concluded the photos were fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budd Hopkins believed Walters&amp;rsquo; claims were genuine, citing his polygraph test and refusal of a book deal. Bruce Maccabee found a good chance the photos were real. Willy Smith from UNICAT suggested a support under the UFO in the photos indicated it was a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eglin Air Force Base, located near Gulf Breeze, reported no unusual activity or radar blips during the alleged sightings. Gulf Breeze&amp;rsquo;s police chief, Jerry Brown, attributed the sightings to hysteria and misidentification of activity at the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;eyewitness-reports&#34;&gt;Eyewitness Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#eyewitness-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of Walters&amp;rsquo; photos, numerous other residents reported sightings in the Gulf Breeze area. These reports described orange glows, beams of light, and oval or oblong crafts. Fenner McConnell and his wife Shirley claimed to have seen a disc-shaped aircraft with no wings. Brenda Pollak, a Gulf Breeze councilwoman, reported seeing an orange light and witnessed Walters taking photos of a UFO at Shoreline Park. Santa Rosa County Commissioner John Broxson also claimed to have seen unusual lights. Other residents, like Art and Mary Hufford, and Jeff Thompson, reported seeing similar objects. A tollbooth operator, Jerry Thompson, reported seeing thirteen pink-lighted objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-research-group-response&#34;&gt;UFO Research Group Response &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-research-group-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Walters, particularly within MUFON, viewed the mass sightings as evidence of the phenomena&amp;rsquo;s authenticity. MUFON&amp;rsquo;s director, Walter Andrus, considered the Gulf Breeze incident their &amp;ldquo;best case ever.&amp;rdquo; Donald Ware, MUFON&amp;rsquo;s Florida director, believed the aliens wanted the photos to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUFOS, founded by J. Allen Hynek, deemed Walters&amp;rsquo; photos fake due to inconsistencies in the craft&amp;rsquo;s windows and waviness suggesting reflection off water. Friends of Walters reportedly described him as a prankster who had planned &amp;ldquo;the ultimate prank&amp;rdquo; and noted parallels between his story and Whitley Streiber&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-discovered&#34;&gt;Model Discovered &lt;a href=&#34;#model-discovered&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, a model resembling the UFO in Walters&amp;rsquo; photos was found in the attic of his former home. The model was made of foam plates and drafting paper. Craig Myers of the &lt;em&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported the discovery and was able to duplicate Walters&amp;rsquo; photos using the model. Walters denied any knowledge of the model, claiming it was planted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the model caused division within the UFO community. Supporters claimed it was planted, while others expressed doubt in Walters&amp;rsquo; claims. It was also revealed that Walters had received a $200,000 book advance and was offered $450,000 for miniseries rights. Additionally, he had a prior criminal record for forgery and auto theft, for which he received a pardon from Governor Bob Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;renewed-interest-after-1990&#34;&gt;Renewed Interest After 1990 &lt;a href=&#34;#renewed-interest-after-1990&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO sightings continued at the Pensacola Bay Bridge into 1991. In 1993, a friend of the Walters family admitted to witnessing Ed faking the UFO pictures. Mark Curtis also reported that Walter and his wife had divorced in November 1992, splitting $2.5 million in assets believed to have come from the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUFON held its first annual UFO symposium in Pensacola in 1990, which continued for the rest of the decade. The publicity attracted tourists and UFO sightseers, boosting the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-media&#34;&gt;In the Media &lt;a href=&#34;#in-the-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Breeze UFO case was featured on &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt; and a TV special called &amp;ldquo;UFO Cover-UP&amp;hellip;Live!&amp;rdquo;.

&lt;p&gt;This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the Canary Islands. The article has been flagged for needing additional citations, requiring cleanup, and having multiple issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists specific dates of reported UFO sightings in the Canary Islands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1974 – 24 November:&lt;/strong&gt; A sighting is recorded on this date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1976 – 22 June:&lt;/strong&gt; This sighting is notable due to its duration (over 40 minutes), multiple locations (Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera, Gran Canaria, and a ship at sea), and numerous witnesses (hundreds of people, including civilians and military personnel). Two witnesses reported seeing occupants inside the craft, but this account is considered dubious by Antonio Munaiz, a military judge who wrote the Spanish government report, and Carlos Dolz de Espejo, the lieutenant general of the Air Force at the time. The official report by the Spanish Air Force was declassified in June 1994, with much of its content released earlier in 1977 by journalist and paranormal investigator J.J. Benitez, who used it for a book on UFO cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1976 – 19 November:&lt;/strong&gt; Another sighting is noted on this date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1979 – 5 March:&lt;/strong&gt; A final sighting is listed for this date.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34;&gt;Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI) &lt;a href=&#34;#communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CETI is a branch of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) that focuses on composing and deciphering interstellar messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. A well-known CETI experiment is the 1974 Arecibo message composed by Frank Drake. The abbreviations CETI and SETI are generic and do not refer to any particular organization like the SETI Institute. CETI research focuses on mathematical languages, pictorial systems (like the Arecibo message), algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; language communication. Research also addresses how to overcome problems of decipherment in interplanetary communication, similar to the challenges posed by undeciphered writing systems in human communication like Linear A. In 2015, scientists including Douglas Vakoch, David Grinspoon, Seth Shostak, and David Brin discussed active SETI and the potential risks of transmitting messages to extraterrestrials. A statement signed by many in the SETI community emphasized the need for a global discussion before sending any messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, speculation about inhabitants of other planets was common, with many believing intelligent beings lived on the Moon, Mars, and/or Venus. Before radio, proposals for signaling extraterrestrials included Carl Friedrich Gauss&amp;rsquo;s 1820 suggestion to draw a giant Pythagorean triangle on the Siberian tundra and Joseph Johann Littrow&amp;rsquo;s 1819 idea to use the Sahara as a &amp;ldquo;blackboard&amp;rdquo; with trenches filled with water and kerosene to create signals. Astronomers like Franz von Paula Gruithuisen also looked for signs of life, claiming to see cities and agriculture on the Moon and evidence of life on Venus. By the late 1800s, Mars became the focus after Giovanni Schiaparelli reported &amp;ldquo;canali&amp;rdquo; (channels) on Mars, which were mistranslated as &amp;ldquo;canals,&amp;rdquo; sparking enthusiasm about Martian life. Inventor Charles Cros sought funding for a giant mirror to signal Martians, while Nikola Tesla believed his inventions could be used for interplanetary communication and claimed to have observed extraterrestrial radio signals. The Guzman Prize was created, offering 100,000 francs to the first person to establish interplanetary communication, excluding Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mathematical-and-scientific-languages&#34;&gt;Mathematical and Scientific Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#mathematical-and-scientific-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers artificial languages designed for interstellar communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lincos-lingua-cosmica&#34;&gt;Lincos (Lingua cosmica) &lt;a href=&#34;#lincos-lingua-cosmica&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans Freudenthal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse&lt;/em&gt; (1960) expands upon Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols. A dictionary resembling Lincos was featured in Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; and its film adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;astraglossa&#34;&gt;Astraglossa &lt;a href=&#34;#astraglossa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancelot Hogben&amp;rsquo;s 1963 essay &amp;ldquo;Astraglossa&amp;rdquo; describes a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses, where short pulses represent numbers and trains of long pulses represent symbols for addition, subtraction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;carl-sagan&#34;&gt;Carl Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#carl-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores how a message might be constructed for communication with an alien civilization, using prime numbers as a starting point, followed by universal principles and facts of mathematics and science. Sagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject, and an updated collection of articles was published in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34;&gt;A Language Based on the Fundamental Facts of Science &lt;a href=&#34;#a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle&amp;rsquo;s 1992 paper, &lt;em&gt;A language based on the fundamental facts of science&lt;/em&gt;, describes a language similar in syntax to Astraglossa and Lincos, but which builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34;&gt;Busch General-Purpose Binary Language Used in Lone Signal Transmissions &lt;a href=&#34;#busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language later used in the Lone Signal project to transmit crowdsourced messages to extraterrestrial intelligence (METI). This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the Lone Signal hailing message. The Lone Signal project sent messages to Gliese 526 (HD 119850) in the constellation Boötes, with the message sent on July 10, 2013, and expected to arrive in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pictorial-messages&#34;&gt;Pictorial Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#pictorial-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictorial communication systems describe fundamental mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as bitmaps. These messages assume the recipient has similar visual capabilities and can understand basic mathematics and geometry. A critique is that they presume a shared understanding of shapes, which may not be the case with a species with substantially different vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pioneer-probes&#34;&gt;Pioneer Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#pioneer-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two etched plaques, known as the Pioneer plaques, were included aboard the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft when they launched in 1972 and 1973. The plaques depict the location of the Solar System within the galaxy and the Earth within the Solar System, as well as the form of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;voyager-probes&#34;&gt;Voyager Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#voyager-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977, the Voyager probes carried two golden records that were inscribed with diagrams similar to the Pioneer plaques, depicting the human form, the Solar System, and its location. Also included were recordings of images and sounds from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arecibo-message&#34;&gt;Arecibo Message &lt;a href=&#34;#arecibo-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arecibo message, transmitted in 1974, was a 1,679-pixel bitmap that, when properly arranged into 73 rows and 23 columns, shows the numbers one through ten; the atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus; the formulas for the sugars and bases that make up the nucleotides of DNA; the number of nucleotides in the human genome; the double helix structure of DNA; a simple illustration of a human being and its height; the human population of Earth; a diagram of the Solar System; and an illustration of the Arecibo telescope with its diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmic-call-messages&#34;&gt;Cosmic Call Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-call-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt; messages consisted of digital sections – &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo;, a copy of the Arecibo Message, the Bilingual Image Glossary, and the Braastad message – as well as text, audio, video, and other image files submitted for transmission by people around the world. The &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo; was composed by Stéphane Dumas and Yvan Dutil, and represents a multi-page bitmap that builds a vocabulary of symbols representing numbers and mathematical operations. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from Evpatoria Planetary Radar in Russia under the scientific guidance of Alexander L. Zaitsev. Richard Braastad coordinated the overall project. Star systems to which the messages were sent include 16 Cyg A, 15 Sge, HD 178428, Gl 777, Hip 4872, HD 245409, 55 Cnc, HD 10307, and 47 UMa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;multi-modal-messages&#34;&gt;Multi-Modal Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#multi-modal-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teen-age-message&#34;&gt;Teen-Age Message &lt;a href=&#34;#teen-age-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Teen-Age Message&lt;/em&gt;, composed by Russian scientists (Zaitsev, Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the 70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center in Ukraine to six star systems resembling that of the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consists of three parts: a coherent-sounding radio signal with slow Doppler wavelength tuning, analog information representing musical melodies performed on the theremin, and Arecibo-like binary digital information. Star systems to which the message was sent are HD 197076, 47 UMa, 37 Gem, HD 126053, HD 76151, and HD 193664.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34;&gt;Cosmic Call 2 (Cosmic Call 2003) Message &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cosmic Call-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program &lt;em&gt;Ella&lt;/em&gt;, and the Braastad message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;algorithmic-messages&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#algorithmic-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic communication systems describe a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a virtual machine. Advantages include localized communication, forward error correction, and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmicos&#34;&gt;CosmicOS &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmicos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CosmicOS&lt;/em&gt;, designed by Paul Fitzpatrick at MIT, describes a virtual machine that is derived from lambda calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;logic-gate-matrices&#34;&gt;Logic Gate Matrices &lt;a href=&#34;#logic-gate-matrices&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic Gate Matrices&lt;/em&gt; (LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal virtual machine that is constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;natural-language-messages&#34;&gt;Natural Language Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-language-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research focuses on receiving a signal or message that is either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or one that is in its natural communicative form. Methods are being developed to detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content. This structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language, and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt; messages consisted of digital sections, including a &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo; composed by Stéphane Dumas and Yvan Dutil, a copy of the Arecibo Message, the Bilingual Image Glossary, and the Braastad message, as well as text, audio, video, and other image files. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from Evpatoria Planetary Radar in Russia under the scientific guidance of Alexander L. Zaitsev. Star systems targeted included 16 Cyg A, 15 Sge, HD 178428, Gl 777, Hip 4872, HD 245409, 55 Cnc, HD 10307, and 47 UMa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses messages that combine different forms of communication, such as sound, images, and text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teen-age-message&#34;&gt;Teen-Age Message &lt;a href=&#34;#teen-age-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Teen-Age Message&lt;/em&gt;, composed by Russian scientists (Zaitsev, Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the 70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center in Ukraine to six star systems resembling the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consisted of a coherent-sounding radio signal, musical melodies performed on the theremin, and Arecibo-like binary digital information. Star systems targeted included 197076, 47 UMa, 37 Gem, 126053, 76151, and 193664.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34;&gt;Cosmic Call 2 (Cosmic Call 2003) Message &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt;-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program &lt;em&gt;Ella&lt;/em&gt;, and the Braastad message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;algorithmic-messages&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#algorithmic-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic communication systems describe a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmicos&#34;&gt;CosmicOS &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmicos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic Gate Matrices&lt;/em&gt; (LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal virtual machine constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;natural-language-messages&#34;&gt;Natural Language Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-language-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research focuses on detecting and deciphering signals or messages that are either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or are in their natural communicative form. Methods are being developed to detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content. This structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language, and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected. John Elliott is a key researcher in this area. A key concept is that human languages conform to a Zipfian distribution, which may also apply to alien languages. Laurance Doyle explains that the slope of a line that represents individual tokens in a stream of tokens may indicate whether the stream contains linguistic or other structured content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_e77076cc2caf/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-planet-2005-tv-series&#34;&gt;Alien Planet (2005 TV series) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-planet-2005-tv-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2005 docufiction TV special created for the Discovery Channel, based on Wayne Barlowe&amp;rsquo;s 1990 book &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;. It explores the imagined extraterrestrial life of the fictional planet Darwin IV in the style of a nature documentary. It features scientists and science fiction figures discussing Darwin IV as if it had actually been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Von Braun&lt;/em&gt; interstellar spacecraft travels to Darwin IV, 6.5 light-years away. It deploys the &lt;em&gt;Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/em&gt; to find landing sites for probes. The first probe, &lt;em&gt;Balboa&lt;/em&gt;, explodes during entry. Backup probes &lt;em&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/em&gt; (Leo) and &lt;em&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/em&gt; (Ike) land successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic probes, called Horus Probes, are equipped with inflatable balloons, solar receptors, computers, sensors, and smaller robots. They have limited AI and are programmed with different personalities. Ike is cautious, while Leo is a risk-taker. They are equipped with a holographic message for any sentient life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probes encounter various lifeforms, including Arrowtongues, Gyrosprinters, Trunk Suckers, Daggerwrists, and Unths. Ike studies plant life, while Leo goes after big game. A massive storm hits, and Ike launches weather balloons. Leo finds Bladderhorns and attempts to present the holographic message, but is interrupted. Ike encounters Grovebacks, Littoralopes, Skewers, Beach Quills, and Prongheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leo briefly re-establishes contact with &lt;em&gt;Von Braun&lt;/em&gt; until a mysterious creature interferes. Ike is ordered to search for Leo. Ike finds a sea that is Amoebic in nature and encounters giant Sea Striders. Ike finds Leo&amp;rsquo;s last known location, where a Skewer is killed by a spear. Ike finds Leo and the sapient Eosapiens. Ike presents the holographic message to the Eosapiens, but one of them destroys the camera disk, and the Eosapiens attack Ike. The wrecked camera disk records the Eosapiens carrying Ike away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary from Michio Kaku, Stephen Hawking, Jack Horner, James B. Garvin, and George Lucas is interspersed throughout the special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Planet&lt;/em&gt; is based on &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt; (1990) by Wayne Barlowe. Barlowe served as one of the executive producers. Scientists and other figures were assembled to comment on the life on Darwin IV. The documentary gives the appearance of the featured scientists having designed Darwin IV and its animals, most of what is shown of the actual planet and its life follows what is described in &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;, which is set in the mid-24th century, &lt;em&gt;Alien Planet&lt;/em&gt; is set in the near future, and the planet is explored using sophisticated probes. The technology featured is more advanced than present-day technology, but is based on current trends and informed speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwayne A. Day of &lt;em&gt;The Space Review&lt;/em&gt; gave the special a positive review. Some criticism was leveled at the strangeness of the creatures showcased. Day stated that the animals are bizarre and frequently border on the implausible. A review in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; stated that a few too many of the creatures seem like cartoonish monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-canada&#34;&gt;List of Alleged UFO Sightings in Canada &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-canada&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents a compilation of reported UFO sightings in Canada, spanning from the mid-20th century to recent years. It includes details of specific incidents, locations, and any investigations or cultural responses associated with these events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1951-gander-newfoundland&#34;&gt;1951, Gander, Newfoundland &lt;a href=&#34;#1951-gander-newfoundland&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details an incident on February 10, 1951, where a U.S. Navy aircraft flying from Gander, Newfoundland, to Iceland reported a near-collision with a large, orange, circular UFO. The UFO reportedly circled the American aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1960-clan-lake-northwest-territories&#34;&gt;1960, Clan Lake, Northwest Territories &lt;a href=&#34;#1960-clan-lake-northwest-territories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts a report from June 18, 1960, where a prospector informed the Yellowknife RCMP detachment about a UFO sighting at Clan Lake, 30 miles north of Yellowknife. The prospector and his partner claimed to have seen a hovering object that hit the lake&amp;rsquo;s surface. The RCMP investigated but found nothing. Chris Rutkowski, a UFOlogist, is mentioned in connection with this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1967-falcon-lake-manitoba&#34;&gt;1967, Falcon Lake, Manitoba &lt;a href=&#34;#1967-falcon-lake-manitoba&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the Falcon Lake Incident, where Stefan Michalak claimed to have been burned by a flying saucer on May 19, 1967, near Falcon Lake, Manitoba. The section mentions grid-like burn marks on Michalak&amp;rsquo;s chest and T-shirt. Ufologists consider this one of the most documented UFO stories in Canada. Two books about the incident are listed. Skeptic Aaron Sakulich suggests Michalak&amp;rsquo;s burns were likely caused by an accident related to alcohol consumption, and the story was fabricated to deter other prospectors. The Royal Canadian Mint released a commemorative coin depicting the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1967-shag-harbour-nova-scotia&#34;&gt;1967, Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia &lt;a href=&#34;#1967-shag-harbour-nova-scotia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the Shag Harbour incident, involving the purported crash of a UFO in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, in October 1967. The Royal Canadian Mint also released a glow-in-the-dark coin depicting this sighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details a sighting in Prince George, British Columbia, on January 1, 1969, where three unrelated witnesses reported a strange, round object radiating a yellow-orange light in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1974-langenburg-saskatchewan&#34;&gt;1974, Langenburg, Saskatchewan &lt;a href=&#34;#1974-langenburg-saskatchewan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts the experience of Edwin Fuhr, a farmer from Langenburg, Saskatchewan, who claimed to have seen five saucer-shaped objects hovering near a slough on September 1, 1974. An RCMP report confirmed the presence of five circles matching Fuhr&amp;rsquo;s description. The Royal Canadian Mint commemorated the event with a silver coin in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;19751976-southern-manitoba&#34;&gt;1975–1976, Southern Manitoba &lt;a href=&#34;#19751976-southern-manitoba&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions multiple sightings of a red glowing UFO in Southern Manitoba during 1975 and 1976. The UFO was nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Charlie Redstar.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes a UFO sighting in Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, on October 26, 1978, witnessed by twelve individuals. Constable James Blackwood of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police also observed the object. The Royal Canadian Mint released a glow-in-the-dark coin depicting the sighting. A separate sighting in Clarenville in 2016 is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1990-montreal-quebec&#34;&gt;1990, Montreal, Quebec &lt;a href=&#34;#1990-montreal-quebec&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details a sighting on November 7, 1990, in Montreal, Quebec, where witnesses reported a round, metallic object with lights forming a circle over the Bonaventure Hotel. The phenomenon lasted three hours. The sighting was commemorated on a Royal Canadian Mint coin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-contact&#34;&gt;First Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; is a science fiction novelette written by Murray Leinster, published in &lt;em&gt;Astounding Science Fiction&lt;/em&gt; in May 1945. It received a retro Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1996. The story is notable for its early depiction of a universal translator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story revolves around the crew of the exploration ship &lt;em&gt;Llanvabon&lt;/em&gt; encountering an alien vessel near the Crab Nebula. Both ships are technologically matched and represent their respective civilizations. The central conflict arises from the mutual fear that either ship could trace the other back to their home planet, leading to potential exploitation or destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication is established, revealing that the aliens are humanoid bipeds who perceive infrared light and communicate via microwaves. Despite the differences, the crews, particularly a young human named Tommy Dort and his alien counterpart &amp;ldquo;Buck,&amp;rdquo; develop a rapport. However, the underlying tension remains due to the strategic implications of revealing their home worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story reaches a climax when Tommy proposes a solution: a mutual exchange of crews and ships. Each crew would take the other&amp;rsquo;s ship back to their respective home planets after disabling all tracking equipment. This plan is complicated by the realization that the aliens have independently conceived the same strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story concludes with the successful exchange, each crew departing in the other&amp;rsquo;s ship. They remove any identifying information that could lead back to their home worlds. Both sides anticipate technological gains from the exchange and plan to meet again in the future. Tommy expresses optimism about future relations, based on his shared sense of humor with Buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;radio-plays&#34;&gt;Radio Plays &lt;a href=&#34;#radio-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; was adapted into radio plays for &lt;em&gt;Dimension X&lt;/em&gt; on September 8, 1951, and for &lt;em&gt;X Minus One&lt;/em&gt; on October 6, 1955. The &lt;em&gt;X Minus One&lt;/em&gt; version was a condensed adaptation with an altered ending. The story was also performed on &lt;em&gt;Exploring Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; on January 15, 1958.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;style&#34;&gt;Style &lt;a href=&#34;#style&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing style of &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; is considered representative of the Golden Age of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legal-action-against-paramount-pictures&#34;&gt;Legal Action Against Paramount Pictures &lt;a href=&#34;#legal-action-against-paramount-pictures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Murray Leinster&amp;rsquo;s estate filed a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures, alleging trademark infringement related to the film &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/em&gt;. The estate claimed ownership of the term &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; and argued that Paramount&amp;rsquo;s use of the phrase infringed on their trademark. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled in favor of Paramount, granting summary judgment and dismissing the suit. The court determined that the term &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; had become generic, describing a common science fiction trope, and lacked the necessary secondary meaning to be protected as a trademark.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dover-demon&#34;&gt;Dover Demon &lt;a href=&#34;#dover-demon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dover Demon is a creature reportedly sighted in Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the reported sightings of the Dover Demon in April 1977. William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Bartlett, John Baxter, and Abby Brabham, all teenagers at the time, independently reported seeing a strange creature. Bartlett described it as about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth, with a watermelon-shaped head. Baxter reported a similar sighting on Miller Hill Road, and Brabham claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue. The teenagers drew sketches of the creature, with Bartlett swearing on a stack of Bibles to the accuracy of his drawing. The locations of the sightings, when plotted on a map, formed a straight line over 2 miles. The sightings became public in May, and a local investigator noted similarities to the creatures in the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter. The Mutual UFO Network also investigated the sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-explanations&#34;&gt;Possible explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the Dover Demon sightings. One suggestion is that the creature was a foal or a moose calf. Skeptic Joe Nickell proposes that the creature was likely a snowy owl, citing its size and plumage, which could reflect yellow headlights. The &amp;ldquo;long spindly arms&amp;rdquo; could be the partially opened wings of the owl. Police suggested the sightings were a school vacation hoax. Ben Radford suggests the sightings may have been influenced by the release of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the Dover Demon&amp;rsquo;s appearances in popular culture. It was featured in an episode of the American horror television series &lt;em&gt;Lost Tapes&lt;/em&gt; on Animal Planet in 2009. The Dover Demon appears as a character in the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;, where it can see into the future, and in &lt;em&gt;The Perhapanauts&lt;/em&gt;. It also made appearances in &lt;em&gt;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&lt;/em&gt;. A Dover Demon appears in the webcomic &lt;em&gt;Gunnerkrigg Court&lt;/em&gt;. In the manga series &lt;em&gt;Dandadan&lt;/em&gt;, an alien known as Dover Demon takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nash-Fortenberry UFO sighting occurred on July 14, 1952, when two commercial pilots, William B. Nash and William H. Fortenberry, reported seeing eight UFOs in a tight echelon formation over Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two commercial pilots, William B. Nash and William H. Fortenberry, reported observing eight UFOs flying in formation over Chesapeake Bay, Virginia. Ufologists highlight the pilots&amp;rsquo; observation allowed for measurements of the objects&amp;rsquo; motion and size relative to known landmarks. The sighting was reportedly corroborated by independent ground witnesses. Project Blue Book listed the case as an &amp;ldquo;unknown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Howard Menzel suggested the pilots might have seen distorted ground lights due to haze or fireflies trapped in the cockpit window. Steuart Campbell proposed the sighting was a mirage of Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pascagoula Abduction refers to an alleged UFO sighting and alien abduction that occurred in 1973. Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed to have been abducted and examined by extraterrestrial beings while fishing near the Pascagoula River in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alleged-abduction&#34;&gt;Alleged abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alleged-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of October 11, 1973, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker reported to the Jackson County, Mississippi, sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office that they experienced an unusual event while fishing on a pier along the Pascagoula River. They described hearing a strange whirring sound and seeing flashing blue lights, followed by the appearance of an oval-shaped object. Hickson and Parker claimed they were paralyzed and then taken aboard the object by three creatures with robotic features and crab-like pincers, where they underwent an examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, Charles Hickson engaged in interviews, lectures, and television appearances, including an episode of &lt;em&gt;To Tell The Truth&lt;/em&gt;. He also claimed additional encounters with aliens and authored a book titled &lt;em&gt;UFO Contact at Pascagoula&lt;/em&gt;. Calvin Parker attended UFO conventions and started a company called &amp;ldquo;UFO Investigations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Hickson died in September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Calvin Parker released his own book, &lt;em&gt;Pascagoula: The Closest Encounter, My Story&lt;/em&gt;, providing his full account of the event and its impact on his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, a historical marker was unveiled at the site of the alleged abduction. Calvin Parker, along with Hickson&amp;rsquo;s son and family, attended the unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin Parker died in August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation journalist and UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass found discrepancies in Hickson&amp;rsquo;s story and noted his refusal to take a polygraph exam. Klass concluded that the case was a hoax. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell questioned Hickson&amp;rsquo;s behavior and suggested that the alien encounter may have been a hypnagogic &amp;ldquo;waking dream state.&amp;rdquo; Nickell also suggested that Parker&amp;rsquo;s corroboration was due to suggestibility, as he initially claimed to have passed out during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-implants&#34;&gt;Alien Implants &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-implants&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien implants are physical objects that some people believe are placed in their bodies after being abducted by aliens. These implants are purported to have various capabilities, including telepresence, mind control, and biotelemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of alien implants can be traced back to a 1957 radio show interview with ufologist John Robinson, who recounted a neighbor&amp;rsquo;s claim of being kidnapped by aliens and controlled by &amp;ldquo;small earphones.&amp;rdquo; Betty Andreasson claimed aliens implanted a device in her nose in 1967. Dorothy Wallis made a similar claim in 1983. Authors like Whitley Strieber popularized the idea of alien abductions and associated implants. John E. Mack examined an object given to him by a client who claimed it came out of her nose after an abduction. Roger Leir claimed to have removed alien implants from patients. Skeptic Joe Nickell suggests that supposed alien implants are ordinary materials that become lodged in the body and surrounded by scar tissue. Virgil Priscu stated that there is &amp;ldquo;No mystery, no implants&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien implants, depicted as small needles inserted into victims, first appeared in the 1953 film &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Alien is a British comic book character who appeared in strips published by Fleetway Publications. He debuted in the preview issue of the science fiction anthology &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; in October 1988. The character&amp;rsquo;s strip was one of four linked serials in &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; and was later briefly featured in &lt;em&gt;Eagle&lt;/em&gt; after &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; was canceled. Joe Alien is the last survivor of the planet Xgangbe-4 and joins the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; mission to help humanity find a new home, commanding the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat 2&lt;/em&gt; exploration shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrie Tomlinson created Joe Alien as part of a new science fiction anthology, &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt;, for Fleetway Publications. The concept involved linking all five features in the comic to form an overall narrative centered on the spaceship &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt;. Tomlinson created four lead characters, including Joe Alien, to head exploration teams. Massimo Belardinelli was the initial artist for &amp;ldquo;Joe Alien,&amp;rdquo; with Tomlinson praising his ability to bring the story to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publishing-history&#34;&gt;Publishing history &lt;a href=&#34;#publishing-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; began publication in October 1988, featuring &amp;ldquo;Joe Alien&amp;rdquo; as the color strip. Ron Smith took over as the artist from the third issue. &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; was canceled after 12 issues and merged with &lt;em&gt;Eagle&lt;/em&gt; in March 1989. &amp;ldquo;Joe Alien&amp;rdquo; continued in &lt;em&gt;Eagle&lt;/em&gt; for four weeks in May 1989 to complete the story arc and also featured in three episodes of &amp;ldquo;The Wildcat Complete&amp;rdquo; anthology. Rebellion Developments purchased the rights to &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; in 2016 and announced plans to reprint the contents in collected editions. As of 2025, only &amp;ldquo;Turbo Jones&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Loner&amp;rdquo; have been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-summary&#34;&gt;Plot summary &lt;a href=&#34;#plot-summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Alien joins the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; mission after Turbo Jones realizes Earth is doomed. Joe, the last survivor of Xgangbe-4, possesses vast knowledge stored in an external brain-pack. He is selected for his intelligence and physical attributes. After the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; launches, Joe&amp;rsquo;s sensors locate a potential new home for the refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He leads the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat Two&lt;/em&gt; shuttle to scout Area 17, where his team encounters carnivorous vegetation and a two-headed alien. They discover that the plants are controlled by a mad human astronaut from a 2079 Mars mission, who is now worshipped as a god. Joe brokers an alliance with giant insects to escape and later participates in other expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe shares the story of the Xgangbe&amp;rsquo;s destruction by the Kargroz and his revenge. He is later chosen to find an alien shapeshifter on board the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt;. Joe, along with Jones, Loner, and Magee, is kidnapped by a Gamemaster of the Glarzon race but is released after defeating the Glarzon&amp;rsquo;s troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry details the book &amp;ldquo;A Verdade Sufocada&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;The Suffocated Truth&amp;rdquo;) written by Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a Brazilian military colonel convicted of torture during Brazil&amp;rsquo;s military dictatorship (1964-1985). The book presents Ustra&amp;rsquo;s perspective on the left-wing armed resistance during that period and his experiences as head of DOI-CODI, an agency known for political repression, torture, and murder of the dictatorship&amp;rsquo;s opponents. The book&amp;rsquo;s publication faced boycotts, requiring the author&amp;rsquo;s family to finance its print runs. It gained attention after being quoted by Jair Bolsonaro during Dilma Rousseff&amp;rsquo;s impeachment vote in 2016 and became a bestseller. However, it has been heavily criticized by historians and sociologists who question its reliability as a historical document.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;william-l-moore-ufologist&#34;&gt;William L. Moore (Ufologist) &lt;a href=&#34;#william-l-moore-ufologist&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Leonard Moore, born October 31, 1943, is an author and former UFO researcher who gained prominence from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. He is best known for co-authoring two books with Charles Berlitz, including &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;career&#34;&gt;Career &lt;a href=&#34;#career&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore&amp;rsquo;s interest in UFOs began in his teenage years. He graduated from Thiel College in Greenville, Pennsylvania, in 1965. After teaching language and humanities at various high schools, he became the Arizona state section director of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). He then transitioned to a career as a freelance writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He co-authored &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt; with Charles Berlitz in 1979, which explored the alleged naval military experiment aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Eldridge&lt;/em&gt; in 1943. In 1980, Moore and Berlitz co-wrote &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed that the Roswell UFO incident involved the crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 1987, Moore, along with ufologists Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman, circulated the Majestic 12 documents, which purported the existence of a high-level policy-making group overseeing UFOs and extraterrestrials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a 1989 MUFON conference, Moore admitted to engaging in &amp;ldquo;disinformation&amp;rdquo; activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt; has been largely dismissed as an unsubstantiated urban myth. &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; has been criticized as a collection of hearsay and unwarranted speculation. Critics have also pointed fingers at Moore regarding the fraudulent nature of the Majestic 12 documents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_a9fd8cc44766/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;max-evans-roswell&#34;&gt;Max Evans (Roswell) &lt;a href=&#34;#max-evans-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell &amp;ldquo;Max&amp;rdquo; Evans is a fictional character created by Melinda Metz for the &lt;em&gt;Roswell High&lt;/em&gt; book series and adapted for the &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt; television series (1999-2002). He is portrayed by Jason Behr in the original series and by Nathan Parsons in the CW reboot. Max is a central character throughout the series, first appearing in the pilot episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fictional-character-summary&#34;&gt;Fictional character summary &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-character-summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the TV character, distinguishing it from the &lt;em&gt;Roswell High&lt;/em&gt; book version. Max&amp;rsquo;s backstory reveals that in a previous life, he was Zan, the king of Antar. After Zan&amp;rsquo;s death, his DNA and human DNA were used to create alien/human hybrids or clones, including Isabel Evans (Vilandra, Zan&amp;rsquo;s sister), Michael Guerin (Rath, Vilandra&amp;rsquo;s betrothed), and Tess Harding (Ava, Zan&amp;rsquo;s bride). These clones were sent to Earth to escape their enemies, particularly Kivar. The craft carrying Max, Isabel, Michael, and Tess crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. Army initially took the alien pods, but they were rescued and hidden. The clones emerged in 1989, appearing as children. Max and Isabel were adopted by the Evans, while Michael ended up in foster care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max is presented as shy and introverted, a facade necessitated by his hybrid nature. He is a complex character, displaying both timidity and passion. Despite his initial shyness, he emerges as the leader among his friends. He is portrayed as a deep thinker, often spurred to action by his protective instincts. He takes responsibility for his actions and is known for his unique healing powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;powers-and-abilities&#34;&gt;Powers and abilities &lt;a href=&#34;#powers-and-abilities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max possesses molecular manipulation and telekinesis, abilities shared by the other hybrids. His unique power is healing through physical contact, famously used to save Liz Parker in the pilot episode. He also develops the ability to generate a force field. It is suggested that his healing ability can trigger the development of alien powers in those he heals, such as Liz Parker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relationship-with-liz-parker&#34;&gt;Relationship with Liz Parker &lt;a href=&#34;#relationship-with-liz-parker&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max&amp;rsquo;s love for Liz Parker is a central theme. He has been in love with her since childhood but keeps his distance due to his alien identity. He reveals his secret to save her life after she is shot, initiating the main plot of the show. Their connection is portrayed as deep and mysterious, with Liz able to sense when Max is in danger. Their relationship is considered a core aspect of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recurring-themes&#34;&gt;Recurring themes &lt;a href=&#34;#recurring-themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Max and Liz is presented as a modern example of forbidden love, with references to &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;. Maria De Luca refers to them as &amp;ldquo;modern Romeo and Juliet against the world.&amp;rdquo; The concept of soulmates is also a recurring theme, emphasizing their deep connection and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fictional-biography&#34;&gt;Fictional biography &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-biography&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
