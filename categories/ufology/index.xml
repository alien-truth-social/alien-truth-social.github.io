      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nordic-aliens&#34;&gt;Nordic Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#nordic-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ufology, &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites&amp;rdquo; are terms used to describe alleged humanoid extraterrestrial races from the Pleiades star cluster. These beings are said to resemble Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans, with features like tall stature (6-7 ft), blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some reports describe their skin tone as pale blue/grey or pastel purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural historian David J. Skal suggests that early stories of Nordic aliens may have been inspired by the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;. Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; noting that believers often associate Nordic aliens with spiritual growth and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ufology, Nordic aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1950s, many people, especially in Europe, claimed encounters with these beings. However, such claims became less common in later decades as the grey alien became more prevalent in extraterrestrial encounter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crop circle</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;crop-circle&#34;&gt;Crop Circle &lt;a href=&#34;#crop-circle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crop circle, also known as a crop formation or corn circle, is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural causes or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two hoaxers, claimed responsibility for creating over 200 crop circles throughout England. Reported circles in the United Kingdom appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population, and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury, and usually appear overnight. Archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but these do not appear overnight, and are always in the same places every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1678 news pamphlet &lt;em&gt;The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire&lt;/em&gt; describes a crop whose stalks were cut rather than bent. In 1686, English naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms in &lt;em&gt;The Natural History of Stafford-Shire&lt;/em&gt;, proposing air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991, meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles. An 1880 letter to the editor of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how several circles of flattened crops in a field were formed under suspicious circumstances and possibly caused by &amp;ldquo;cyclonic wind action&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;20th-century&#34;&gt;20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester. In &lt;em&gt;Fortean Times,&lt;/em&gt; David Wood reported that in 1940 he made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. In 1963, Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire and several circular and elliptical areas in nearby wheat fields. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes. During the 1960s, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada. On 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo;. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported they started creating crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo; case. The first film to depict a geometric crop circle, in this case created by super-intelligent ants, was the 1974 science-fiction film &lt;em&gt;Phase IV&lt;/em&gt;. The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared and spread since the late 1970s. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity. The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bower-and-chorley&#34;&gt;Bower and Chorley &lt;a href=&#34;#bower-and-chorley&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, made headlines by saying they had started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978, using simple tools. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a &amp;ldquo;cereologist&amp;rdquo;, Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978â€“1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;art-and-business&#34;&gt;Art and business &lt;a href=&#34;#art-and-business&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reports of simple circles in the 1970s, increasingly complex geometric designs have been created by anonymous artists, in some cases to attract tourists to an area. Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of its art practice and also for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set that was released on 7 September 1990, features an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. On the night of 11â€“12 July 1992, a crop-circle-making competition with a prize of Â£3,000 was held in Berkshire. In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own. In 2009, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts. A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A 3 ha (7 acres) crop circle depicting the emblem of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;legal-implications&#34;&gt;Legal implications &lt;a href=&#34;#legal-implications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1992, GÃ¡bor TakÃ¡cs and RÃ³bert Dallos, both then aged 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle in Hungary. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-origin&#34;&gt;Human origin &lt;a href=&#34;#human-origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-origins&#34;&gt;Natural origins &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather &lt;a href=&#34;#weather&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes. In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm. In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;animal-activity&#34;&gt;Animal activity &lt;a href=&#34;#animal-activity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-explanations&#34;&gt;Alternative explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In science magazines from the 1980s and 1990s, one could read reports suggesting that the plants were bent by something that could be microwave radiation, rather than broken by physical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paranormal&#34;&gt;Paranormal &lt;a href=&#34;#paranormal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have been the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators, ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lightning and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Responding to local beliefs that &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial beings&amp;rdquo; in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &amp;ldquo;man-made&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes-to-crops&#34;&gt;Changes to crops &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-to-crops&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have claimed to observe differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;related-art&#34;&gt;Related art &lt;a href=&#34;#related-art&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow, by using skis, snow shoes or just walking with ordinary shoes. Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in sand. Images can be made in forests by cutting trees, especially in areas with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;folklore&#34;&gt;Folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Crop circles are culture dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularised Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they do not appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of &amp;ldquo;fairie rings&amp;rdquo;. A 17th-century English woodcut called the &lt;em&gt;Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt; depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. In the&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unidentified flying object</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be immediately identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and escalated during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained. Government investigations and studies by various organizations have occurred over the years, but without confirmation of claims that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence or other unconventional hypotheses. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes. The philosophical implications of UFOs relate to epistemology, dealing with temporarily or permanently unknowable anomalous phenomena. The U.S. government has two entities dedicated to UFO data collection and analysis: NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the Department of Defense&amp;rsquo;s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs,&amp;rdquo; originating from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to replace the misleading term &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has gained usage in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; UAP is sometimes expanded to &amp;ldquo;unidentified anomalous phenomenon.&amp;rdquo; In popular culture, UFO has become synonymous with alien spacecraft, sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena after careful investigation. Common identified sources include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. The USAF&amp;rsquo;s 1952â€“1955 study categorized UFOs as balloons, astronomical objects, aircraft, light phenomena, birds, clouds, dust, insufficient information, psychological manifestations, unknown, and other. Allan Hendry, a CUFOS researcher, found that fewer than one percent of cases were hoaxes, with most sightings being misidentifications of prosaic phenomena due to inexperience or misperception. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that thorough investigation often reveals less to the stories than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, planetary conjunctions, and optical phenomena. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet, first recorded by Chinese astronomers, was often seen as a supernatural portent or omen. Some UFO enthusiasts have drawn parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, but art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens, a Roman writer, documented wonders and portents in Rome between 249 and 12 BCE, with descriptions resembling meteor showers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo, a Song Chinese scholar-official, described a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in his &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt; (1088).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woodcut by Hans Glaser from 1561, known as the &amp;ldquo;celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg,&amp;rdquo; has been linked to ancient astronaut claims, though skeptics argue it depicts a sundog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A similar report from 1566 over Basel, along with other leaflets from the 15th and 16th centuries, described &amp;ldquo;miracles&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sky spectacles&amp;rdquo; resembling natural phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1878, farmer John Martin reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer, marking one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From November 1896 to April 1897, newspapers reported numerous sightings of &amp;ldquo;mystery airships,&amp;rdquo; with some people claiming to have spoken to the pilots. Thomas Edison dismissed these reports as fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings included St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire, the planet Venus, hallucinations, and German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, referred to as &amp;ldquo;Russian hail&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected, primarily by the Swedish military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science fiction depictions of spacecraft similar to flying saucers predated the first widely reported UFO sighting in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO craze began with the Kenneth Arnold sighting on June 24, 1947, when he described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; near Mount Rainier. Within weeks, reports of flying saucer sightings became common, including the Roswell incident in 1947. In 1950, influential books by Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, and Gerald Heard proposed the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media speculation ran rampant, especially during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. By 1953, intelligence officials worried that genuine incursions by enemy aircraft could be lost in a flood of UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force began investigating UFO reports through Project Sign, followed by Project Grudge and Project Blue Book. In the late 1950s, public pressure mounted for declassification of UFO records, but the CIA resisted. Official U.S. Air Force interest in UFO reports ended in 1969 after the Condon Report concluded that further investigation was not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became part of American popular culture&amp;rsquo;s obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. In 1961, the Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gained notoriety. In 1966, 5% of Americans reported seeing something they thought was a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention increased with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, funded from 2007 to 2012. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream attention to UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims more fully. In May 2022, the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee held congressional hearings on UAPs, the first public hearing on UFO sightings in the US in over 50 years. Another Congressional hearing took place on July 26, 2023, featuring the whistleblower claims of former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls have shown varying levels of belief in UFOs among Americans, with some indicating that a significant percentage believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFOs have been taken up by religious studies scholars, and popular culture has played a significant role in shaping public perception of extraterrestrials.&lt;/p&gt;

No official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known government studies include the Swedish military&amp;rsquo;s ghost rockets investigation (1946â€“1947), Project Blue Book by the USAF (1947â€“1969), Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948â€“1951), Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 by the Battelle Memorial Institute, and the Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s OperaÃ§Ã£o Prato (1977).

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as physical spacecraft occupied by intelligent extraterrestrial organisms or probes designed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature back to the 1960s. Key figures mentioned include French ufologist Jacques VallÃ©e, who used the term in his 1966 book, and French engineer AimÃ© Michel. James E. McDonald and James Harder also used the term in 1968, including during testimony before Congress. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; in 1969 when presenting the findings of the Condon Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical roots of the ETH, tracing it back to earlier concepts such as Percival Lowell&amp;rsquo;s ideas about Martian canals and civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups like NICAP and APRO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34;&gt;Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides examples of early speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a story from 1864 about American geologists discovering an alien-like creature inside an egg-shaped structure. It also discusses H. G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; and the &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; reported in the late 19th century, with some speculating they were from Mars. The section also notes the influence of comic strips, radio, and movie serials like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon on popularizing the idea of alien visitation in spaceships. The 1938 radio broadcast of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; by Orson Welles is mentioned as creating public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34;&gt;The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the events following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting of unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier in June 1947. It notes that Arnold quickly considered the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial. The section mentions the speculation in newspapers about the nature of the objects, including comments from U.S. Senator Glen Taylor and R. DeWitt Miller. It also references Charles Fort&amp;rsquo;s earlier documentation of unidentified flying objects. The section highlights that most people were initially unwilling to conclude the objects were extraterrestrial, with theories such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria being more popular. It cites a Gallup poll from August 1947 showing that most people either had no opinion or believed in a mundane explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-public-opinion&#34;&gt;Evolution of Public Opinion &lt;a href=&#34;#evolution-of-public-opinion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines how public opinion on UFOs and the ETH evolved. It mentions the release of several movies in the early 1950s depicting flying saucers and aliens. It cites a &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt; poll from 1951 indicating that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen man-made aircraft, while only a small percentage believed they had seen an alien craft. By 1957, a quarter of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A Roper poll in 2002 reported that a majority of respondents thought UFOs were real, with nearly half believing they had visited Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion&#34;&gt;Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society founded by George King in 1955 as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses NASA&amp;rsquo;s evolving stance on UAPs. It mentions that in June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP using scientific methods. Kopparapu presented a paper in August 2021 that supported ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-or-government-studies&#34;&gt;Private or Government Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#private-or-government-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details private and governmental studies that have supported the ETH or had members who dissented from official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Estimate of the Situation in 1948, which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation for unexplained cases, but was ordered destroyed. A secret West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s internal review of UFOs is mentioned, with some scientists considering the ETH. The section also notes individuals within Project Blue Book, such as Major Dewey Fournet and consultant J. Allen Hynek, who supported the ETH. Statements from former CIA Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter and Greek physicist Paul Santorini are included. The section also mentions the COMETA report, and Jean-Jacques Velasco&amp;rsquo;s book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34;&gt;Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It states that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien presence on Earth. It notes that no rigorous analysis has ever concluded that UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34;&gt;U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery &lt;a href=&#34;#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the U.S. military&amp;rsquo;s involvement in investigating and debunking UFOs. It mentions the Army Air Forces Intelligence&amp;rsquo;s secret study of saucer reports in 1947 and the formation of Project Sign. It notes that Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Scientific Investigation took interest in UFOs following the 1952 UFO flap. The Robertson Panel, organized by the CIA in 1953, reviewed Blue Book&amp;rsquo;s evidence and recommended a policy of public debunkery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;involvement-of-scientists&#34;&gt;Involvement of Scientists &lt;a href=&#34;#involvement-of-scientists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the scientific community&amp;rsquo;s lack of support for the ETH. It mentions Stephen Hawking&amp;rsquo;s skepticism and quotes Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s warning against self-deception in accepting or rejecting the idea of extraterrestrial visitation. It also quotes Peter A. Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s call for examining other possible theories beyond the ETH. The section presents the results of Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s polls of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and American Astronomical Society members, showing limited support for the ETH. It summarizes J. Allen Hynek&amp;rsquo;s seven key reasons for not accepting the ETH, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34;&gt;Fewer Sightings Despite Camera Phone Technology &lt;a href=&#34;#fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section notes that the proliferation of smartphone camera technology has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, which has called into question the claimed phenomenology of UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa-1&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section states NASA&amp;rsquo;s official position as of 2006, which is that the ETH lacks empirical evidence. It quotes David Morrison&amp;rsquo;s statements that no one has ever found a single artifact or convincing evidence for alien visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cia&#34;&gt;CIA &lt;a href=&#34;#cia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions the CIA&amp;rsquo;s organization of the Robertson Panel in 1953 to debunk the data collected by Project Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-white-house-position&#34;&gt;Official White House Position &lt;a href=&#34;#official-white-house-position&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents the White House&amp;rsquo;s official response in November 2011 to petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge alien visits and disclose any withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. The response states that the U.S. government has no evidence of life outside our planet or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Counter Critique of the Official Position: Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the concept of a conspiracy of silence or official cover-up to conceal information about UFOs. It mentions James Harder&amp;rsquo;s argument in 1968 that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs but had been suppressed. It cites a 1971 survey showing that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs than believed in the existence of UFOs or the ETH itself. It also mentions comments from former NASA astronauts Gordon Cooper and Brian O&amp;rsquo;Leary about NASA and the government suppressing UFO sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34;&gt;The Roswell Incident (1980 book) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This entry details the 1980 book &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and William Moore, which popularized stories about the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Roswell incident, focusing on the events of 1947 and the renewed interest in the story in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;events-of-1947&#34;&gt;Events of 1947 &lt;a href=&#34;#events-of-1947&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection outlines the initial reports of unusual debris recovered near Roswell Army Air Field in July 1947, amidst a broader wave of &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; sightings. It mentions Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting, the initial press release by Roswell Army Air Field, and the Army&amp;rsquo;s subsequent retraction, claiming the object was a weather balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roswell-revisited&#34;&gt;Roswell revisited &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-revisited&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection highlights the resurgence of interest in the Roswell story in 1978, sparked by an interview with retired lieutenant colonel Jesse Marcel, who claimed the debris he retrieved was of extraterrestrial origin. Stanton Friedman, a ufologist, is also mentioned in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authors&#34;&gt;Authors &lt;a href=&#34;#authors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides background information on the authors of the book, Charles Berlitz and William Moore. It notes Berlitz&amp;rsquo;s previous success with &lt;em&gt;The Bermuda Triangle&lt;/em&gt;, a book that popularized the Bermuda Triangle mystery. It also mentions their collaboration on &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt;, which promoted the Philadelphia Experiment conspiracy theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents &lt;a href=&#34;#contents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the book&amp;rsquo;s central argument: that an extraterrestrial craft crashed near Roswell while observing nuclear weapons activity, and that the US government engaged in a cover-up. It mentions accounts of debris described as &amp;ldquo;nothing made on this earth&amp;rdquo; and includes testimonies from Bill Brazel, Floyd Proctor, and Walt Whitman Jr. It also introduces the idea that the debris shown in photos with Marcel was substituted as part of a cover-up. The section also notes that the authors claimed to have interviewed over 90 witnesses, but only a fraction of their testimonies appear in the book. The incarceration of Mac Brazel is also mentioned. The section also notes that the book elevated Marcel&amp;rsquo;s narrative above that of Cavitt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-bodies&#34;&gt;Alien bodies &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-bodies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the book&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the &amp;ldquo;Barnett Legend,&amp;rdquo; involving Grady &amp;ldquo;Barney&amp;rdquo; Barnett and archaeology students encountering wreckage and &amp;ldquo;alien bodies&amp;rdquo; on the Plains of San Agustin, far from the initial Roswell crash site. It also mentions the conflation of the Roswell incident with the Aztec, New Mexico, UFO incident, a hoax promoted by Frank Scully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the critical reception of &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt;, noting that some critics deemed it &amp;ldquo;a collection of wild hearsay&amp;rdquo; and questioned the authenticity of the Majestic 12 documents, pointing fingers at Moore. It also notes that the book did not achieve the commercial success its authors anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions Moore&amp;rsquo;s later admission at a MUFON conference in 1989 that he had engaged in &amp;ldquo;disinformation&amp;rdquo; activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-views&#34;&gt;Modern views &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the 1993 inquiry by the General Accounting Office in response to US congressman Steven Schiff, and the subsequent 1994 Air Force report concluding that the recovered material was likely debris from Project Mogul, a military surveillance program using high-altitude balloons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-the-united-states&#34;&gt;List of Alleged UFO Sightings in the United States &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-the-united-states&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a comprehensive list of alleged UFO sightings in the United States, presented in a tabular format. Each entry includes the date, city, state, a link to a main article if available, and a brief description of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;table-of-sightings&#34;&gt;Table of Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#table-of-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This table details numerous alleged UFO sightings across the United States, spanning from the late 19th century to recent years. Key information includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Sightings:&lt;/strong&gt; Reports from the late 1800s, such as the 1865 Cadotte Pass incident in Montana involving a trapper&amp;rsquo;s account of a crashed craft with hieroglyphics, and the 1896-1897 mystery airship sightings across multiple states. The Aurora, Texas, UFO incident in 1897 is also noted, where residents claimed an airship crashed and an alien pilot was buried in the local cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
