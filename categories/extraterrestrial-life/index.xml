      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the Grey alien image. These beings have become an archetypal representation of intelligent non-human creatures and extraterrestrial life in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are generally described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin and reduced or absent external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. They have disproportionately large heads, no hair, and small openings for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their most striking feature is their large, opaque, black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection elaborates on the physical appearance of Greys. They are typically depicted as grey-skinned, small humanoids with reduced or absent external human body parts. Their bodies are elongated, with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from humans. They have unusually large heads in proportion to their bodies, no hair, and no noticeable outer ears or noses. They are almost always shown with very large, opaque, black eyes, without eye whites, and are frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains the connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system. The association originated with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed to have been shown a map displaying the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system and nearby stars. Fish created a model from Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and determined that the stars marked as the aliens&amp;rsquo; home were Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype. Descriptions of beings similar to Greys predate claims of encounters with them. H.G. Wells described humans with similar features in his writings from the late 19th century. Aleister Crowley described a meeting with a similar entity named Lam as early as 1917. Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, described similar aliens in his 1933 science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the literary and occult origins of the Grey alien archetype. In 1893, H.G. Wells described humanity&amp;rsquo;s future appearance as lacking mouths, noses, or hair, and with large heads. In 1895, Wells depicted the Eloi in similar terms in &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. As early as 1917, Aleister Crowley described a meeting with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, similar in appearance to a modern Grey. In 1933, Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, published &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;, describing extraterrestrials with grey fabric clothes, short stature, big bald heads, and large, dark, gleaming eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case and its role in popularizing the Grey alien archetype. Newspaper reports of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1965 made the archetype famous. The Hills claimed that in 1961, grey-skinned humanoid alien beings abducted them and took them to a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield.&amp;rdquo; Carl Sagan echoed Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s suspicions, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses how Greys became an integral part of ufology and extraterrestrial-related folklore after the Hills&amp;rsquo; encounter. According to journalist C.D.B. Bryan, 73% of all reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. In the early 1980s, Greys were linked to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published the book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, describing his alleged close encounters with Greys and other extraterrestrial beings. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu described &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; on French television. In 1995, Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage depicting the autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection examines the role of Greys in alien abduction claims and ufology. Greys are often involved in alien abduction claims, making up about 50% of reports in Australia, 73% in the United States, 48% in continental Europe, and around 12% in the United Kingdom. These reports include two distinct groups of Greys that differ in height. Abduction claims are often described as extremely traumatic. The eyes are often a focus of abduction claims, with Greys staring into the eyes of abductees when conducting mental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents neurologist Steven Novella&amp;rsquo;s theory that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with their distinctive features representing everything that modern humans traditionally link with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection introduces Frederick V. Malmstrom&amp;rsquo;s idea that Greys are actually residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom reconstructs the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face based on our best understanding of early-childhood sensation and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s argument that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be credible as a representation of an alien from a world with different environmental and ecological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection mentions alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of alleged Grey aliens, including the interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the prevalence of Grey aliens in popular culture. Depictions of Grey aliens have appeared in numerous films and television shows, supplanting the previously popular little green men. Examples include Ultraman, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Babylon 5, Stargate, and South Park. During the 1990s, plotlines wherein Greys were linked to conspiracy theories became common, such as in The X-Files. Other examples include the XCOM video game franchise, Dark Skies, and American Dad!. The 2011 film Paul tells the story of a Grey named Paul who attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; frequent presence in science fiction pop culture to the US government deliberately inserting the stereotypical Grey alien image into mainstream media. Child abduction by Greys is a key plot point in the 2013 film, Dark Skies. Greys appear in Syfy&amp;rsquo;s 2021 science fiction dramedy series Resident Alien. The Greys appear as the main antagonistic faction in the 2023 independent game Greyhill Incident.&lt;/p&gt;
