      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34;&gt;Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aztec crashed saucer hoax refers to an alleged flying saucer crash that supposedly occurred in 1948 near Aztec, New Mexico. The story, initially popularized by journalist Frank Scully, was later exposed as a fraud perpetrated by Silas M. Newton and Leo A. Gebauer. Despite its debunking, some ufologists have attempted to revive the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;story&#34;&gt;Story &lt;a href=&#34;#story&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the original narrative of the alleged crash. According to Frank Scully&amp;rsquo;s account, based on information from Newton and Gebauer, a 99-foot diameter aerial craft containing sixteen humanoid bodies was recovered by the military in Hart Canyon, near Aztec, New Mexico, in March 1948. Scully claimed the craft and others captured by the government originated from Venus and operated using &amp;ldquo;magnetic principles.&amp;rdquo; The occupants supposedly carried concentrated food wafers and &amp;ldquo;heavy water.&amp;rdquo; Martin Gardner criticized Scully&amp;rsquo;s account as scientifically unsound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hoax&#34;&gt;Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section exposes the fraudulent nature of the Aztec saucer crash story. Silas Newton and Leo A. Gebauer, while traveling through Aztec, attempted to sell &amp;ldquo;doodlebugs&amp;rdquo; for finding oil, gas, and gold, claiming they were based on alien technology from the crashed saucer. J. P. Cahn of the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; exposed their claims by revealing a sample of &amp;ldquo;alien metal&amp;rdquo; to be ordinary aluminum. Frank Scully published their story in &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; and later in his book &lt;em&gt;Behind the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;. The hoax was fully exposed in &lt;em&gt;True&lt;/em&gt; magazine in 1952 and 1956, leading to Newton and Gebauer&amp;rsquo;s conviction for fraud in 1953 after millionaire Herman Flader pressed charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;influence-on-ufology&#34;&gt;Influence on ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#influence-on-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the impact of the hoax on the field of ufology. Initially discredited, the Aztec story resurfaced in the late 1970s. Leonard Stringfield claimed the incident was real and the craft was one of many captured by the U.S. military. Accounts of the Roswell crash later incorporated the Aztec story, alleging the craft was impervious to heat and contained humanoid bodies between 36 and 42 inches tall. Ufologists claim the military removed all evidence, including the bodies, to Hangar 18 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Robert Spencer Carr also claimed alien bodies recovered near Aztec were stored at &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fbi-memo&#34;&gt;FBI memo &lt;a href=&#34;#fbi-memo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the &amp;ldquo;Hottel memo&amp;rdquo; found in the FBI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Vault&amp;rdquo; website. The memo, written by FBI agent Guy Hottel to J. Edgar Hoover, recounts a story about a crashed saucer and alien bodies. The memo&amp;rsquo;s details trace back to a January 6, 1950, article in &lt;em&gt;the Wyandotte Echo&lt;/em&gt;, a Kansas City, Kansas, legal newspaper, which in turn related the account of a local car salesman and radio station advertising manager. The FBI issued a press release in 2013 clarifying that the memo was a second- or third-hand claim never investigated by the bureau and possibly related to the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section mentions the Aztec UFO Symposium, a fundraiser run by the Aztec, New Mexico, library from 1997 to 2011, inspired by the alleged incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Morristown UFO hoax</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_c15929135709/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;2009-morristown-ufo-hoax&#34;&gt;2009 Morristown UFO Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#2009-morristown-ufo-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 Morristown UFO hoax refers to a series of events involving mysterious red lights observed in the sky near Morristown, New Jersey, starting on January 5, 2009. These lights were subsequently seen on four other nights in January and February. The events were later revealed to be a hoax perpetrated by Joe Rudy and Chris Russo, who described it as a social experiment designed to expose the pseudoscience of ufology and highlight the unreliability of eyewitness accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hoax&#34;&gt;Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial sightings and reactions to the mysterious red lights. Two men, later identified as the hoaxers Rudy and Russo, claimed to have seen the lights while driving in Morris Plains and even gave a fictitious account to &lt;em&gt;News 12 New Jersey&lt;/em&gt;. A family in Hanover Township also reported seeing the lights, with Paul Hurley, a pilot, stating they were not planes. A Morristown resident described an L-shaped formation, and Hanover Township&amp;rsquo;s health officer noted the lights&amp;rsquo; unusual movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;initial-explanations&#34;&gt;Initial Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Rudy and Russo revealed their involvement, various explanations for the lights were proposed, ranging from extraterrestrial craft to secret military projects. The Morristown police suggested they were road flares attached to helium balloons, a claim disputed by witnesses. Peter Davenport, director of the National UFO Reporting Center, dismissed the possibility of the lights being aircraft. Sky lanterns were also considered as a potential explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;subsequent-hoaxes&#34;&gt;Subsequent Hoaxes &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-hoaxes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the initial incident on January 5, Rudy and Russo repeated the hoax four more times in different parts of Morris County, New Jersey. The largest cluster of lights was reported on February 17, with nine red lights traveling in formation. This prompted concern from federal authorities, who feared they might pose a threat to flights approaching Newark Liberty International Airport. Witnesses described the lights&amp;rsquo; unusual behavior, and officials contacted various agencies, including the military, FAA, Homeland Security, and the New Jersey State Police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;revealing-the-hoax&#34;&gt;Revealing the Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#revealing-the-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 2009, Rudy and Russo publicly announced that they were responsible for the hoax. They stated their intention was to demonstrate the unreliability of eyewitness accounts and expose the flaws in UFO investigations. They published an article in &lt;em&gt;Skeptic Magazine&lt;/em&gt; detailing how and why they carried out the hoax, including videos of their preparations and the media coverage it generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conviction&#34;&gt;Conviction &lt;a href=&#34;#conviction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the legal consequences faced by Rudy and Russo. Prosecutor Robert Bianchi filed disorderly-person charges against them, criticizing them for wasting police resources and posing potential fire and aviation threats. They plea-bargained and were sentenced to fines of $250 each and 50 hours of community service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;reactions&#34;&gt;Reactions &lt;a href=&#34;#reactions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions to the hoax were mixed. Sharon Begley of &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; praised the hoax for fooling UFO &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; and believers. George Filer, state director for the Mutual UFO Network of New Jersey, criticized the hoaxers for using flares, which could have started a fire. The Center for Inquiry debated the ethics of skeptics using hoaxes to prove a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morristown UFO hoax has been featured in various media, including the American documentary television series &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt;, where host Bill Birnes investigated the January 5, 2009, sighting. truTV also featured the hoax on &lt;em&gt;Best Hoaxes Ever&lt;/em&gt;. In July 2021, Vice Media spotlighted the hoax on &amp;ldquo;Fakes, Frauds and Scammers,&amp;rdquo; with Rudy and Russo narrating the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1967 British flying saucer hoax</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_ca77cd9256e0/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 21:07:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1967-british-flying-saucer-hoax&#34;&gt;1967 British Flying Saucer Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#1967-british-flying-saucer-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1967 British flying saucer hoax involved the supposed landing of six &amp;lsquo;spaceships&amp;rsquo; across Southern England on September 4, 1967. These &amp;lsquo;spacecraft&amp;rsquo; prompted a significant response from the police and army. The objects were described as being 54 inches long, 30 inches wide, and 20 inches deep, weighing 100 pounds, and emitting an electronic noise. The six craft were located along the 51st line of latitude, stretching from the Thames Estuary to the Bristol Channel. Specific locations included Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, Bromley golf course in south London, Winkfield village near Ascot, Welford near Newbury, Chippenham in Wiltshire, and Dial Hill in Clevedon, Somerset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning-and-building-the-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Planning and Building the &amp;lsquo;Spacecraft&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#planning-and-building-the-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hoax was conceived in January 1967 by aircraft engineering apprentices from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough as part of Rag Week. The apprentices constructed the flying saucers from fiberglass halves, covered them in metal, and equipped them with electronic devices to produce eerie sounds when flipped. Each saucer also contained a mixture of flour and water. Teams of two or three transported the saucers to the chosen locations at night, flipped them over to activate the sound, and then left the scene undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;response-from-the-authorities&#34;&gt;Response from the Authorities &lt;a href=&#34;#response-from-the-authorities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the saucers triggered a large-scale response from authorities. Police cordoned off each site, and the British army&amp;rsquo;s southern command, multiple police forces, army bomb disposal units, and RAF helicopters were mobilized. The Ministry of Defence was notified. The army detonated the saucer found in Chippenham, while the one on the Isle of Sheppey was removed by helicopter. Other saucers were sent to the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and the British Aircraft Corporation&amp;rsquo;s guided weapons division. When one of the saucers was drilled into, the mixture inside exploded, covering police officers in foul-smelling slime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Southall and Roger Palmer, both 21 years old, were identified as the pranksters behind the hoax. Their motive was to raise funds during Rag Week. The hoax generated extensive media coverage both in Britain and internationally. The apprentices revealed the hoax on the same day the saucers were found. No legal action was taken against them, and they successfully raised Â£2,000 for charity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jafr alien invasion</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_d7bf74b1dd15/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2024 10:36:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;2010-jordanian-newspaper-prank-the-jafr-alien-invasion&#34;&gt;2010 Jordanian Newspaper Prank: The Jafr Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#2010-jordanian-newspaper-prank-the-jafr-alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the events surrounding a prank published by the Jordanian newspaper &lt;em&gt;Al-Ghad&lt;/em&gt; on April 1, 2010. The prank involved a fabricated story about UFOs landing near the town of Jafr, Jordan, and the panic that ensued among the town&amp;rsquo;s residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article on the front page of &lt;em&gt;Al-Ghad&lt;/em&gt; claimed that UFOs had landed in the desert near Jafr, and the &amp;ldquo;pilots&amp;rdquo; were described as 3-meter-tall creatures. The story also stated that communications were disrupted by the UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;details-of-the-prank-and-reaction&#34;&gt;Details of the Prank and Reaction &lt;a href=&#34;#details-of-the-prank-and-reaction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story elaborated on the alien landing, describing how the town was illuminated by the flying saucers at night, causing residents to flee into the streets. The hoax caused widespread fear in Jafr, leading parents to keep their children home from school. The mayor of Jafr, Mohammed Mleihan, contacted security authorities and considered ordering an evacuation of the town&amp;rsquo;s 13,000 residents. He also expressed the residents&amp;rsquo; fear of an alien attack and considered suing the newspaper for spreading false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apology-and-context&#34;&gt;Apology and Context &lt;a href=&#34;#apology-and-context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper issued a formal apology for the disruption caused by the prank. The editor did not explain why Jafr was chosen as the target of the joke. However, the BBC noted that the area is known for its military bases, which have been used by American soldiers for joint exercises with the Jordanian military and had allegedly housed al-Qaida militants in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-and-cultural-context&#34;&gt;Comparison and Cultural Context &lt;a href=&#34;#comparison-and-cultural-context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prank is compared to the 1938 radio broadcast of &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, which caused panic in the United States. The article emphasizes that April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day jokes are not a common practice in Jordanian newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article cites two sources: a BBC article titled &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Alien invasion&amp;rsquo; April Fools&amp;rsquo; story angers Jordan mayor&amp;rdquo; and a &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; article titled &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Alien invasion&amp;rsquo; April Fools prank causes public panic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;external-links&#34;&gt;External Links &lt;a href=&#34;#external-links&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article provides an external link to the original article in Arabic on the &lt;em&gt;Al-Ghad&lt;/em&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dundy County UFO hoax</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_b31c98c9c76b/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 20:22:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dundy-county-ufo-hoax&#34;&gt;Dundy County UFO Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#dundy-county-ufo-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dundy County UFO hoax was a fabricated story published by the &lt;em&gt;Nebraska State Journal&lt;/em&gt; in 1884. The story detailed the discovery of a cylindrical object by cowboys in Dundy County, Nebraska, near Max, following a supposed meteor crash. The newspaper later admitted the story was a hoax in 1927, though some people still believe the sighting was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;report-and-revelation-of-hoax&#34;&gt;Report and Revelation of Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#report-and-revelation-of-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the original report published by the &lt;em&gt;Nebraska State Journal&lt;/em&gt; on June 8, 1884. It describes how cowboys in Dundy County, near Max, Nebraska, found the remains of a large meteor. One of the cowboys, Alf Williamson, suffered blisters, hair loss, and eyesight damage upon approaching the site. The heat was so intense that the cowboys couldn&amp;rsquo;t investigate further until the next day. They returned with other locals to find a long, cylindrical tube, approximately 50-60 feet long and 10-12 feet in diameter. Rancher John Ellis intended to claim the land. Two days later, the newspaper reported that rain had dissolved the remains into congealed pools of machinery, which then washed away, leaving only a faint, sweetish smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also covers the immediate reaction to the story, noting that it was widely considered a hoax or joke soon after publication and was parodied during the 1884 presidential election campaign. The &lt;em&gt;Laramie Boomerang&lt;/em&gt; initially carried the story but later reported it was a political allegory for the temperance movement. The hoax predates the mass reports of mystery airships in the late 1890s, some of which occurred in Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;em&gt;Nebraska State Journal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 1927 admission, some people still believe the sighting was legitimate. The &lt;em&gt;McCook Gazette&lt;/em&gt; continues to receive inquiries about the event. In 2013, searches in Red Willow County and the reported discovery of a green material fueled further belief in the story&amp;rsquo;s authenticity. Some modern ufologists consider the report a genuine UFO sighting. A 1997 &lt;em&gt;Lincoln Journal Star&lt;/em&gt; article listed the Dundy County sighting as one of the earliest in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
