      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-nation&#34;&gt;Alien Nation &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-nation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; is an American science fiction media franchise created by Rockne S. O&amp;rsquo;Bannon, known for &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt;. The franchise, owned by 20th Century Studios, encompasses film, television, novels, and comics centered around alien refugees living on Earth. It blends science fiction with elements of drama, police procedural, and buddy cop genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting&#34;&gt;Setting &lt;a href=&#34;#setting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise is set in the near future in the United States, specifically starting in 1991. A flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert, revealing the Tenctonese, an extraterrestrial race referred to as &amp;ldquo;Newcomers.&amp;rdquo; These aliens are escaping slavery from a cruel Overseer race. The Tenctonese resemble humans but possess anatomical differences and enhanced physical and intellectual capabilities due to selective breeding. The core concept revolves around the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration into American society, exploring themes of multiculturalism and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;film&#34;&gt;Film &lt;a href=&#34;#film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise began with the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;, released by 20th Century Fox. The film depicts the integration of the Tenctonese refugees, or Newcomers, into human society in Los Angeles. It combines science fiction and police drama elements. The film stars Mandy Patinkin as Sam &amp;ldquo;George&amp;rdquo; Francisco, a Newcomer detective in the Los Angeles Police Department, and James Caan as Matthew Sykes, his initially reluctant human partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television&#34;&gt;Television &lt;a href=&#34;#television&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Fox adapted the film into a television series, also called &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The series follows the same premise as the film, focusing on the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration after their ship crashes on Earth. Eric Pierpoint stars as George Francisco, and Gary Graham as Matthew Sikes. The series explores themes of racism and the treatment of minority ethnic groups. The series ran for one season of 21 episodes and a pilot episode, ending in 1990. Fox abruptly cancelled the series after the season. Beginning in 1994, the network continued the story in five TV movies, which brought back the entire cast. The installments include &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; (1994), &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt; (1995), &lt;em&gt;Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996), &lt;em&gt;The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; (1996), and &lt;em&gt;The Udara Legacy&lt;/em&gt; (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novels&#34;&gt;Novels &lt;a href=&#34;#novels&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pocket Books, a division of Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, published a novel series connected to the franchise starting in 1993. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, known for their work in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, wrote a novel entitled &lt;em&gt;Day of Descent&lt;/em&gt;. Some novels served as prequels to the movie sequels, such as K.W. Jeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Cross of Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a tie-in to the &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; film, and Peter David&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt;, which became one of the sequels of the same name. The novels regularly addressed racism and discrimination with extraterrestrial themes. K. W. Jeter and Barry B. Longyear were regular contributors to the series with novels like, &lt;em&gt;The Change&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slag Like Me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comics&#34;&gt;Comics &lt;a href=&#34;#comics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 1992, Malibu Comics published several comics adapting the &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; storyline. Among the first released titles were &lt;em&gt;The Spartans&lt;/em&gt;, created with the help of author Bill Spangler and illustrator James Tucker, and &lt;em&gt;A Breed Apart&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Steve Jones. Other titles included &lt;em&gt;Public Enemy&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Sandy Carruthers and illustrated by Lowell Cunningham, and a crossover series with the &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; franchise titled &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt; series included four different adventures called &lt;em&gt;Plans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pasts&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pawns&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pains&lt;/em&gt; along with a collector&amp;rsquo;s edition. Other contributors to the series included illustrators Terry Pallott and Leonard Kirk to titles like, &lt;em&gt;The Skin Trade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;remake&#34;&gt;Remake &lt;a href=&#34;#remake&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 25, 2015, Fox announced a remake with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing. On September 9, 2016, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported that Jeff Nichols would write and direct the film. On January 25, 2021, it was announced that Jeff Nichols would remake the film as a ten-part television series. On June 21, 2024, it was reported Nichols was developing an original sci-fi feature film for Paramount instead of an Alien Nation project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dover Demon</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dover-demon&#34;&gt;Dover Demon &lt;a href=&#34;#dover-demon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dover Demon is a creature reportedly sighted in Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the reported sightings of the Dover Demon in April 1977. William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Bartlett, John Baxter, and Abby Brabham, all teenagers at the time, independently reported seeing a strange creature. Bartlett described it as about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth, with a watermelon-shaped head. Baxter reported a similar sighting on Miller Hill Road, and Brabham claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue. The teenagers drew sketches of the creature, with Bartlett swearing on a stack of Bibles to the accuracy of his drawing. The locations of the sightings, when plotted on a map, formed a straight line over 2 miles. The sightings became public in May, and a local investigator noted similarities to the creatures in the Kellyâ€“Hopkinsville encounter. The Mutual UFO Network also investigated the sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-explanations&#34;&gt;Possible explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the Dover Demon sightings. One suggestion is that the creature was a foal or a moose calf. Skeptic Joe Nickell proposes that the creature was likely a snowy owl, citing its size and plumage, which could reflect yellow headlights. The &amp;ldquo;long spindly arms&amp;rdquo; could be the partially opened wings of the owl. Police suggested the sightings were a school vacation hoax. Ben Radford suggests the sightings may have been influenced by the release of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the Dover Demon&amp;rsquo;s appearances in popular culture. It was featured in an episode of the American horror television series &lt;em&gt;Lost Tapes&lt;/em&gt; on Animal Planet in 2009. The Dover Demon appears as a character in the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;, where it can see into the future, and in &lt;em&gt;The Perhapanauts&lt;/em&gt;. It also made appearances in &lt;em&gt;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&lt;/em&gt;. A Dover Demon appears in the webcomic &lt;em&gt;Gunnerkrigg Court&lt;/em&gt;. In the manga series &lt;em&gt;Dandadan&lt;/em&gt;, an alien known as Dover Demon takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien.&lt;/p&gt;
