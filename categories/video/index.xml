      <title>Uncontacted peoples</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_87f3a49b74f0/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_87f3a49b74f0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;uncontacted-peoples&#34;&gt;Uncontacted Peoples &lt;a href=&#34;#uncontacted-peoples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncontacted peoples are Indigenous groups who live without sustained contact with neighboring communities and the world community. They choose to remain isolated, and are referred to as indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. Estimates suggest there are between 100 and 200 uncontacted tribes, totaling up to 10,000 individuals, primarily located in South America, especially northern Brazil. Knowledge about these groups is mainly gathered from neighboring Indigenous communities and aerial footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition&#34;&gt;Definition &lt;a href=&#34;#definition&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;uncontacted peoples&amp;rdquo; refers to Indigenous groups who have remained largely isolated, maintaining their traditional lifestyles independently from political or governmental entities. While most Indigenous groups have had some form of contact due to European exploration and colonization, &amp;ldquo;uncontacted&amp;rdquo; signifies a lack of sustained contact with the majority of non-Indigenous society today. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights calls them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; defined by their rejection of contact with outsiders, including those who previously had contact but chose to return to isolation. These groups are viewed as contemporaries of modernity, not relics of the past. A 2009 United Nations report also includes &amp;ldquo;peoples in initial contact&amp;rdquo; who are beginning to integrate into mainstream society. International organizations emphasize their agency by calling them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in isolation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; also known as &amp;ldquo;hidden peoples&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uncontacted tribes.&amp;rdquo; Historically, European colonial ideas about uncontacted peoples were influenced by the search for Prester John and the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying them as &amp;ldquo;lost tribes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relations-with-outsiders&#34;&gt;Relations with Outsiders &lt;a href=&#34;#relations-with-outsiders&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International organizations emphasize protecting indigenous peoples&amp;rsquo; lands and environment, preventing exploitation and abuse, and avoiding contact to prevent the spread of modern diseases. Historic exploitation has led governments to grant legal protection and land rights to uncontacted peoples, such as in the Vale do Javari in Brazil and North Sentinel Island in India. In 1961, British explorer Richard Mason was killed by the PanarÃ¡ tribe. Contact in 1973, when the BR-163 road was built through their territory, led to disease and environmental degradation, killing over 250 of the 350 PanarÃ¡ members within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contention often arises from governments&amp;rsquo; desire to extract natural resources. In Brazil, the government attempted assimilation in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was created, securing protected lands. In Colombia, contact with the Nukak tribe by an evangelical group led to respiratory infections, clashes with drug traffickers, and the death of over half the tribe, resulting in government relocation and poverty. Exploitation for lumbering, ranching, oil prospecting, and poaching poses significant dangers. Former Peruvian President Alan GarcÃ­a claimed uncontacted groups were a &amp;ldquo;fabrication of environmentalists.&amp;rdquo; In 2016, a Chinese mining subsidiary in Bolivia ignored signs of encroaching on uncontacted tribes. Missionaries can also cause great damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Acre Indians contacted the Brazilian government due to threats from cocaine traffickers, indicating awareness of the outside world and strategic decisions to avoid contact. Satellite images show tribes migrating away from roads and logging. Indigenous rights activists advocate for leaving isolated peoples alone to protect their self-determination. FUNAI collaborates with experts to make controlled initial contact, operating trading posts for metal tools and cooking instruments, preventing conflicts, and delivering vaccinations. However, FUNAI reported receiving only 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, FUNAI released videos and images of tribes to raise public awareness and protect them from commercial pressures, investigating a possible mass homicide against the Flecheiros tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Human Rights Council (2009) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (2013) introduced guidelines including the right to choose self-isolation. Reports of &amp;ldquo;human safaris&amp;rdquo; in India&amp;rsquo;s Andaman Islands and the Peruvian Amazon, where tourists seek to view uncontacted peoples, are controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;by-region&#34;&gt;By Region &lt;a href=&#34;#by-region&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;india&#34;&gt;India &lt;a href=&#34;#india&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sentinelese&#34;&gt;Sentinelese &lt;a href=&#34;#sentinelese&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sentinelese people of North Sentinel Island reject contact, often with lethal force. Their language differs significantly from other Andaman languages, suggesting millennia of isolation. Experts consider them the most isolated people in the world. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997. In 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary, was killed while illegally visiting the island. In 2025, a US citizen was arrested for making an unauthorized landing on the island. Survival International condemned these actions, noting the vulnerability of uncontacted peoples to contact-induced diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shompen&#34;&gt;Shompen &lt;a href=&#34;#shompen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shompen are the Indigenous people of Great Nicobar Island, with an estimated population of 300 in 2001. They practice a hunter-gatherer economy. Survival International identifies them as one of the most isolated peoples, with most refusing interactions with outsiders. The proposed Great Nicobar Development Plan, including an airport, international port, and industrial park, threatens their way of life. In February 2024, 39 genocide experts warned that the development would be a &amp;ldquo;death sentence&amp;rdquo; for the Shompen due to increased population and exposure to outside diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;south-america&#34;&gt;South America &lt;a href=&#34;#south-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bolivia&#34;&gt;Bolivia &lt;a href=&#34;#bolivia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toromona are an uncontacted people living near the Madidi and Heath Rivers. The government has created a protected area within Madidi National Park for them. Among the Ayoreo people of the Gran Chaco, a small number of uncontacted nomadic hunter-gatherers reside in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park. Pacahuaras are believed to be living in voluntary isolation in Pando Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brazil&#34;&gt;Brazil &lt;a href=&#34;#brazil&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the 1970s, Brazil attempted to move people on commercially cultivatable lands. In 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was established, and the Vale do Javari was declared perpetually sealed off. In 2007, FUNAI reported 67 uncontacted Indigenous peoples, up from 40 in 2005. The AwÃ¡ people live in the eastern Amazon rainforest, with approximately 350 members, 100 of whom are uncontacted. Their tribe is at risk due to conflicts with logging interests. The Kawahiva live in northern Mato Grosso, constantly moving and known primarily from physical evidence. In 2013, the government released video of the Kawahiva filmed in 2011. In 2025, FUNAI confirmed that the demarcation of the Kawahiva do Rio Pardo territory will happen by the end of 2025. The Korubu live in the lower Vale do Javari. The Flecheiros (&amp;ldquo;arrow people&amp;rdquo;) also live in the Vale do Javari. Other tribes may include the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and the HimarimÃ£.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, two brothers of the Piripkura tribe initiated contact with FUNAI after their fire went out, becoming the focus of the documentary &lt;em&gt;Piripkura&lt;/em&gt;. Another man, the &amp;ldquo;Man of the Hole,&amp;rdquo; lived alone on 8,000 hectares, digging hundreds of holes. He was found dead in his dwelling in August 2022. Since 2021, uncontacted peoples in Brazil have been threatened by illegal land grabbers, loggers, and gold miners. The government of Jair Bolsonaro signaled its intention to develop the Amazon and reduce Indigenous reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;colombia&#34;&gt;Colombia &lt;a href=&#34;#colombia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is regarded as offering maximum protection to uncontacted Indigenous people through tribal reserves and strict patrolling. The Nukak people are nomadic hunter-gatherers living between the Guaviare and InÃ­rida rivers. Groups, including the Carabayo, Yuri, and PassÃ©, reside in RÃ­o PurÃ© National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ecuador&#34;&gt;Ecuador &lt;a href=&#34;#ecuador&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two isolated Indigenous peoples of Ecuador live in the Amazon region: the Tagaeri and the Taromenane, both eastern Huaorani peoples living in Yasuni National Park. These semi-nomadic people live in small groups, subsisting on hunting, gathering, and some crops. Since 2007, national policy mandates untouchability, self-determination, equality, and no contact. In 2013, more than 20 Taromenane were killed by Waorani, another Huaorani group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paraguay&#34;&gt;Paraguay &lt;a href=&#34;#paraguay&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 100 Ayoreo people, some of whom are in the Totobiegosode tribe, live uncontacted in the forest. They are nomadic hunter-gatherers in Amotocodie. They are the last uncontacted peoples south of the Amazon Basin, threatened by illegal deforestation. Brazilian company Yaguarete PorÃ¡ S.A. is converting their ancestral territory into cattle ranching land. The Union of Ayoreo Natives of Paraguay is working for their protection, with support from the Iniciativa Amotocodie. In 2021, the Ayoreo appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to save their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;peru&#34;&gt;Peru &lt;a href=&#34;#peru&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nomole (Mashco-Piro) are nomadic Arawak-speaking hunter-gatherers who inhabit ManÃº National Park. In 1998, their number was estimated at 100 to 250. They speak a dialect of the Piro languages. Amid incursions on their land, the tribe has made it clear they do not wish to be contacted. In July 2024, video and images of dozens of uncontact&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pentagon-ufo-videos&#34;&gt;Pentagon UFO Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#pentagon-ufo-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the widely publicized cockpit instrumentation display videos from US Navy fighter jets, often characterized as UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the videos, referencing historical UFO photographs and events. It details the initial incident on November 14, 2004, involving Commander David Fravor of the USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; Carrier Strike Group investigating radar indications of a possible target off the coast of southern California. The USS &lt;em&gt;Princeton&lt;/em&gt; had been tracking unusual aircraft for two weeks prior to the incident. Fravor&amp;rsquo;s account of encountering a white, oval object hovering above an ocean disturbance is highlighted, as well as the observations of other pilots. It also mentions Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, who recorded the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; video and coined the term &amp;ldquo;Tic Tac&amp;rdquo; to describe the object. The section also mentions the 2014-2015 incidents involving fighter pilots associated with the USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; carrier strike group operating off the East Coast of the United States, during which the GIMBAL and GOFAST videos were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-videos&#34;&gt;Release of Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the public release of the videos. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on the incidents and published the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL&amp;rdquo; videos in December 2017, while the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published the &amp;ldquo;GOFAST&amp;rdquo; video. Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, provided the videos to the press. Luis Elizondo, the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy. In September 2019, the Pentagon confirmed the videos were made by naval aviators. On April 27, 2020, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. In February 2020, the United States Navy confirmed that intelligence briefings have been provided to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021-release&#34;&gt;2021 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2021-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the release of additional footage in 2021. In April 2021, the Pentagon confirmed the authenticity of a video taken by Navy personnel aboard USS &lt;em&gt;Russell&lt;/em&gt; in 2019, showing a triangular object. Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acorn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metallic blimp&amp;rdquo;. In May 2021, a second video recorded by Navy personnel aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Omaha&lt;/em&gt; on July 15, 2019, was confirmed and is under review by the UAP Task Force. The video purportedly shows a spherical object flying over the ocean. Mick West commented on the video, suggesting it could simply be a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2023-release&#34;&gt;2023 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2023-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the release of additional videos in 2023. In early 2023, an object was filmed by two MQ-9 drones in South Asia, initially believed to be anomalous but later identified as a commuter aircraft. On May 31, 2023, Sean M. Kirkpatrick shared an infrared video recorded in the western United States in 2021, which AARO concluded to be commercial aircraft. On April 19, 2023, the Pentagon released another video featuring MQ-9 drone footage from the Middle East depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon resembling a small &amp;ldquo;metallic orb&amp;rdquo;. Sean M. Kirkpatrick briefed a Senate Armed Services subcommittee on the video, but stated they are unable to fully identify anything from the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-explanations&#34;&gt;Potential Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the aerial phenomena recorded in the videos. As of 2020, the Department of Defense characterizes the phenomena as &amp;ldquo;unidentified&amp;rdquo;. Skeptical explanations include instrument malfunction, human observational error, or common aircraft. Mick West cautioned that believers in &amp;ldquo;alien disclosure&amp;rdquo; are &amp;ldquo;encroaching on these real issues of UAPs&amp;rdquo;. Adam Frank speculated that the UFOs could be drones deployed by rivals like Russia and China. Thomas Bania speculated that they could be some form of electronic warfare fielded by China or Russia. The US Navy updated its reporting guidelines for unexplained aerial observations. Senator Marco Rubio expressed concern that the UFOs may be Chinese or Russian technology. Admiral Gary Roughead said that most assessments were inconclusive. Jeff Wise suggests advancements in electronic warfare could deceive sensors. In 2023, David Fravor testified under oath regarding the USS Nimitz sighting, stating that the technology was far superior to anything the US had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2021-ufo-report&#34;&gt;June 2021 UFO Report &lt;a href=&#34;#june-2021-ufo-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the preliminary report on UAPs released by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on June 25, 2021. The report came to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, citing a lack of sufficient data. Some UAPs appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics, including high velocity and maneuverability. The report indicated that the UAP recordings probably were of physical objects and proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; category. The report raised concerns about safety and security issues and indicated that investigation of the topic would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34;&gt;FOI Request by The Black Vault &lt;a href=&#34;#foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details a Freedom of Information request made by The Black Vault for the release of more video footage. The government confirmed it had more footage but refused to release it, citing concerns for national security.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;rods-optical-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Rods (Optical Phenomenon) &lt;a href=&#34;#rods-optical-phenomenon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rods, also known as skyfish, air rods, or solar entities, are elongated visual artifacts that appear in photographic images and video recordings. While cryptozoologists and ufologists consider them paranormal, most optical analyses conclude they are insects moving across the frame during capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optical-analysis&#34;&gt;Optical Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#optical-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the scientific explanations for the &amp;ldquo;rod&amp;rdquo; phenomenon. Robert Todd Carroll, consulting with entomologist Doug Yanega, identified rods as images of flying insects captured over several wing-beating cycles on video. This creates the illusion of a single, elongated body. A report by &amp;ldquo;The Straight Dope&amp;rdquo; also attributes rods to tricks of light and motion blur due to long exposure times when recording flying insects. The section emphasizes that claims of extraordinary or alien origins are often attributed to imagination or hoaxes. China Central Television (CCTV) aired a documentary debunking rods, revealing them to be ordinary insects captured by surveillance cameras. Scientists at Tonghua Zhenguo Pharmaceutical Company in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, captured &amp;ldquo;rods&amp;rdquo; in nets, finding them to be moths and other insects. UFO investigator Robert Sheaffer, after attending a lecture by Jose Escamilla, concluded that some &amp;ldquo;rods&amp;rdquo; were insects moving rapidly, while others were blurred bird wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the paranormal interpretations of rods, particularly those promoted by Jose Escamilla. Escamilla claimed to have filmed the first rods on March 19, 1994, in Roswell, New Mexico, while attempting to film a UFO. He subsequently created videos and gave lectures promoting his claims of rods being alien life forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section contains a footnote clarifying that claims of rods being extraordinary creatures are often exploited by unscrupulous individuals for profit, according to &amp;ldquo;Straight Dope&amp;rdquo; staff.&lt;/p&gt;
