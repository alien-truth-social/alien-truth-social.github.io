&lt;p&gt;A British science fiction television series that aired from 1970 to 1971, focusing on Earth&amp;rsquo;s defense against an alien invasion in the then-future of 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise &lt;a href=&#34;#premise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Earth is under threat from aliens from a dying planet who are abducting humans for their organs. SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation), a secret international military agency operating under the guise of a movie studio, is formed to defend Earth. SHADO utilizes advanced technology, including a space intruder detection satellite (SID), lunar interceptors, a submarine/aircraft called Skydiver, and ground-based SHADO Mobiles. The aliens are humanoid, requiring a green oxygenated liquid and special contact lenses. Their UFOs can travel faster than light but have limited time in Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series features a large ensemble cast with frequent changes. Ed Bishop as Commander Ed Straker is the only actor to appear in every episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;episodes&#34;&gt;Episodes &lt;a href=&#34;#episodes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 26 episodes were broadcast in a non-chronological order by ITV. The list provides the original ATV (Midlands) broadcast order, along with director, writer, original air date, and production code. Episode titles include &amp;ldquo;Identified,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Exposed,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Cat with Ten Lives,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Conflict,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;A Question of Priorities,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Long Sleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different viewing orders exist, including production order, ATV broadcast order, and recommended orders by UFO Series, Fanderson, and ITC. A table compares these different orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lew Grade approached Gerry Anderson to create a live-action TV series, resulting in &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt;. The series was influenced by UFO sightings and Christiaan Barnard&amp;rsquo;s transplant operations. Sylvia Anderson designed the costumes, including the purple wigs for female Moonbase staff. The Harlington-Straker Studio was the actual studio where the series was filmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filming began in April 1969 at MGM-British Studios, then moved to Pinewood Studios in June 1970. George Sewell and Gabrielle Drake left after the studio change. Harry Baird and Peter Gordeno also left the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;costumes&#34;&gt;Costumes &lt;a href=&#34;#costumes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female Moonbase personnel wore purple wigs, silver catsuits, and heavy eye makeup for a futuristic look. Ed Bishop initially bleached his hair, then wore a white wig. Other male characters also wore wigs. Only two alien suits were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;special-effects&#34;&gt;Special effects &lt;a href=&#34;#special-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Meddings supervised the special effects, using techniques like double-walled visors and underwater effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vehicle-design&#34;&gt;Vehicle design &lt;a href=&#34;#vehicle-design&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Meddings and Mike Trim designed the vehicles. The gull-winged cars were originally built for &lt;em&gt;Doppelgänger&lt;/em&gt;. The blue SHADO Jeeps were built on Mini Moke chassis. Few original props and miniatures have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast&#34;&gt;Broadcast &lt;a href=&#34;#broadcast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters were unsure if &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; was for adults or children. In the UK, episodes were shown in the late afternoon and Saturday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews of &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; are mixed. Some praise the visuals, music, and costumes, while others criticize the writing and pacing. Some reviews note the series&amp;rsquo; mix of adult themes and science fiction elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aborted-second-series&#34;&gt;Aborted second series &lt;a href=&#34;#aborted-second-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITC commissioned a second series, &lt;em&gt;UFO 2&lt;/em&gt;, set entirely on the Moon. However, when ratings dropped, ITC cancelled the plans. Gerry Anderson then created &lt;em&gt;Space: 1999&lt;/em&gt; from the pre-production work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;merchandise&#34;&gt;Merchandise &lt;a href=&#34;#merchandise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series generated a range of toys, including Dinky die-cast vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;compilation-films&#34;&gt;Compilation films &lt;a href=&#34;#compilation-films&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several episodes were compiled into films, including &lt;em&gt;Invasion: UFO&lt;/em&gt;. Italian producers also created compilation films with mixed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel 5 and ITC released VHS collections. The complete series was released on DVD in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;proposed-feature-film&#34;&gt;Proposed feature film &lt;a href=&#34;#proposed-feature-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a feature film adaptation was announced, but it did not enter production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories set in the &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; universe have appeared in novels, comics, and video games. Julian Gollop cited &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; as an influence for &lt;em&gt;UFO: Enemy Unknown&lt;/em&gt;. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto drew inspiration from &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; for character designs in &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;translations&#34;&gt;Translations &lt;a href=&#34;#translations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article discusses various conspiracy theories surrounding Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), particularly the idea that governments, especially the United States government, are suppressing evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology. It also explores the evolution of these theories, their proponents, and their presence in popular culture and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the core concept of UFO conspiracy theories: governments concealing evidence of extraterrestrial involvement. It traces the origins of these theories back to pulp science fiction and the &amp;ldquo;lost continent&amp;rdquo; myths. The section highlights Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting as a catalyst for widespread UFO reports and the subsequent speculation about secret technologies. Donald Keyhoe is identified as a key figure in popularizing the idea of a government cover-up. The emergence of the &amp;ldquo;Men in Black&amp;rdquo; concept is also mentioned. The section further explains how UFO conspiracy theories became more prevalent after the Kennedy assassination, linking his death to aliens. The term &amp;ldquo;Cosmic Watergate&amp;rdquo; is introduced to describe the alleged cover-up. The section also mentions the influence of films like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and the introduction of the Roswell incident to a mass audience. The shift from benevolent &amp;ldquo;space brothers&amp;rdquo; to malevolent aliens in the 1980s is discussed, along with the connection of UFO cover-ups to alien abductions, cattle mutilations, and the JFK assassination. The section concludes by noting the resurgence of interest in UFO conspiracy theories in the 1990s and 2017 with Leslie Kean&amp;rsquo;s stories of a Pentagon UFO program.&lt;/p&gt;

It acknowledges the historical and cultural prominence of UFO sightings, particularly after World War II and during the Space Age. It mentions government investigations like Project Blue Book and Project Condign, as well as studies by organizations and individuals. The section emphasizes that these investigations have not confirmed claims of extraterrestrial intelligence or other unconventional explanations for UFOs. It highlights that scientists and skeptical organizations offer prosaic explanations, such as natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. The section also notes that beliefs surrounding UFOs have inspired new religions and that social scientists view the ongoing interest in UFOs as a form of modern folklore and mythology. Benjamin Radford&amp;rsquo;s argument against the feasibility of a long-term, international UFO cover-up is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of people reporting what they believe to be the real experience of being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. Those who claim to have been abducted are called &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; Most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject claims that alien abduction literally occurs as reported. Some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that most abductees are sane and common people, with psychopathology associated only with some cases. Mack noted the detailed nature of some abduction reports and the existence of a subculture with support groups and a mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, etc.). Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the term &amp;ldquo;alien abduction&amp;rdquo; gained widespread attention, some older stories were speculated to be possible cases, dubbed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1896, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them in Stockton, California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1953, an article in &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; questioned whether humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1955, Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported the mysterious disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, with speculation that they were victims of abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 generated widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident was the first in which the claimants described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s and suggested a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became interested in abduction reports in the 1970s and used hypnosis to extract more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980s brought mainstream attention to the subject through works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs, and psychiatrist John E. Mack. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard published a comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees. Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected and that aliens were attempting to create human-alien hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Skeptic Michael Shermer noted that the ubiquity of camera phones increases the burden of evidence for such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; called him &amp;ldquo;a well-meaning man uncritically elaborating on tales of alien abduction, and potentially both cementing and constructing false memories&amp;rdquo;. Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression of claimants helped spread the Grey aliens meme into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. Due to Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief and subsequent promotion of the claims of those he interviewed, his professional reputation suffered, prompting Harvard to review his position in 1994. He retained tenure, but &amp;ldquo;was not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population allege to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although abduction reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental Health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &amp;ldquo;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&amp;rdquo;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking&amp;rdquo;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &amp;ldquo;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism&amp;rdquo;. UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters but also featured demonization of FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering it important to warn the world of such imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS&amp;rsquo;s definition of &lt;em&gt;abductee&lt;/em&gt;, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; through means like hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although different cases vary in detail, some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp;amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time&lt;/strong&gt;. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany&lt;/strong&gt;. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience&amp;rdquo;, accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says: &amp;ldquo;The entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness &amp;ldquo;the Oz Factor&amp;rdquo;. External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings against environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, figures like psychiatrist John E. Mack have argued that many abductees are sane individuals reporting genuine experiences. A subculture has developed around the phenomenon, complete with support groups and a detailed mythos involving various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics) with specific roles and motivations. Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A November 27, 1896, report in &lt;em&gt;The Evening Mail&lt;/em&gt; of Stockton, California, where Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1953 &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; article questioning if humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s 1955 publication &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt;, which reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Antônio Vilas-Boas case in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin. Skeptic Peter Rogerson notes that these cases established a template for later abductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the phenomenon in the 1960s and believed in its actuality, linking abductions to cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became a figurehead of the abductee subculture in the 1970s, using hypnosis to extract details. The 1980s brought mainstream attention through works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack, presenting alien abduction as plausible. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard also published a comparative analysis of alleged abductees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than suspected, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been taken. They proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids, with the most advanced stage known as hubrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of systematic interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer noted that camera phones increase the burden of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, criticized Mack for uncritically elaborating on abduction tales and potentially constructing false memories. Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression helped spread the Grey aliens meme. Despite his esteemed reputation, Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief in abduction claims led to a Harvard review in 1994, where he retained tenure but lost professional credibility among colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. CUFOS defines an abductee as someone taken against their will by non-human beings to an extraterrestrial place or spaceship, subjected to examination or communication, with memory of the experience either conscious or recovered through hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though cases vary, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argues there is a fairly consistent sequence of events in a typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures:&lt;/strong&gt; Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and sometimes simulated behavioral situations, training, testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals, typically telepathically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductees are returned to earth, sometimes in a different location or with new injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany:&lt;/strong&gt; Abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high,&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says the entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated with predetermined procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the experience, such as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place or expectations of something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown.&amp;rdquo; They also report severe anxiety. This period of foreboding can last for days or be absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the experiencer undergoes an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness, called &amp;ldquo;the Oz Factor&amp;rdquo; by British researchers. External sounds cease to have significance, and the experiencer feels introspective and calm. This marks a transition to &amp;ldquo;limited self-willed mobility.&amp;rdquo; Lights appear, sometimes accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the abduction proceeds, claimants say they walk or are levitated into an alien craft, sometimes through solid objects. Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light into the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. These procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge is often taller and of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John G. Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported by abductors, focusing on the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems like the cardiovascular and respiratory systems receive less attention. Abductors do not appear to wear gloves, and terrestrial medicine constants like pills and tongue depressors are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subsequent-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, abductees often report other procedures, including imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; involves viewing screens displaying images intended to provoke emotional responses. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is similar, but the images are projected into the experiencer&amp;rsquo;s mind. &amp;ldquo;Staging&amp;rdquo; involves the abductee playing an active role in a vivid, hallucination-like scenario. &amp;ldquo;Testing&amp;rdquo; involves the experiencer operating a complicated electronic device, often finding they know how to operate it despite initial confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;child-presentation&#34;&gt;Child Presentation &lt;a href=&#34;#child-presentation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abductees sometimes report being subjected&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings about environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that many abductees are sane individuals, with psychopathology only present in some cases. Detailed abduction reports have led to the development of a subculture with support groups and a complex mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types, such as Greys, Reptilians, and Nordics. Some abductees engage in independent research and attribute the lack of wider awareness to extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. One example is Colonel H. G. Shaw&amp;rsquo;s 1896 claim of being harassed by tall, slender humanoids. An article from 1953 asked if flying saucers were kidnapping humans for zoological specimens or vivisection. The 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two landmark cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil during the mid-1950s was an early claim but received limited attention initially. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the phenomenon in the 1960s and linked abductions to cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became a key figure in the abductee subculture in the 1970s, using hypnosis to uncover details of remembered events. The 1980s saw increased mainstream attention, with works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack presenting alien abduction as a plausible experience. Thomas E. Bullard&amp;rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than previously thought, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been abducted. They also proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of widespread interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, alien abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer suggests that the ubiquity of camera phones has increased the burden of evidence, contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, suggested that Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression helped spread the Grey aliens meme. Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. His professional reputation suffered due to his belief and promotion of abduction claims, leading to a Harvard review in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. Early studies found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys suggested 5–6 percent of the general population claim to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While abduction reports are usually made by adults, children sometimes report similar experiences. These reports often share specific details with adult reports, including circumstances, narrative, entities, and aftermaths. Young abductees often have family members who have reported abduction experiences, and family involvement in the military or residence near a military base is also common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that abductees are not different from the general population in terms of psychopathology prevalence. Elizabeth Slater&amp;rsquo;s blind study found abductees prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking,&amp;rdquo; nightmares, and weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally&amp;rsquo;s study concluded that none of the abductees suffered from psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlights links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, and government takeover. He observed the rise of &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism.&amp;rdquo; UFO and abduction stories can be part of stigmatized knowledge narratives. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters, and demonized FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities and may resort to questionable regression therapy. Some espouse conspiracy theories of technological mind control, including implants, to force them to serve a New World Order or for the purposes of the antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

CUFOS defines an abductee as someone taken against their will by non-human beings to an extraterrestrial place or spaceship, subjected to examination or communication, with memories that may be conscious or recovered through hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although cases vary, some UFO researchers argue that there is a fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;: Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp;amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time&lt;/strong&gt;: Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location or with new injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany&lt;/strong&gt;: Abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says that the entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated, with predetermined procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience, such as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place or expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will occur. They also report feeling severe anxiety. Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. External sounds cease to have any significance, and they report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts, lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, often through solid objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge of the operation is often taller than the others and may appear to be of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. The abductors&amp;rsquo; areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems given less attention include the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx, and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the &amp;ldquo;examination.&amp;rdquo; Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives, although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subsequent-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry details the 1994 American science fiction television film &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, also known as &lt;em&gt;Roswell: The U.F.O. Cover-Up&lt;/em&gt;. The film is based on the alleged Roswell UFO incident, which involves the U.S. military&amp;rsquo;s supposed capture of a flying saucer and its alien crew after a crash near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. The film also references other UFOlogy events, including Area 51, alien autopsies, the death of James Forrestal, and Majestic-12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot unfolds through flashbacks at a 30-year reunion of the 509th Operations Group. It centers on Major Jesse Marcel&amp;rsquo;s investigation into strange debris found on a rancher&amp;rsquo;s field in July 1947. Despite being told by his superiors that it was merely a downed weather balloon, Marcel persists in his search for the truth, ultimately uncovering the reality of what occurred. Key figures include Major Jesse Marcel and the setting is Roswell, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-nation&#34;&gt;Alien Nation &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-nation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; is an American science fiction media franchise created by Rockne S. O&amp;rsquo;Bannon, known for &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt;. The franchise, owned by 20th Century Studios, encompasses film, television, novels, and comics centered around alien refugees living on Earth. It blends science fiction with elements of drama, police procedural, and buddy cop genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting&#34;&gt;Setting &lt;a href=&#34;#setting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise is set in the near future in the United States, specifically starting in 1991. A flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert, revealing the Tenctonese, an extraterrestrial race referred to as &amp;ldquo;Newcomers.&amp;rdquo; These aliens are escaping slavery from a cruel Overseer race. The Tenctonese resemble humans but possess anatomical differences and enhanced physical and intellectual capabilities due to selective breeding. The core concept revolves around the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration into American society, exploring themes of multiculturalism and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;film&#34;&gt;Film &lt;a href=&#34;#film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise began with the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;, released by 20th Century Fox. The film depicts the integration of the Tenctonese refugees, or Newcomers, into human society in Los Angeles. It combines science fiction and police drama elements. The film stars Mandy Patinkin as Sam &amp;ldquo;George&amp;rdquo; Francisco, a Newcomer detective in the Los Angeles Police Department, and James Caan as Matthew Sykes, his initially reluctant human partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television&#34;&gt;Television &lt;a href=&#34;#television&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Fox adapted the film into a television series, also called &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The series follows the same premise as the film, focusing on the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration after their ship crashes on Earth. Eric Pierpoint stars as George Francisco, and Gary Graham as Matthew Sikes. The series explores themes of racism and the treatment of minority ethnic groups. The series ran for one season of 21 episodes and a pilot episode, ending in 1990. Fox abruptly cancelled the series after the season. Beginning in 1994, the network continued the story in five TV movies, which brought back the entire cast. The installments include &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; (1994), &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt; (1995), &lt;em&gt;Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996), &lt;em&gt;The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; (1996), and &lt;em&gt;The Udara Legacy&lt;/em&gt; (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novels&#34;&gt;Novels &lt;a href=&#34;#novels&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pocket Books, a division of Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, published a novel series connected to the franchise starting in 1993. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, known for their work in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, wrote a novel entitled &lt;em&gt;Day of Descent&lt;/em&gt;. Some novels served as prequels to the movie sequels, such as K.W. Jeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Cross of Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a tie-in to the &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; film, and Peter David&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt;, which became one of the sequels of the same name. The novels regularly addressed racism and discrimination with extraterrestrial themes. K. W. Jeter and Barry B. Longyear were regular contributors to the series with novels like, &lt;em&gt;The Change&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slag Like Me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comics&#34;&gt;Comics &lt;a href=&#34;#comics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 1992, Malibu Comics published several comics adapting the &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; storyline. Among the first released titles were &lt;em&gt;The Spartans&lt;/em&gt;, created with the help of author Bill Spangler and illustrator James Tucker, and &lt;em&gt;A Breed Apart&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Steve Jones. Other titles included &lt;em&gt;Public Enemy&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Sandy Carruthers and illustrated by Lowell Cunningham, and a crossover series with the &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; franchise titled &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt; series included four different adventures called &lt;em&gt;Plans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pasts&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pawns&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pains&lt;/em&gt; along with a collector&amp;rsquo;s edition. Other contributors to the series included illustrators Terry Pallott and Leonard Kirk to titles like, &lt;em&gt;The Skin Trade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;remake&#34;&gt;Remake &lt;a href=&#34;#remake&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 25, 2015, Fox announced a remake with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing. On September 9, 2016, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported that Jeff Nichols would write and direct the film. On January 25, 2021, it was announced that Jeff Nichols would remake the film as a ten-part television series. On June 21, 2024, it was reported Nichols was developing an original sci-fi feature film for Paramount instead of an Alien Nation project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive overview of the 1982 American science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison. The film tells the story of a boy, Elliott, who befriends an extraterrestrial stranded on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A race of alien botanists visits Earth, but one of them gets separated from the group and is left behind. The alien takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Elliott lures the alien back to his home with Reese&amp;rsquo;s Pieces, and he hides the creature in his room. Elliott introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and five-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep E.T. hidden from their mother, Mary. Elliott and the creature begin to bond, they start to share thoughts and emotions. E.T. displays telekinetic abilities and revives a dead chrysanthemum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because E.T. is drinking beer and watching television at home. Inspired by a Buck Rogers comic strip, E.T. builds a makeshift device to &amp;ldquo;phone home&amp;rdquo;, using various parts around the Taylor home. On Halloween, the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks E.T. into the forest, where they set up the device to call E.T.&amp;rsquo;s people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the next day. He returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding him pale and weakened in a culvert. He takes E.T. home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveal the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott&amp;rsquo;s help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T&amp;rsquo;s arrival a genuine miracle. However, E.T. dies while Elliott rapidly recovers. Left alone to say goodbye, Elliott tells E.T. that he loves him, but E.T.&amp;rsquo;s heart begins to glow and he is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that his people are returning for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael&amp;rsquo;s friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.&amp;rsquo;s ship arrives, and he says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gifts him the chrysanthemum he previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but E.T. places his glowing finger on Elliott&amp;rsquo;s head and tells him that he will always be there. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as the ship blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;rsquo;s concept originated from an imaginary friend Steven Spielberg created after his parents&amp;rsquo; divorce. He initially planned a darker project called &lt;em&gt;Night Skies&lt;/em&gt; but developed a subplot into what became &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; Melissa Mathison wrote the first draft, titled &lt;em&gt;E.T. and Me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-production&#34;&gt;Pre-production &lt;a href=&#34;#pre-production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlo Rambaldi designed the animatronics for E.T., inspired by his painting &lt;em&gt;Women of Delta&lt;/em&gt; and the faces of Carl Sandburg, Albert Einstein, and Ernest Hemingway. Kathleen Kennedy visited the Jules Stein Eye Institute to study eyes for E.T. Four heads were created for filming, one as the main animatronic and the others for facial expressions, as well as a costume. Tamara De Treaux, Pat Bilon, and Matthew DeMeritt took turns wearing the costume. Mars, Incorporated refused to allow M&amp;amp;M&amp;rsquo;s to be used in the film, so The Hershey Company was asked if Reese&amp;rsquo;s Pieces could be used, and it agreed. Henry Feinberg created E.T.&amp;rsquo;s communicator device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;casting&#34;&gt;Casting &lt;a href=&#34;#casting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spielberg cast Henry Thomas as Elliott after an impressive improvised audition scene. Robert MacNaughton played Michael, and Drew Barrymore was cast as Gertie. Pat Welsh provided the major voice work for E.T., with additional sounds from Debra Winger, Spielberg, and various animals. A scene featuring Harrison Ford as the school principal was cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal photography began on September 8, 1981, in Los Angeles County and the San Fernando Valley, under the cover name &lt;em&gt;A Boy&amp;rsquo;s Life&lt;/em&gt;. Filming locations included Culver City High School, Northridge, Tujunga, Laird International Studios in Culver City, and a redwood forest near Crescent City in Northern California. The exterior Halloween scene and the &amp;ldquo;flying bicycle&amp;rdquo; chase scenes were filmed in Porter Ranch. The film was shot in roughly chronological order to achieve convincing emotional performances from the young cast. Sean Frye revealed how the visual effect close-up shots for the climax of the &amp;ldquo;flying bicycle&amp;rdquo; chase scene were filmed. BMX riders Robert Cardoza, Greg Maes, and David Lee served as stunt doubles for the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Williams composed the score, taking a modernist approach with polytonality and the Lydian mode. Spielberg edited the final chase sequence to suit Williams&amp;rsquo; music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film explores themes of divorce, alienation, growing up, and communication. Critics have noted parallels between E.T. and Elliott, as well as religious parallels between E.T. and Jesus. Some see the movie as a modern fairy tale, drawing comparisons to Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz. Kathleen Kennedy highlighted tolerance as an important theme.&lt;/p&gt;

It opened at number one at the US box office and stayed at the top for six weeks. In 1983, &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; surpassed &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to become the highest-grossing film of all time. The film was also a merchandising success, with dolls selling 15 million units by September 1982 and becoming the best-selling toy that Christmas season. The film was re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60 million and $68 million respectively. It was re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, to commemorate the film&amp;rsquo;s 40th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 27, 1988. The videos were priced with a recommended retail price of $24.95, the lowest initial price at the time for a major movie compared to the normal price of $89.95. The film doubled the record pre-orders of &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt; released the same month and went on to sell over 15 million VHS units in the United States, and grossed over $250 million in video sales revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film received near-universal acclaim. Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars, and Michael Sragow of &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; called Spielberg &amp;ldquo;a space age Jean Renoir.&amp;rdquo; George Will was one of few to pan the film. The film holds a 99% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accolades&#34;&gt;Accolades &lt;a href=&#34;#accolades&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was nominated for nine Oscars at the 55th Academy Awards, winning four: Best Original Score, Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It also won Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Original Score.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-autopsy-fact-or-fiction-1995-film&#34;&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction (1995 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy-fact-or-fiction-1995-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry discusses the 1995 pseudo-documentary &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which featured footage purporting to show an alien autopsy conducted after the Roswell incident. The footage, released by British entrepreneur Ray Santilli, was broadcast on television networks worldwide, including Fox television, hosted by Jonathan Frakes, and Channel 4 in the UK. Despite its popularity, the program was thoroughly debunked, with the footage revealed to have been shot on a set in London using plaster casts filled with offal and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the production of the hoaxed footage. In 2006, Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield admitted to creating the 1995 footage in a documentary presented by Eamonn Holmes. They simulated an autopsy on a fabricated alien, constructed by artist and sculptor John Humphreys in a London flat. Humphreys created two dummy alien bodies filled with raspberry jam, sheep brains, and chicken entrails. Alien artifacts were also fabricated. Santilli and Shoefield also admitted to hiring a homeless man in Los Angeles to play the role of the original cameraman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines how &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; was received and referenced in media. &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; satirized the footage, and Fox later aired a special debunking it. A fictionalized version of the creation of the footage was retold in the comedy film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;contact-1997-film&#34;&gt;Contact (1997 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#contact-1997-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a 1997 American science fiction drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 novel of the same name. The film stars Jodie Foster as Dr. Eleanor Arroway, a SETI scientist who discovers evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ellie Arroway, driven by the childhood loss of her father and inspired by his encouragement of her amateur radio hobby, dedicates her life to SETI research at the Arecibo Observatory. Facing funding cuts led by President&amp;rsquo;s science advisor David Drumlin, she secures private funding from the reclusive billionaire S.R. Hadden to continue her work at the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years later, Arroway discovers a signal from the star Vega containing a sequence of prime numbers. The discovery leads to a global effort to decode the message, which is complicated by Drumlin and the National Security Council&amp;rsquo;s attempts to control the facility. The signal is found to contain a video of Adolf Hitler&amp;rsquo;s opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics, the first Earth transmission strong enough to reach Vega.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroway&amp;rsquo;s team decodes the signal, revealing schematics for a complex machine designed to transport a single person. Multiple nations collaborate to fund the machine&amp;rsquo;s construction at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. An international panel is formed to select a candidate for the journey. Arroway is a leading contender, but her atheism, highlighted by panel member Palmer Joss, jeopardizes her selection. Drumlin is chosen, but a religious terrorist destroys the machine during testing, killing Drumlin and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadden, now terminally ill and living on the Mir space station, informs Arroway of a second, secretly constructed machine in Hokkaido, Japan. Arroway is selected to use it. Equipped with recording devices, she enters the pod and travels through wormholes, observing alien structures and a celestial event. She finds herself on a beach resembling a childhood drawing of Pensacola, Florida, and encounters an alien taking the form of her deceased father, who explains that the aliens have been monitoring humanity&amp;rsquo;s radio emissions and have deemed them ready for first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroway awakens in the pod, which has only fallen a short distance into a safety net. Mission control insists that the experiment achieved nothing, and her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee, led by Michael Kitz, investigates the possibility of a hoax orchestrated by Hadden, who has since died. Arroway asks the committee to accept her testimony on faith, emphasizing the profound impact of her experience. Kitz and Rachel Constantine, a White House official, acknowledge that Arroway&amp;rsquo;s device recorded 18 hours of static. Arroway receives continued funding for SETI research at the VLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film features a cast of notable actors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jodie Foster as Dr. Eleanor &amp;ldquo;Ellie&amp;rdquo; Ann Arroway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jena Malone as young Ellie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan conceived &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; in 1979 with Lynda Obst and Peter Guber at Casablanca FilmWorks. Sagan and Ann Druyan completed the film treatment in 1980, aiming to depict a realistic first contact scenario. Kip Thorne consulted on wormhole travel. The character of Ellie Arroway was not directly inspired by Jill Tarter, though Foster met her for research. The name Ellie was inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project faced numerous rewrites and stalled development. Sagan rewrote &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; as a novel, published in 1985. Roland Joffé and George Miller were initially attached to direct but later departed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Zemeckis took over as director, securing artistic control. Filming began in September 1996 and concluded in February 1997. Key locations included the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, Warner Hollywood Studios, and Culver Studios. CNN news personalities were scripted into the film to enhance realism. Second unit filming took place at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Fiji, Saint John, US Virgin Islands, and Newfoundland, Canada. Technical consultants from the SETI Institute, Caltech, and a former White House staff member were involved. Sagan participated in the production until his death in December 1996, and the film is dedicated to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-effects&#34;&gt;Visual effects &lt;a href=&#34;#visual-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight VFX companies, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Weta Digital, and Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic, collaborated on the visual effects. Weta Digital designed the wormhole sequence. Digital alterations were made to news footage of Bill Clinton. Digital color correction addressed continuity issues during location shooting. The opening scene is a five-minute CGI sequence depicting a zoom out from Earth to the distant universe. The mirror shot was created through three different plates and manipulated in CGI. The machine was designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a design he created as a &amp;ldquo;time-displacement device&amp;rdquo; for an unused scene in &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Silvestri composed and conducted the original score. A soundtrack album was released in August 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores the cultural conflicts between religion and science, particularly concerning the existence of God. The film presents various viewpoints on faith and scientific evidence. It depicts intense public debate about the implications of alien contact, including questions about morality and the role of science. The film raises questions about the authenticity of Arroway&amp;rsquo;s journey, leaving room for doubt. The film suggests that science and religion can coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s release in July 1997 boosted interest in Sagan&amp;rsquo;s novel. The book appeared on &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best Seller list. The film premiered on July 1, 1997, and was released in the United States and Canada on July 11, 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alienoid-2022-film&#34;&gt;Alienoid (2022 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alienoid-2022-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2022 South Korean science fiction action film directed by Choi Dong-hoon, starring Ryu Jun-yeol, Kim Woo-bin, and Kim Tae-ri. The film involves time travel between the Goryeo era and the present day, with the appearance of aliens. It was released in IMAX and 4DX formats. A sequel, &lt;em&gt;Alienoid: Return to the Future&lt;/em&gt;, was released in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot alternates between the modern day and the Goryeo era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prologue-1380-ad&#34;&gt;Prologue: 1380 A.D. &lt;a href=&#34;#prologue-1380-ad&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monk warriors fail to defeat an alien and its human host. Guard and Thunder, humanoid robots from the future, extract the alien. The dying host asks Guard to care for her baby, but Guard initially refuses due to non-interference policies. Thunder smuggles the infant back with them to the modern day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline-1-2012-2022-ad&#34;&gt;Timeline 1: 2012-2022 A.D. &lt;a href=&#34;#timeline-1-2012-2022-ad&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard raises the baby girl, Yi-an, without revealing his true identity. Yi-an becomes suspicious and discovers the truth about Guard, Thunder, and her origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yi-an finds her way to Jisan Hospital, the site of an incoming alien prisoner transport. Guard and Thunder explain alien imprisonment mechanics. A prisoner-aligned alien ship arrives, planning to awaken the Controller and release haava to transform Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, awakening all alien prisoners and poisoning humanity. The pilot awakens the Controller and releases haava, devastating the city and awakening other prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard, Thunder, and Yi-an kill the alien pilot and prevent further haava release. Badly wounded, Yi-an travels back in time with the aliens, intending to strand them in the past. Guard is destroyed, Thunder sinks in a river, and the Controller is forced to abandon its host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline-2-1391-ad&#34;&gt;Timeline 2: 1391 A.D. &lt;a href=&#34;#timeline-2-1391-ad&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years after Thunder crash-lands, a Taoist bounty hunter named Mureuk pursues the Divine Blade (Guard&amp;rsquo;s power source). Mureuk meets martial arts figures like the Monk Guru, the Dual Mages, and Dogturd. He also meets Yi-an (the &amp;ldquo;Girl Who Shoots Thunder&amp;rdquo;) and Suiter and Ja-jang, aliens from the future who have taken over a local cult. The Divine Blade and Thunder&amp;rsquo;s location are key to controlling the haava release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chaotic battle ensues. Yi-an lures one alien away, while the other is defeated. Yi-an approaches Thunder&amp;rsquo;s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monk Guru, the Dual Mages, and Dogturd were all near the initial alien crash and are potential hosts for the Controller. However, Mureuk, Monk Guru&amp;rsquo;s apprentice, rescued Yi-an and became the Controller&amp;rsquo;s new host, losing his memories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and large, black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoids with grey skin, elongated bodies, small chests, and a lack of muscular definition. They are said to lack external human body parts like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their most striking feature is their disproportionately large heads with no hair and large, opaque, black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection further elaborates on the physical appearance of Grey aliens. They are generally depicted as lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from humans. The most prominent feature is their large, black, almond-shaped eyes, often described as lacking eye whites. They are also frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains the origin of the connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system. The association began with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and determined that the aliens&amp;rsquo; home was Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype. It notes that descriptions of beings similar to Greys predate alien encounter claims, citing H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; descriptions of future humans in &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; (1893) and the Eloi in &amp;ldquo;The Time Machine&amp;rdquo; (1895).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the literary and occult origins of the Grey alien concept. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; depictions of future humans and the Eloi are mentioned as early examples of beings with Grey-like characteristics. Aleister Crowley&amp;rsquo;s 1917 encounter with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, described as similar to a modern Grey, is also discussed. Gustav Sandgren&amp;rsquo;s 1933 science fiction novel, &lt;em&gt;Den okända faran&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;), which describes a race of extraterrestrials with grey skin, bald heads, and large eyes, is identified as a key influence on the modern image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case and its role in popularizing the Grey alien archetype. The Hills claimed that in 1961, they were abducted by grayish-skinned humanoid beings and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s 1990 article suggests that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which featured an alien with large eyes. Carl Sagan echoed these suspicions, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses how Grey aliens became an integral part of ufology and extraterrestrial-related folklore after the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter. Journalist C.D.B. Bryan notes that 73% of reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. The section also mentions the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, and claims that individuals saw the U.S. military handling child-sized beings with oversized heads and slanted eyes. Whitley Strieber&amp;rsquo;s 1987 book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, which described his alleged encounters with Greys, is also discussed. Jimmy Guieu&amp;rsquo;s 1988 interview on TF1&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ciel, mon mardi!&lt;/em&gt; introduced the term &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; to the French public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section further notes that Greys have become the subject of many conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of a government disinformation campaign or a product of mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s 1995 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to depict the autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection analyzes the role of Greys in alien abduction claims. It notes that Greys make up a significant percentage of reported alien encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focus of abduction claims, with abductees reporting that the Greys stare into their eyes during mental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents neurologist Steven Novella&amp;rsquo;s theory that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with their distinctive features representing traits associated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses Frederick V. Malmstrom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis,&amp;rdquo; which suggests that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom argues that the face of a Grey can be reconstructed through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face based on early-childhood sensation and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s argument that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection briefly mentions alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of alleged Grey aliens, including the interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the depiction of Grey aliens in popular culture. It notes that Greys have become a common way to depict extraterrestrials in fiction, supplanting the &amp;ldquo;little green men&amp;rdquo; archetype. Examples include Ultraman (1966), &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;. The section also mentions the increasing association of Greys with conspiracy theories in the 1990s, citing &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; as a prominent example. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The films &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; (2011) and &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; (2013) are also mentioned, as well as the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; (2021) and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt; (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulians, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin, lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition, and having disproportionately short legs. A key feature is their large heads relative to their bodies, devoid of hair, with small orifices for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their eyes are large, opaque, black, and almond-shaped. They are often described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system stems from Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969.

&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of beings resembling Grey aliens predate reported encounters. H.G. Wells described future humans with similar features in his 1893 article &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; and his 1895 novel &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. In 1917, Aleister Crowley described an entity named Lam with a similar appearance. In 1933, Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, described aliens with grey clothes, bald heads, and large eyes in his science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 brought the Grey alien archetype to public attention in 1965. The Hills claimed they were abducted by grey-skinned humanoids and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which aired shortly before Barney&amp;rsquo;s first hypnotic session. Carl Sagan also suggested &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as a potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter, Greys became a central figure in ufology and extraterrestrial folklore, particularly in the United States, where they account for 73% of reported alien encounters. The alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, was later linked to Greys. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, a book detailing his alleged encounters with Greys, which became a bestseller and was adapted into a film. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu introduced the term &amp;ldquo;les Petits-Gris&amp;rdquo; (little greys) to French audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys have become the subject of conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of government disinformation campaigns or mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage of an autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from Roswell, but later admitted it was a &amp;ldquo;reconstruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys are frequently associated with alien abduction claims, accounting for a significant percentage of reported encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focal point, with claims of inducing hallucinogenic states or emotions through staring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurologist Steven Novella suggests that Grey aliens are a product of the human imagination, with their features representing traits associated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frederick V. Malmstrom proposes that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development, reconstructing the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologist Jack Cohen argues that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interdimensional, cryptoterrestrial, and time-traveler hypotheses offer alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of these alleged beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the presence of Grey aliens in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens have become a common depiction of extraterrestrials in fiction, replacing the earlier &amp;ldquo;little green men.&amp;rdquo; They have appeared in films and television shows such as &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;. During the 1990s, plotlines linking Greys to conspiracy theories became prevalent, as seen in &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The film &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; features a Grey alien who attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; presence in pop culture to government manipulation. The film &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; features child abduction by Greys. Greys also appear in the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-film&#34;&gt;Alien (film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; is a 1979 science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon. The film follows the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo as they encounter a deadly extraterrestrial creature. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial spaceship Nostromo is returning to Earth when its computer detects a transmission from a nearby planetoid. The crew investigates a derelict alien spaceship and discovers a chamber containing hundreds of eggs. One of the crew members, Kane, is attacked by a creature that attaches itself to his face. The creature eventually detaches itself, and Kane appears to be fine. However, during a meal, a small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him. The crew then tries to hunt down and kill the alien, which grows into a deadly creature. The crew members are killed off one by one, until only Ripley remains. She initiates the ship&amp;rsquo;s self-destruct sequence and escapes in a shuttle, but the alien stows away. Ripley manages to blast the alien into space before putting herself into stasis for the return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Skerritt&lt;/strong&gt; as Dallas, captain of the Nostromo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigourney Weaver&lt;/strong&gt; as Ripley, the warrant officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veronica Cartwright&lt;/strong&gt; as Lambert, the navigator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Dean Stanton&lt;/strong&gt; as Brett, the engineering technician.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Hurt&lt;/strong&gt; as Kane, the executive officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian Holm&lt;/strong&gt; as Ash, the science officer who is revealed to be an android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yaphet Kotto&lt;/strong&gt; as Parker, the chief engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolaji Badejo&lt;/strong&gt; as the alien.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helen Horton&lt;/strong&gt; as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo&amp;rsquo;s computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing &lt;a href=&#34;#writing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett collaborated on the screenplay, with O&amp;rsquo;Bannon initially writing 29 pages titled &lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt;. The story was influenced by various science fiction and horror works, including &lt;em&gt;The Thing from Another World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forbidden Planet&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Vampires&lt;/em&gt;. The script was pitched as &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Jaws&lt;/em&gt; in space&amp;rdquo;. Hill and Giler made revisions to the script, adding the android character Ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th Century-Fox greenlit &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; after the success of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Ridley Scott was chosen as the director. Scott created detailed storyboards, which led to the film&amp;rsquo;s budget being doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;casting&#34;&gt;Casting &lt;a href=&#34;#casting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casting calls were held in New York City and London. Scott wanted strong actors to focus on the film&amp;rsquo;s visual style. The crew of the Nostromo was intended to resemble working astronauts, described as &amp;ldquo;truckers in space&amp;rdquo;. Scott wrote backstories for each character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filming took place at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios near London, and model filming was done at Bray Studios. The production schedule was short due to the film&amp;rsquo;s low budget. Sets were constructed for the alien planetoid, the Nostromo, and the derelict spacecraft. The space suits were thick and bulky, causing discomfort for the actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-production&#34;&gt;Post-production &lt;a href=&#34;#post-production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing and post-production took roughly 20 weeks. The film was edited to have a slow pace to build suspense. One scene that was cut involved Ripley encountering Dallas and Brett, who had been partially cocooned by the alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Goldsmith composed the musical score. Scott initially wanted Isao Tomita, but Fox wanted a more familiar composer. Goldsmith&amp;rsquo;s score was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Grammy Award, and it won a BAFTA Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H. R. Giger designed the alien and its environment. The &amp;ldquo;facehugger&amp;rdquo; was the first creature Giger designed. The &amp;ldquo;chestburster&amp;rdquo; design was inspired by Francis Bacon&amp;rsquo;s painting &lt;em&gt;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-alien&#34;&gt;The alien &lt;a href=&#34;#the-alien&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giger made conceptual paintings of the adult alien before settling on the final version. Carlo Rambaldi manufactured the head. Bolaji Badejo portrayed the alien in most scenes. Scott chose not to show the full alien for most of the film to create a sense of terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sets&#34;&gt;Sets &lt;a href=&#34;#sets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sets of the Nostromo&amp;rsquo;s three decks were created in one piece. Ron Cobb created industrial-style symbols and color-coded signs. The company that owns the Nostromo is referred to as &amp;ldquo;Weylan-Yutani&amp;rdquo;. Art director Roger Christian used scrap metal and parts to create set pieces and props.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spaceships-and-planets&#34;&gt;Spaceships and planets &lt;a href=&#34;#spaceships-and-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Cobb and Chris Foss worked on designs for the spaceship and space suits. Cobb created sketches of the ship&amp;rsquo;s interiors and exteriors. The spaceships and planets were shot using models and miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;title-sequence&#34;&gt;Title sequence &lt;a href=&#34;#title-sequence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title sequence was developed by R/Greenberg Associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; was rated &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; in the United States and &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; in the United Kingdom. It opened in a limited release in American theaters on May 25, 1979, and received a wide release on June 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;box-office&#34;&gt;Box office &lt;a href=&#34;#box-office&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was a commercial success, grossing $78.9 million in the United States and £7,886,000 in the United Kingdom during its first run. Its total worldwide gross has been estimated at between $104.9 million and $203.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical reaction to &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; was initially mixed. However, in subsequent years, it was critically reassessed and is now considered one of the greatest science fiction and horror films of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, 20th Century Fox released a &amp;ldquo;Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut&amp;rdquo; of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, which included restored footage and recut scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics have analyzed &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s sexual overtones and its use of abjection. The film has been interpreted as a metaphor for male fear of penetration and as a representation of the &amp;ldquo;monstrous-feminine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;audience-research&#34;&gt;Audience research &lt;a href=&#34;#audience-research&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its 45th anniversary, &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; was re-released in theaters on April 26, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite initial mixed reviews, &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; has received critical acclaim over the years and is seen as one of the most influential science-fiction films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cultural-influences&#34;&gt;Cultural influences &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-influences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. The &amp;ldquo;chestburster&amp;rdquo; effect was parodied in Mel Brooks&amp;rsquo;s comedy &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;. Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; video game series was significantly influenced by &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;merchandise&#34;&gt;Merchandise &lt;a href=&#34;#merchandise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of the film. &lt;em&gt;Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt; magazine published a graphic novel adaptation. Model kits and action figures of the alien were released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;school-play-adaptation&#34;&gt;School play adaptation &lt;a href=&#34;#school-play-adaptation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, students at North Bergen High School adapted the film into a play, which gained social media recognition and praise from Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;video-game-adaptation&#34;&gt;Video game adaptation &lt;a href=&#34;#video-game-adaptation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two downloadable content packs for the video game &lt;em&gt;Alien: Isolation&lt;/em&gt; depict alternate versions of key events from the film, with the original cast members reprising their roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sequels-and-franchise&#34;&gt;Sequels and franchise &lt;a href=&#34;#sequels-and-franchise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; led to three direct sequels: &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; (1986), &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt; (1992), and &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt; (1997). The story of Ripley&amp;rsquo;s encounters with the aliens became the thematic and narrative core of the series. The film series resulted in a media franchise with novels, comic books, video games, and merchandise. A prequel series was started with &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt; (2012) and continued with &lt;em&gt;Alien: Covenant&lt;/em&gt; (2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2004 science fiction action horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, &lt;em&gt;Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt; brings together the titular creatures from the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt; franchises. The story draws inspiration from a 1989 comic book and incorporates elements of Aztec mythology and the writings of Erich von Däniken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Antarctica, a Predator ship melts a hole in the ice, revealing a buried pyramid. Charles Weyland assembles a team to investigate. The team discovers evidence of an ancient civilization and a sacrificial chamber. Three Predators arrive and descend into the pyramid, where they encounter the humans and awakened Xenomorphs. Battles ensue, and Lex Woods and Sebastian De Rosa learn about the Predators&amp;rsquo; history on Earth through hieroglyphs. They discover that the Predators have been visiting Earth for millennia, teaching humans to build pyramids and using them for rite of passage rituals involving Xenomorphs. Lex and Sebastian ally with a Predator named Scar to prevent the Xenomorphs from escaping. Scar destroys the pyramid, but the Xenomorph Queen attacks. Lex and Scar defeat the Queen, and an elder Predator gifts Lex a spear. A Predalien chestburster erupts from Scar&amp;rsquo;s body on the Predator spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Cameron had been working on a fifth &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; film, and Ridley Scott had a concept to explore the origins of the alien creatures. However, upon learning of &lt;em&gt;Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt;, Cameron ceased work, believing it would damage the franchise. Ridley Scott also expressed disinterest in the &lt;em&gt;Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt; films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept originated from the &lt;em&gt;Aliens versus Predator&lt;/em&gt; comic book. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created a spec screenplay in 1990–1991. The project was delayed due to &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt;. Paul W. S. Anderson pitched John Davis a story adapting the Machiko Noguchi series. Anderson began working on the film after completing the script for &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt;, with Shane Salerno co-writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;story-and-setting&#34;&gt;Story and setting &lt;a href=&#34;#story-and-setting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenced by Erich von Däniken and Aztec mythology, Anderson depicted Predators teaching humans to build pyramids and being treated as gods. The Predators would use Earth for rite of passage rituals every 100 years, hunting Aliens. If overwhelmed, the Predators would use self-destruct weapons. H. P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;At the Mountains of Madness&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Aliens vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt; comic series influenced the story. The film is set on Bouvet Island in Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lance Henriksen was the first actor cast, maintaining continuity with the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; series. He plays Charles Bishop Weyland, tying into the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Sanaa Lathan was cast as Alexa Woods. Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered for a cameo as Major Alan &amp;ldquo;Dutch&amp;rdquo; Schaeffer from &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt;. Sigourney Weaver declined to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production began in 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague. Richard Bridgland designed sets, props, and vehicles. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed, including interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid&amp;rsquo;s designs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilizations. Miniatures were used to enhance realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amalgamated Dynamics, Inc. (ADI) designed costumes, miniatures, and effects. The Predators&amp;rsquo; wrist blades were extended, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created. Each Predator was given a unique mask. A hydraulic Alien puppet was created for faster movements. CGI use was minimized. The Alien queen was filmed using practical, puppet, and computer-generated versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt; was released on VHS, DVD, and PSP UMD Movies. The DVD included audio commentaries, a &amp;ldquo;Making of&amp;rdquo; featurette, and deleted scenes. An &amp;ldquo;Extreme Edition&amp;rdquo; and an &amp;ldquo;Unrated Edition&amp;rdquo; were also released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film received generally negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported 21% positive reviews, with the consensus being &amp;ldquo;Gore without scares and cardboard cut-out characters make this clash of the monsters a dull sit.&amp;rdquo; Metacritic gave the film a score of 29 out of 100, indicating &amp;ldquo;generally unfavorable&amp;rdquo; reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34;&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1977 American science fiction drama film directed and written by Steven Spielberg. It tells the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue-collar worker in Indiana, and Jillian, a single mother, whose lives are changed after encounters with unidentified flying objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977, French scientist Claude Lacombe and his team examine Flight 19, found abandoned in the Sonoran Desert, and the SS Cotopaxi, found in the Gobi Desert. Near Indianapolis, Roy Neary has a close encounter with a UFO, becoming obsessed with a mountain shape. Jillian Guiler&amp;rsquo;s son, Barry, is abducted by a UFO. Lacombe&amp;rsquo;s team investigates increasing UFO activity, discovering a five-tone musical phrase. The coordinates point to Devils Tower in Wyoming. Roy and Jillian, along with others experiencing visions, head to Devils Tower, which is being evacuated by the US Army. They reach the site as UFOs appear. Scientists communicate with the UFOs using light and sound. A mothership arrives, releasing humans and animals, including Barry. Roy is chosen to join the extraterrestrials, entering the mothership as it departs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Dreyfuss stars as Roy Neary, an electrical lineman. François Truffaut plays Claude Lacombe, a French scientist. Teri Garr is Ronnie Neary, Roy&amp;rsquo;s wife, and Melinda Dillon portrays Jillian Guiler. Cary Guffey plays Barry Guiler, Jillian&amp;rsquo;s son. Bob Balaban appears as David Laughlin, Lacombe&amp;rsquo;s assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;rsquo;s inspiration came from Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s childhood experience watching a meteor shower. He developed a deal with Columbia Pictures in 1973. J. Allen Hynek, a UFO consultant, was hired. NASA declined to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal photography began in May 1976. Filming locations included Burbank, California; Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming; airship hangars in Mobile, Alabama; and a railroad depot in Bay Minette, Alabama. The Sonora Desert sequence was filmed at the Dumont Dunes, California, and the Dharmsala-India exteriors were filmed near Mumbai, India. Technical and budgetary problems arose during filming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-effects&#34;&gt;Visual effects &lt;a href=&#34;#visual-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, and Carlo Rambaldi designed the extraterrestrials. The mothership was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-production&#34;&gt;Post-production &lt;a href=&#34;#post-production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kahn was the film editor. Pick-ups were commissioned, with John A. Alonzo, László Kovács, and Douglas Slocombe working on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Williams composed the film score, including the iconic five-tone motif. Spielberg called Williams&amp;rsquo;s work &amp;ldquo;When You Wish Upon a Star meets science fiction.&amp;rdquo; Phillip Dodds from ARP Instruments installed the synthesizer on set and was cast as Jean Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film explores themes of humanity&amp;rsquo;s readiness to join the cosmos, the impact of new technologies, and spiritual yearning. Judeo-Christian analogies are present, with Devils Tower paralleling Mount Sinai. Communication and tolerance are also highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-and-reception&#34;&gt;Release and reception &lt;a href=&#34;#release-and-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;box-office&#34;&gt;Box office &lt;a href=&#34;#box-office&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film premiered in New York City on November 16, 1977, and was released nationally in December. It became a box office success, grossing over $300 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;critical-reception&#34;&gt;Critical reception &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews were mostly positive, with praise for Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s vision and the film&amp;rsquo;s climax. Some critics noted a lack of warmth compared to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reissues-and-home-media&#34;&gt;Reissues and home media &lt;a href=&#34;#reissues-and-home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several versions of the film have been released, including the original theatrical version, the Special Edition (1980), and the Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut (1998). The Special Edition added scenes, including the interior of the mothership, while the Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut removed the mothership interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accolades&#34;&gt;Accolades &lt;a href=&#34;#accolades&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film received numerous awards and nominations, including Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and Golden Globe Awards. It was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close Encounters&lt;/em&gt; is credited with launching the reemergence of science fiction films in the 1980s. Spielberg donated to the Planetary Society for extraterrestrial research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;interdimensional-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Interdimensional UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#interdimensional-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interdimensional UFO hypothesis (IUH) proposes that unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings result from encounters with other &amp;ldquo;dimensions&amp;rdquo; existing alongside our own. Ufologists such as Meade Layne, John Keel, J. Allen Hynek, and Jacques Vallée have advanced this hypothesis. Proponents suggest that UFOs are a modern manifestation of phenomena throughout human history, previously attributed to mythological or supernatural beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts similar to &amp;ldquo;other dimensions&amp;rdquo; exist in various religious and mystical traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-modern-history&#34;&gt;Pre-modern history &lt;a href=&#34;#pre-modern-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic mysticism, specifically Sufism, includes the concept of &lt;em&gt;al-ghayb&lt;/em&gt;, referring to the hidden and unseen. Within this tradition, &lt;em&gt;‘ālam al-mithāl&lt;/em&gt;, or &amp;ldquo;the world of similitude,&amp;rdquo; is an intermediary realm between the physical and spiritual worlds, inhabited by intelligent non-human entities like jinn and angels. Helena Blavatsky, founder of Theosophy, also contributed to the concept of other dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theorists&#34;&gt;Theorists &lt;a href=&#34;#theorists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, spiritualists believed in &amp;ldquo;other dimensions.&amp;rdquo; H.P. Blavatsky popularized the term &amp;ldquo;planes,&amp;rdquo; proposing a cosmology of seven planes. The term &amp;ldquo;ether&amp;rdquo; was adopted from ancient Greek via Victorian physics and incorporated into occult writings. Charles Webster Leadbeater and Annie Besant introduced the &amp;ldquo;etheric plane&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;etheric body&amp;rdquo; in Theosophy. The first use of the word, as &lt;em&gt;inter-dimensional&lt;/em&gt;, is in a novel by Z Gale of 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34;&gt;Meade Layne and &amp;lsquo;Ether Ships&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 4, 1947, occultist Meade Layne claimed that flying discs were &amp;ldquo;etheric.&amp;rdquo; Layne, claiming telepathic communication with &amp;ldquo;people in the saucers,&amp;rdquo; argued that objects could materialize from an etheric state. He believed these visitors were human beings from another world with good intentions. Layne is regarded as the earliest proponent of the interdimensional hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34;&gt;John Keel and &amp;lsquo;Ultraterrestrials&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Keel coined the term &amp;ldquo;ultraterrestrials&amp;rdquo; to describe UFO occupants as non-human entities existing in undetectable energy wavelengths. In his 1970 book &lt;em&gt;UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse&lt;/em&gt;, Keel argued that a non-human intelligence has staged events to propagate erroneous belief systems, including monsters, ghosts, demons, fairies, vampires, mystery airships, mystery aeroplanes, mystery helicopters, anomalous creature sightings, poltergeist phenomena, balls of light, and UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hynek-and-vallée&#34;&gt;Hynek and Vallée &lt;a href=&#34;#hynek-and-vall%c3%a9e&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and scientific advisor to the U.S. Air Force UFO studies (Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book), pioneered the &amp;ldquo;Close Encounter&amp;rdquo; classification system. Jacques Vallée, a student of Hynek&amp;rsquo;s, served as the inspiration for the French researcher portrayed by François Truffaut in the film &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;. In their 1975 book &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Reality&lt;/em&gt;, Vallée and Hynek considered the possibility of &amp;ldquo;interlocking universes.&amp;rdquo; Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1969 book &lt;em&gt;Passport to Magonia&lt;/em&gt; argues for a &amp;ldquo;parallel universe co-existing with our own.&amp;rdquo; Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1990 paper &amp;ldquo;Five Arguments Against the Extraterrestrial Origin of Unidentified Flying Objects&amp;rdquo; summarizes his objections to the extraterrestrial hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 film &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&lt;/em&gt; utilizes the interdimensional hypothesis, describing ancient aliens traveling into &amp;ldquo;the space between the spaces.&amp;rdquo; The 2014 movie &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; employs a mix of the interdimensional and time-traveler hypotheses, with future humans evolving to exist in five dimensions and building a tesseract inside a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-contrasting-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Other contrasting hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#other-contrasting-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IUH contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis (UFOs are from outside Earth) and the psychosocial hypothesis (UFOs are psychological or social phenomena). Other contrasting hypotheses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptoterrestrial hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space animal hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-traveler hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;

This idea is supported by ufologists who suggest that UFOs are a modern manifestation of phenomena throughout human history, previously attributed to mythological or supernatural beings.&lt;/p&gt;

Charles Webster Leadbeater and Annie Besant introduced the &amp;ldquo;etheric plane&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;etheric body&amp;rdquo; in Theosophy. The first use of the word, as &lt;em&gt;inter-dimensional&lt;/em&gt;, is in a novel by Z Gale of 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34;&gt;Meade Layne and &amp;lsquo;Ether Ships&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meade Layne, an occultist, claimed in 1947 that flying discs were &amp;ldquo;etheric.&amp;rdquo; Layne claimed telepathic communication with &amp;ldquo;people in the saucers,&amp;rdquo; arguing that objects could pass from an etheric to a dense level of matter. He stated that these visitors were human beings living in their own world with good intentions. Layne is regarded as the earliest proponent of the interdimensional hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34;&gt;John Keel and &amp;lsquo;Ultraterrestrials&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Keel coined the term &amp;ldquo;ultraterrestrials&amp;rdquo; to describe UFO occupants as non-human entities existing in a wavelength of energy undetectable to us. In his book &lt;em&gt;UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse&lt;/em&gt;, Keel argued that a non-human intelligence has staged events to propagate erroneous belief systems, including monsters, ghosts, demons, fairies, vampires, mystery airships, anomalous creatures, poltergeists, and UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hynek-and-vallée&#34;&gt;Hynek and Vallée &lt;a href=&#34;#hynek-and-vall%c3%a9e&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and scientific advisor to the U.S. Air Force UFO studies, pioneered the &amp;ldquo;Close Encounter&amp;rdquo; classification system. Jacques Vallée, a student of Hynek, served as the inspiration for a character in the film &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Reality&lt;/em&gt;, Vallée and Hynek considered the possibility of &amp;ldquo;interlocking universes.&amp;rdquo; Vallée argued for a &amp;ldquo;parallel universe co-existing with our own&amp;rdquo; in his book &lt;em&gt;Passport to Magonia&lt;/em&gt;. Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1990 paper &amp;ldquo;Five Arguments Against the Extraterrestrial Origin of Unidentified Flying Objects&amp;rdquo; summarized his objections to the extraterrestrial hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the presence of the interdimensional UFO hypothesis in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 film &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&lt;/em&gt; utilizes the interdimensional hypothesis, describing ancient aliens traveling into &amp;ldquo;the space between the spaces.&amp;rdquo; The 2014 movie &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; employs a mix of the interdimensional and time-traveler hypotheses, with future humans evolving to exist in five dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-contrasting-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Other contrasting hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#other-contrasting-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section contrasts the IUH with other hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IUH contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis, which suggests UFO sightings are caused by visitations from outside Earth, and the psychosocial hypothesis, which argues UFO sightings are best explained as psychological or social phenomena. Other contrasting hypotheses include the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, space animal hypothesis, and time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uncontacted peoples</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_87f3a49b74f0/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_87f3a49b74f0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;uncontacted-peoples&#34;&gt;Uncontacted Peoples &lt;a href=&#34;#uncontacted-peoples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncontacted peoples are Indigenous groups who live without sustained contact with neighboring communities and the world community. They choose to remain isolated, and are referred to as indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. Estimates suggest there are between 100 and 200 uncontacted tribes, totaling up to 10,000 individuals, primarily located in South America, especially northern Brazil. Knowledge about these groups is mainly gathered from neighboring Indigenous communities and aerial footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition&#34;&gt;Definition &lt;a href=&#34;#definition&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;uncontacted peoples&amp;rdquo; refers to Indigenous groups who have remained largely isolated, maintaining their traditional lifestyles independently from political or governmental entities. While most Indigenous groups have had some form of contact due to European exploration and colonization, &amp;ldquo;uncontacted&amp;rdquo; signifies a lack of sustained contact with the majority of non-Indigenous society today. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights calls them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; defined by their rejection of contact with outsiders, including those who previously had contact but chose to return to isolation. These groups are viewed as contemporaries of modernity, not relics of the past. A 2009 United Nations report also includes &amp;ldquo;peoples in initial contact&amp;rdquo; who are beginning to integrate into mainstream society. International organizations emphasize their agency by calling them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in isolation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; also known as &amp;ldquo;hidden peoples&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uncontacted tribes.&amp;rdquo; Historically, European colonial ideas about uncontacted peoples were influenced by the search for Prester John and the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying them as &amp;ldquo;lost tribes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relations-with-outsiders&#34;&gt;Relations with Outsiders &lt;a href=&#34;#relations-with-outsiders&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International organizations emphasize protecting indigenous peoples&amp;rsquo; lands and environment, preventing exploitation and abuse, and avoiding contact to prevent the spread of modern diseases. Historic exploitation has led governments to grant legal protection and land rights to uncontacted peoples, such as in the Vale do Javari in Brazil and North Sentinel Island in India. In 1961, British explorer Richard Mason was killed by the Panará tribe. Contact in 1973, when the BR-163 road was built through their territory, led to disease and environmental degradation, killing over 250 of the 350 Panará members within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contention often arises from governments&amp;rsquo; desire to extract natural resources. In Brazil, the government attempted assimilation in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was created, securing protected lands. In Colombia, contact with the Nukak tribe by an evangelical group led to respiratory infections, clashes with drug traffickers, and the death of over half the tribe, resulting in government relocation and poverty. Exploitation for lumbering, ranching, oil prospecting, and poaching poses significant dangers. Former Peruvian President Alan García claimed uncontacted groups were a &amp;ldquo;fabrication of environmentalists.&amp;rdquo; In 2016, a Chinese mining subsidiary in Bolivia ignored signs of encroaching on uncontacted tribes. Missionaries can also cause great damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Acre Indians contacted the Brazilian government due to threats from cocaine traffickers, indicating awareness of the outside world and strategic decisions to avoid contact. Satellite images show tribes migrating away from roads and logging. Indigenous rights activists advocate for leaving isolated peoples alone to protect their self-determination. FUNAI collaborates with experts to make controlled initial contact, operating trading posts for metal tools and cooking instruments, preventing conflicts, and delivering vaccinations. However, FUNAI reported receiving only 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, FUNAI released videos and images of tribes to raise public awareness and protect them from commercial pressures, investigating a possible mass homicide against the Flecheiros tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Human Rights Council (2009) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (2013) introduced guidelines including the right to choose self-isolation. Reports of &amp;ldquo;human safaris&amp;rdquo; in India&amp;rsquo;s Andaman Islands and the Peruvian Amazon, where tourists seek to view uncontacted peoples, are controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;by-region&#34;&gt;By Region &lt;a href=&#34;#by-region&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sentinelese&#34;&gt;Sentinelese &lt;a href=&#34;#sentinelese&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sentinelese people of North Sentinel Island reject contact, often with lethal force. Their language differs significantly from other Andaman languages, suggesting millennia of isolation. Experts consider them the most isolated people in the world. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997. In 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary, was killed while illegally visiting the island. In 2025, a US citizen was arrested for making an unauthorized landing on the island. Survival International condemned these actions, noting the vulnerability of uncontacted peoples to contact-induced diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shompen&#34;&gt;Shompen &lt;a href=&#34;#shompen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shompen are the Indigenous people of Great Nicobar Island, with an estimated population of 300 in 2001. They practice a hunter-gatherer economy. Survival International identifies them as one of the most isolated peoples, with most refusing interactions with outsiders. The proposed Great Nicobar Development Plan, including an airport, international port, and industrial park, threatens their way of life. In February 2024, 39 genocide experts warned that the development would be a &amp;ldquo;death sentence&amp;rdquo; for the Shompen due to increased population and exposure to outside diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;south-america&#34;&gt;South America &lt;a href=&#34;#south-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bolivia&#34;&gt;Bolivia &lt;a href=&#34;#bolivia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toromona are an uncontacted people living near the Madidi and Heath Rivers. The government has created a protected area within Madidi National Park for them. Among the Ayoreo people of the Gran Chaco, a small number of uncontacted nomadic hunter-gatherers reside in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park. Pacahuaras are believed to be living in voluntary isolation in Pando Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brazil&#34;&gt;Brazil &lt;a href=&#34;#brazil&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the 1970s, Brazil attempted to move people on commercially cultivatable lands. In 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was established, and the Vale do Javari was declared perpetually sealed off. In 2007, FUNAI reported 67 uncontacted Indigenous peoples, up from 40 in 2005. The Awá people live in the eastern Amazon rainforest, with approximately 350 members, 100 of whom are uncontacted. Their tribe is at risk due to conflicts with logging interests. The Kawahiva live in northern Mato Grosso, constantly moving and known primarily from physical evidence. In 2013, the government released video of the Kawahiva filmed in 2011. In 2025, FUNAI confirmed that the demarcation of the Kawahiva do Rio Pardo territory will happen by the end of 2025. The Korubu live in the lower Vale do Javari. The Flecheiros (&amp;ldquo;arrow people&amp;rdquo;) also live in the Vale do Javari. Other tribes may include the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and the Himarimã.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, two brothers of the Piripkura tribe initiated contact with FUNAI after their fire went out, becoming the focus of the documentary &lt;em&gt;Piripkura&lt;/em&gt;. Another man, the &amp;ldquo;Man of the Hole,&amp;rdquo; lived alone on 8,000 hectares, digging hundreds of holes. He was found dead in his dwelling in August 2022. Since 2021, uncontacted peoples in Brazil have been threatened by illegal land grabbers, loggers, and gold miners. The government of Jair Bolsonaro signaled its intention to develop the Amazon and reduce Indigenous reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;colombia&#34;&gt;Colombia &lt;a href=&#34;#colombia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is regarded as offering maximum protection to uncontacted Indigenous people through tribal reserves and strict patrolling. The Nukak people are nomadic hunter-gatherers living between the Guaviare and Inírida rivers. Groups, including the Carabayo, Yuri, and Passé, reside in Río Puré National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ecuador&#34;&gt;Ecuador &lt;a href=&#34;#ecuador&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two isolated Indigenous peoples of Ecuador live in the Amazon region: the Tagaeri and the Taromenane, both eastern Huaorani peoples living in Yasuni National Park. These semi-nomadic people live in small groups, subsisting on hunting, gathering, and some crops. Since 2007, national policy mandates untouchability, self-determination, equality, and no contact. In 2013, more than 20 Taromenane were killed by Waorani, another Huaorani group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paraguay&#34;&gt;Paraguay &lt;a href=&#34;#paraguay&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 100 Ayoreo people, some of whom are in the Totobiegosode tribe, live uncontacted in the forest. They are nomadic hunter-gatherers in Amotocodie. They are the last uncontacted peoples south of the Amazon Basin, threatened by illegal deforestation. Brazilian company Yaguarete Porá S.A. is converting their ancestral territory into cattle ranching land. The Union of Ayoreo Natives of Paraguay is working for their protection, with support from the Iniciativa Amotocodie. In 2021, the Ayoreo appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to save their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;peru&#34;&gt;Peru &lt;a href=&#34;#peru&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nomole (Mashco-Piro) are nomadic Arawak-speaking hunter-gatherers who inhabit Manú National Park. In 1998, their number was estimated at 100 to 250. They speak a dialect of the Piro languages. Amid incursions on their land, the tribe has made it clear they do not wish to be contacted. In July 2024, video and images of dozens of uncontact&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; franchise is a science fiction horror and action media franchise that began with the 1979 film &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. The series centers on Ellen Ripley&amp;rsquo;s battles with the extraterrestrial Xenomorph and the prequel series following the android David 8 and the Engineers. The franchise is owned by 20th Century Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Created by:&lt;/strong&gt; Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett
&lt;strong&gt;Original Work:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; (1979)
&lt;strong&gt;Owner:&lt;/strong&gt; 20th Century Studios
&lt;strong&gt;Years Active:&lt;/strong&gt; 1979–present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise &lt;a href=&#34;#premise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise depicts deadly encounters between humanity and the Xenomorph, a hostile extraterrestrial species. Humanity is a space-faring species, and space journeys require cryosleep. The megacorporation Weyland-Yutani Corp seeks to profit from the Aliens, manipulating and endangering characters. The series also explores the origin of the human race, with the Engineers sacrificing themselves to spark the genesis of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett collaborated on the script for &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. Brandywine Productions bought the script, and 20th Century Fox invested millions after the success of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. The Ripley character was initially to be played by Tom Skerritt, but Sigourney Weaver was cast instead. Ridley Scott directed the film. H. R. Giger designed the alien creature and derelict ship, Mœbius created the spacesuits, and Ron Cobb provided the industrial design for the sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Cameron expressed interest in continuing the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; story in 1983. After Cameron&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Terminator&lt;/em&gt; became a hit, he and Gale Anne Hurd were approved to direct and produce &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. Following the second film, Weaver was not interested in returning, but she was offered a $5 million salary and a producer credit to make &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt; faced script difficulties, trouble securing a director, and studio interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production on &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt; began in 1996. Weaver joined the project after being offered an $11 million salary and more creative control. The script resurrected the Ripley character via human cloning. Joss Whedon later said that he thought it had done &amp;ldquo;everything wrong&amp;rdquo; with his script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pentagon-ufo-videos&#34;&gt;Pentagon UFO Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#pentagon-ufo-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the widely publicized cockpit instrumentation display videos from US Navy fighter jets, often characterized as UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the videos, referencing historical UFO photographs and events. It details the initial incident on November 14, 2004, involving Commander David Fravor of the USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; Carrier Strike Group investigating radar indications of a possible target off the coast of southern California. The USS &lt;em&gt;Princeton&lt;/em&gt; had been tracking unusual aircraft for two weeks prior to the incident. Fravor&amp;rsquo;s account of encountering a white, oval object hovering above an ocean disturbance is highlighted, as well as the observations of other pilots. It also mentions Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, who recorded the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; video and coined the term &amp;ldquo;Tic Tac&amp;rdquo; to describe the object. The section also mentions the 2014-2015 incidents involving fighter pilots associated with the USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; carrier strike group operating off the East Coast of the United States, during which the GIMBAL and GOFAST videos were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-videos&#34;&gt;Release of Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the public release of the videos. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on the incidents and published the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL&amp;rdquo; videos in December 2017, while the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published the &amp;ldquo;GOFAST&amp;rdquo; video. Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, provided the videos to the press. Luis Elizondo, the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy. In September 2019, the Pentagon confirmed the videos were made by naval aviators. On April 27, 2020, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. In February 2020, the United States Navy confirmed that intelligence briefings have been provided to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021-release&#34;&gt;2021 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2021-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the release of additional footage in 2021. In April 2021, the Pentagon confirmed the authenticity of a video taken by Navy personnel aboard USS &lt;em&gt;Russell&lt;/em&gt; in 2019, showing a triangular object. Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acorn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metallic blimp&amp;rdquo;. In May 2021, a second video recorded by Navy personnel aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Omaha&lt;/em&gt; on July 15, 2019, was confirmed and is under review by the UAP Task Force. The video purportedly shows a spherical object flying over the ocean. Mick West commented on the video, suggesting it could simply be a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2023-release&#34;&gt;2023 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2023-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the release of additional videos in 2023. In early 2023, an object was filmed by two MQ-9 drones in South Asia, initially believed to be anomalous but later identified as a commuter aircraft. On May 31, 2023, Sean M. Kirkpatrick shared an infrared video recorded in the western United States in 2021, which AARO concluded to be commercial aircraft. On April 19, 2023, the Pentagon released another video featuring MQ-9 drone footage from the Middle East depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon resembling a small &amp;ldquo;metallic orb&amp;rdquo;. Sean M. Kirkpatrick briefed a Senate Armed Services subcommittee on the video, but stated they are unable to fully identify anything from the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-explanations&#34;&gt;Potential Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the aerial phenomena recorded in the videos. As of 2020, the Department of Defense characterizes the phenomena as &amp;ldquo;unidentified&amp;rdquo;. Skeptical explanations include instrument malfunction, human observational error, or common aircraft. Mick West cautioned that believers in &amp;ldquo;alien disclosure&amp;rdquo; are &amp;ldquo;encroaching on these real issues of UAPs&amp;rdquo;. Adam Frank speculated that the UFOs could be drones deployed by rivals like Russia and China. Thomas Bania speculated that they could be some form of electronic warfare fielded by China or Russia. The US Navy updated its reporting guidelines for unexplained aerial observations. Senator Marco Rubio expressed concern that the UFOs may be Chinese or Russian technology. Admiral Gary Roughead said that most assessments were inconclusive. Jeff Wise suggests advancements in electronic warfare could deceive sensors. In 2023, David Fravor testified under oath regarding the USS Nimitz sighting, stating that the technology was far superior to anything the US had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2021-ufo-report&#34;&gt;June 2021 UFO Report &lt;a href=&#34;#june-2021-ufo-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the preliminary report on UAPs released by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on June 25, 2021. The report came to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, citing a lack of sufficient data. Some UAPs appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics, including high velocity and maneuverability. The report indicated that the UAP recordings probably were of physical objects and proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; category. The report raised concerns about safety and security issues and indicated that investigation of the topic would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34;&gt;FOI Request by The Black Vault &lt;a href=&#34;#foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details a Freedom of Information request made by The Black Vault for the release of more video footage. The government confirmed it had more footage but refused to release it, citing concerns for national security. Gregory Cason stated that the release of this information would harm national security.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article details the alleged alien abduction of Barney and Betty Hill in 1961, a case that gained significant notoriety and influenced the alien abduction narrative. The article covers the background of the Hills, the details of their reported encounter, the aftermath, analysis of the star map Betty Hill claimed to have seen, and the cultural impact of their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney and Betty Hill were an interracial couple living in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Barney was a postal worker and Betty was a social worker. They were active in civil rights and community affairs. The article also mentions that they are the grandparents of UFC fighter Angela Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-encounter&#34;&gt;UFO Encounter &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-encounter&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 19-20, 1961, the Hills claimed to have encountered a UFO while driving back from a vacation in Canada. Near Lancaster, New Hampshire, Betty noticed a bright light in the sky. They stopped near Twin Mountain to observe the object, which Betty viewed through binoculars. Barney initially thought it was a commercial airliner, but it rapidly descended towards them. They continued driving, observing the object near Cannon Mountain and the Old Man of the Mountain. South of Indian Head, the object descended rapidly, causing Barney to stop the car. He observed humanoid figures through binoculars. Fearing capture, Barney ran back to the car, and as they drove away, they heard beeping sounds and experienced a daze. They reported the incident to NICAP investigator Walter Webb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;immediate-aftermath&#34;&gt;Immediate Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#immediate-aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home, the Hills noted odd sensations and unexplained occurrences. Betty insisted on keeping their luggage near the back door. Their watches stopped working. Barney found the binocular strap torn and his shoes scraped. They both took showers to remove possible contamination and drew pictures of what they had seen. Betty&amp;rsquo;s dress was torn and had a pinkish powder on it. Shiny, concentric circles appeared on their car&amp;rsquo;s trunk, which affected a compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34;&gt;Initial Report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member, interviewed the Hills. Barney mentioned a &amp;ldquo;mental block&amp;rdquo; and suspected he was suppressing parts of the event. Webb concluded that they were truthful, and the incident likely occurred as reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bettys-dreams&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Dreams &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-dreams&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after the encounter, Betty began experiencing vivid dreams for five consecutive nights. In her dreams, they encountered a roadblock and were forced into a forest by small men in blue uniforms. The men appeared nearly human with greyish skin. They were eventually returned to their car and watched the craft depart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34;&gt;Medical Help and More Interviews &lt;a href=&#34;#medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills sought medical help to understand their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;missing-time&#34;&gt;Missing Time &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-time&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a follow-up interview with NICAP members C.D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann, the Hills realized they had &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; – a period of about seven hours they couldn&amp;rsquo;t account for. They recalled almost nothing of a 35-mile stretch of road and an image of a fiery orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;private-disclosure&#34;&gt;Private Disclosure &lt;a href=&#34;#private-disclosure&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the Hills privately disclosed their encounter to Captain Ben H. Swett of the United States Air Force, who was interested in the &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Hypnosis Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills underwent hypnosis with Dr. Benjamin Simon to recover their memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barneys-sessions&#34;&gt;Barney&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#barneys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under hypnosis, Barney recalled the binocular strap breaking as he ran from the UFO. He remembered being compelled to drive into the woods and seeing six men. He described the beings&amp;rsquo; terrifying eyes and their communication through &amp;ldquo;thought transference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bettys-sessions&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s account under hypnosis was similar to her dreams, with some differences. The technology on the craft was different, the short men differed significantly in physical appearance and the sequential order of the abduction differed. Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s memories in hypnotic regression were consistent with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simons-conclusions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Conclusions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-conclusions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon concluded that the case was a psychological aberration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34;&gt;Post-Hypnosis Publicity and Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s Death &lt;a href=&#34;#post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills initially kept a low profile. However, in 1965, a front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Boston Traveller&lt;/em&gt; revealed their story, leading to international attention. John G. Fuller wrote the book &lt;em&gt;The Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; about the case in 1966. Barney died in 1969, and Betty became a figure in the UFO community. Betty died in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-the-star-map&#34;&gt;Analyzing the Star Map &lt;a href=&#34;#analyzing-the-star-map&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Marjorie Fish, an amateur astronomer, attempted to decipher the star map Betty Hill had drawn. Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars and concluded that the map&amp;rsquo;s perspective matched the Zeta Reticuli star system. The analysis was debated, with Carl Sagan arguing it was a random alignment of points. Later, more accurate data from the Hipparcos mission led Fish to reject her hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interrupted-journey&#34;&gt;Interrupted Journey &lt;a href=&#34;#interrupted-journey&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; by John G. Fuller detailed the Hills&amp;rsquo; claims. Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s niece, Kathleen Marden, further explored these themes in &lt;em&gt;Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rebutting-the-hills&#34;&gt;Rebutting the Hills &lt;a href=&#34;#rebutting-the-hills&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Macdonald argued that the Hills&amp;rsquo; experience was caused by misinterpreting an aircraft warning beacon on Cannon Mountain, combined with stress, sleep deprivation, and false memories. Robert Sheaffer criticized Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s credibility, citing her UFO photos and later delusional stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34;&gt;Influence from &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt;. Jason Colavito pointed out other episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; that aired before Barney&amp;rsquo;s hypnosis sessions that were even more reminiscent of the Hill&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-media&#34;&gt;In Popular Media &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills&amp;rsquo; story has been depicted in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nonfictional-accounts&#34;&gt;Nonfictional Accounts &lt;a href=&#34;#nonfictional-accounts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney Hill appeared on &lt;em&gt;To Tell the Truth&lt;/em&gt; in 1966. Kathleen Marden and Stanton Friedman authored &lt;em&gt;Captured&lt;/em&gt; in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-fiction&#34;&gt;In Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1975 film &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; dramatized the Hills&amp;rsquo; abduction. The story has also been referenced in comic books, films like &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, virtual reality exhibits, and television series like &lt;em&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; which are names given in ufology to humanoid races purportedly from the Pleiades star cluster. These beings are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans, with features like tall stature (6-7 ft), blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention pale-blue/grey or pastel purple skin tones. George Adamski is noted as one of the first to report contact with these beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding them often includes telepathy, benevolence, and physical beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the historical context and cultural influences related to the Nordic alien phenomenon. David J. Skal suggests that the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; may have inspired early stories. Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; associating Nordic aliens with spiritual growth and protection. These aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned with Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal and youthful. While popular in the 1950s, claims of encounters became less common as the grey alien archetype rose to prominence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; a type of humanoid extraterrestrial beings often discussed in ufology. These beings are said to originate from the Pleiades star cluster and are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans. They are typically depicted as taller than average humans (6-7 ft), with blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention skin tones of pale blue/grey or pastel purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Adamski, a Polish-American ufologist, is noted as one of the first to publicly claim contact with Nordic beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding these beings often includes themes of telepathy, benevolence, beauty, and grace. Telepathy is often described as the primary form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context and cultural influences surrounding the Nordic alien narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural historian David J. Skal suggests that the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; may have inspired early stories of Nordic-type aliens. The film features an extraterrestrial arriving on Earth to warn humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bates College professor Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; noting that Nordic aliens are often associated with spiritual growth, love, and protection among believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of encounters with Nordic aliens were common in Europe during the 1950s but became less frequent in later decades, as the grey alien became more prevalent in extraterrestrial encounter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;correlation-between-ufo-reports-and-atomic-sites&#34;&gt;Correlation between UFO reports and atomic sites &lt;a href=&#34;#correlation-between-ufo-reports-and-atomic-sites&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the historical and statistical connections between reports of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and locations associated with atomic technology, primarily in the United States. It examines how early speculation linked UFO sightings to atomic sites, the influence of the Cold War, and various incidents and studies that have fueled this correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section establishes the context for the link between UFO reports and atomic sites. It highlights the increased scrutiny of US airspace due to national security concerns in 1947, coinciding with increased media coverage of UFO reports. It notes that the development of atomic weapons and long-range vehicles meant that even a small number of adversarial overflights could have significant national security implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1940s-weapons-development&#34;&gt;1940s weapons development &lt;a href=&#34;#1940s-weapons-development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the development of atomic weapons by the US during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. Key locations mentioned are Oak Ridge, Tennessee (uranium enrichment), Hanford, Washington (plutonium production), and Los Alamos, New Mexico (bomb design and construction). It also discusses the increased lethality and range of air power during the war and Japan&amp;rsquo;s deployment of intercontinental balloon bombs, one of which interfered with plutonium production at Hanford. The US&amp;rsquo;s Project Mogul, inspired by the Japanese balloons, aimed to detect Soviet atomic tests. The section also mentions German advancements in rockets, jet fighters, and bomber designs, which both the US and Soviet governments learned about and utilized after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;increased-scrutiny-of-us-airspace&#34;&gt;Increased scrutiny of US airspace &lt;a href=&#34;#increased-scrutiny-of-us-airspace&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains how the possibility of a Soviet atomic attack led to increased surveillance of US airspace, particularly around atomic facilities. It mentions the development of the first intercontinental bomber, the Convair B-36 Peacemaker, which could reach the Soviet Union from American soil. Atomic sites were among the first locations in the US to operate radar, supported by visual spotters and fighter squadrons. The start of the Cold War in 1947 influenced media coverage of UFO reports, treating them as potential national security threats rather than folklore or tall tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents a timeline of notable UFO incidents and their connection to atomic sites, starting in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;supposed-flying-discs-allegedly-break-sound-barrier&#34;&gt;Supposed flying discs allegedly break sound barrier &lt;a href=&#34;#supposed-flying-discs-allegedly-break-sound-barrier&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the Kenneth Arnold sighting in June 1947, where he reported seeing nine objects flying at supersonic speeds near Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in Washington state. The proximity of this sighting to the Hanford plutonium plant led to media speculation about a connection. The section also notes that the sound barrier was not officially broken until October 1947 by Chuck Yeager, and the Air Force initially denied the achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roswell-and-atomic-weapons&#34;&gt;Roswell and atomic weapons &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-and-atomic-weapons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the Roswell incident in July 1947, where debris was found on a ranch near Corona, New Mexico. The 509th at Roswell was the Army&amp;rsquo;s atomic bomb group. The initial explanation of a weather balloon was later questioned, and the Air Force eventually concluded the debris came from a Project Mogul balloon designed to detect Soviet atomic tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;public-claims-of-link-to-atomic-sites&#34;&gt;Public claims of link to atomic sites &lt;a href=&#34;#public-claims-of-link-to-atomic-sites&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the public&amp;rsquo;s perception of a link between flying discs and atomic weaponry in 1947. It mentions headlines claiming a connection between &amp;ldquo;discs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;atom products,&amp;rdquo; citing an unnamed scientist from the Manhattan Project who suggested experiments in atomic energy transmutation were responsible for the sightings. The Hanford works were also mentioned as a location with numerous UFO reports. Atomic scientists Harold Urey and David E. Lilienthal dismissed these claims as &amp;ldquo;gibberish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mantell-crash-near-oak-ridge&#34;&gt;Mantell crash near Oak Ridge &lt;a href=&#34;#mantell-crash-near-oak-ridge&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Mantell incident in January 1948, where Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a pilot from Fort Knox, Kentucky, crashed while pursuing a UFO near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Air Force later attributed the UFO to a Skyhook balloon, a classified project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;green-fireballs-near-hanford&#34;&gt;Green Fireballs near Hanford &lt;a href=&#34;#green-fireballs-near-hanford&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses reports of green fireballs near Hanford, Washington, starting in December 1948. It mentions Lincoln LaPaz&amp;rsquo;s investigation of these reports and the issuance of orders to fire on potentially hostile aircraft over Hanford and Oak Ridge. The section also notes UFO reports over Hanford and Oak Ridge during the early days of the Korean War and a 1952 Life Magazine article reporting unusual radar returns near an atomic installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contactees-and-nuclear-war&#34;&gt;Contactees and nuclear war &lt;a href=&#34;#contactees-and-nuclear-war&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the theme of nuclear war in UFO culture. The 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; featured a benevolent spaceman warning about atomic weapons. George Adamski began claiming contact with &amp;ldquo;space brothers&amp;rdquo; concerned about atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;big-sur-missile-test&#34;&gt;Big Sur missile test &lt;a href=&#34;#big-sur-missile-test&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a reported UFO incident during a 1964 Air Force missile test near Big Sur, California. Robert Jacobs, who oversaw the team, claimed a UFO interfered with the test. Kingston George, the project engineer, argued the team had actually recorded the release of decoy warheads and chaff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;malmstrom-missile-malfunction&#34;&gt;Malmstrom missile malfunction &lt;a href=&#34;#malmstrom-missile-malfunction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses UFO reports over a missile complex in March 1967 during a routine malfunction. Retired Air Force personnel later claimed the weapons failure was caused by a UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hynek-suggests-atomic-link&#34;&gt;Hynek suggests atomic link &lt;a href=&#34;#hynek-suggests-atomic-link&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes that astronomer J. Allen Hynek, initially hired by the Air Force to debunk UFO reports, began speculating in 1968 that UFOs might be related to an unknown phenomenon connected to nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rendelsham&#34;&gt;Rendelsham &lt;a href=&#34;#rendelsham&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the Rendlesham Forest incident in December 1980, a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights near RAF Woodbridge in England, which was used by the United States Air Force (USAF). USAF personnel, including Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt, claimed to see things they described as a UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers more recent developments, including a legend that the 1945 Trinity atomic bomb test brought down an alien spacecraft. It mentions Robert Hastings&amp;rsquo; book &lt;em&gt;UFOs &amp;amp; Nukes: Extraordinary Encounters at Nuclear Weapons Sites&lt;/em&gt; and claims by former AATIP director Luis Elizondo and former U.S. Air Force personnel that UAPs have interfered with nuclear capabilities. It also notes reports of UFOs interfering with other major powers&amp;rsquo; nuclear weapons systems. The section mentions the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act requesting more information on UAP incidents associated with military nuclear assets and claims by Robert L. Salas and Robert Hastings of alien abduction. Finally, it mentions that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission will raise the issue of UAP with its United States counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;statistical-studies&#34;&gt;Statistical studies &lt;a href=&#34;#statistical-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the statistical evidence for a correlation between UFO reports and atomic sites, considering the possibility of observational bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It introduces the concept of the &amp;ldquo;streetlight effect,&amp;rdquo; where observations are more likely to be reported where observations are most likely to occur. Mainstream experts argue that increased scrutiny of airspace around strategically important facilities explains the correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section mentions a rudimentary spatial analysis conducted by Air Force officers in the 1950s, which found that UFOs were seen more frequently around areas vital to US defense, such as Los Alamos-Albuquerque, Oak Ridge, and White Sands Proving Ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 study of UFO reports in France concluded that there was a statistically significant link between nuclear activities and unexplained UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 document from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence suggested that clustering of UFO reports around US training and testing grounds might be due to &amp;ldquo;collection bias as a result of focused attention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study examined a National UFO Reporting Center dataset and found that UFO reports are more frequent in areas with darker nighttime skies and &amp;ldquo;wide-open spaces.&amp;rdquo; Additionally, analysis suggested that proximity to airports and military installations was linked to increased UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept dates back to the 2nd century AD with Lucian of Samosata&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A True Story&lt;/em&gt;. Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Le Micromégas&lt;/em&gt; (1752) features an alien from Sirius visiting Earth and engaging in philosophical discussions with humans. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; is traditionally credited with popularizing the trope of conflict between humans and alien intelligent species, although earlier examples exist, such as &lt;em&gt;Les Xipéhuz&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1950s saw a surge in first contact stories in the United States, often reflecting Cold War anxieties about nuclear holocaust or communist invasion. Films like &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; (1951) began to portray first contact as potentially beneficial, while &lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/em&gt; (1956) reflected fears of communist infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt; depicts both positive and negative consequences of first contact, while Stanisław Lem&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Solaris&lt;/em&gt; explores the futility of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise introduced the Prime Directive, a non-interference regulation, which has since become a common trope in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later works include &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; (1985), and novels like &lt;em&gt;The Sparrow&lt;/em&gt; (1996) and &lt;em&gt;The Three-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt; (2006). Films like &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; (2016) focus on the linguistic challenges of first contact. &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; (2021) depicts an unintended first contact scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-and-themes&#34;&gt;Types and Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#types-and-themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact stories vary widely in their methods of contact and the nature of the subsequent interaction. These variations include positive vs. negative outcomes, physical meetings vs. message interception, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien invasion is a common early trope, popularized by &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. During the Cold War, these stories often reflected American anxieties about the Soviet Union, with infiltration narratives being a variation on the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-artifacts&#34;&gt;Alien Artifacts &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-artifacts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bracewell probes, hypothesized by Ronald N. Bracewell, are extraterrestrial artifacts that allow real-time communication. Big Dumb Objects, such as megastructures like ringworlds, are a common variation. &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; features mysterious black Monoliths that enhance technological progress. Stories also involve finding alien spacecraft, such as in &lt;em&gt;Rendezvous with Rama&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication-with-alien-intelligence&#34;&gt;Communication with Alien Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#communication-with-alien-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stories deal with the challenges of communication. Stanisław Lem&amp;rsquo;s works often portray mutual understanding between humans and aliens as impossible, criticizing the idea of cognitive universality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;message-from-space&#34;&gt;Message from Space &lt;a href=&#34;#message-from-space&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact may occur through the detection of an extraterrestrial signal or technosignature. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) began with the advent of radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alien-languages&#34;&gt;Alien Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages are a common form of communication with aliens, and many stories explore language issues. While space operas often use universal translators, hard science fiction typically depicts the difficulties of communicating with aliens, which can lead to misunderstandings and even war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ethics-of-first-contact&#34;&gt;Ethics of First Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#ethics-of-first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many writers have considered how humans should treat aliens upon first contact. The Prime Directive of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; is a notable example of non-interference. In Soviet science fiction, &amp;ldquo;progressors&amp;rdquo; worked clandestinely to improve less advanced civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-examples&#34;&gt;Notable Examples &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-examples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-the-earth-stood-still&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-day-the-earth-stood-still&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the short story &amp;ldquo;Farewell to the Master,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; depicts the arrival of Klaatu and Gort in Washington, D.C. Humanity&amp;rsquo;s hostile response to first contact is used as an allegory for the Second Red Scare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1977 film by Steven Spielberg tells the story of Roy Neary, whose life changes after an encounter with a UFO. The film was deemed &amp;ldquo;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&amp;rdquo; by the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 novel, later adapted into a film, depicts the reception of a radio signal from Vega and the construction of a Machine based on the message&amp;rsquo;s specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;star-trek&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact is central to Starfleet operations in the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise. The Prime Directive is a foundational regulation, though it is frequently violated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-the-original-series&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-the-original-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original pilot episode features the Talosians. The Prime Directive was introduced in &amp;ldquo;The Return of the Archons&amp;rdquo; to prevent negative consequences from contact with technologically inferior societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-the-next-generation&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-the-next-generation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot episode, &amp;ldquo;Encounter at Farpoint,&amp;rdquo; depicts first contact with the Q Continuum. Episodes like &amp;ldquo;Who Watches the Watchers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; center on the Prime Directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-first-contact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1996 film portrays first contact between humans and Vulcans, leading to the formation of the United Federation of Planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-war-of-the-worlds&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-war-of-the-worlds&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; novel details a conflict between humankind and Martians. It has been adapted into numerous films, radio dramas, and other media. The 1938 radio drama, directed by Orson Welles, reportedly caused panic among listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-travis-walton-incident&#34;&gt;The Travis Walton Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#the-travis-walton-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Travis Walton incident is an alleged alien abduction that occurred on November 5, 1975, involving American forestry worker Travis Walton in the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests near Heber, Arizona. The incident is widely considered a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the alleged abduction, noting that in the early 1970s, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; tabloid offered a substantial prize for proof of extraterrestrial visitors, which may have motivated the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34;&gt;Travis Walton and the Turkey Springs forestry job &lt;a href=&#34;#travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the circumstances surrounding Travis Walton&amp;rsquo;s employment and the forestry contract. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; The forestry job was located in Turkey Springs, about 12 miles south of Heber, Arizona. The crew lived in Snowflake, 30 miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis Walton, his brother Duane, and crew chief Michael H. Rogers are central figures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Motive:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers&amp;rsquo;s forestry contract was behind schedule, potentially leading to financial penalties. The section notes that Walton had a prior criminal record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The Turkey Springs job involved thinning 1,277 acres by August 1975, later extended to November 10. Failure to complete the job could result in a $2,500 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Barney Hill and NBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the potential influence of the 1975 NBC television movie &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt;, which dramatized the alleged abduction of Barney and Betty Hill. It suggests that the film may have inspired Walton and Rogers to fabricate their own abduction story. Skeptics and psychologists are quoted arguing that the film could have motivated someone to claim an abduction for attention. It also mentions that Travis Walton told his mother not to worry if he were ever abducted by aliens because he would return safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the events of November 5, 1975, when Michael H. Rogers reported Travis Walton missing. The crew claimed they saw a lit object near the roadway, Walton approached it, and was struck by a light. The crew drove away in fear and returned to find Walton and the object gone. The police were notified, and a search was initiated. Deputy Kenneth Coplan noted the calm reaction of Walton&amp;rsquo;s mother to the news of his disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-person-investigation&#34;&gt;Missing person investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-person-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the search efforts and initial investigation following Walton&amp;rsquo;s disappearance. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Party:&lt;/strong&gt; A search party of nearly 50 people scoured the Turkey Springs area without success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&amp;rsquo;s Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Law enforcement were surprised by the calm reaction of Travis&amp;rsquo;s mother, who believed he was no longer on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFO Interest:&lt;/strong&gt; It was revealed that Travis, Duane, and their mother were interested in UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers and the crew underwent polygraph examinations to determine if they had harmed Walton. Five were deemed truthful, while one was inconclusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act of God Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers discussed the Forestry contract and the potential for an &amp;ldquo;Act of God&amp;rdquo; clause to excuse the delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walton-returns&#34;&gt;Walton returns &lt;a href=&#34;#walton-returns&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes Walton&amp;rsquo;s reappearance and subsequent events. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton called his sister&amp;rsquo;s home from a payphone in Heber, Arizona, on November 12, shortly after midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deputy Glen Flake:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy Flake witnessed Duane Walton transferring fuel from one car to another after having forgotten to purchase gas before local stations closed. Flake did not reveal that they knew Travis had returned home, and Duane did not tell the deputy that Travis had been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Duane sought medical attention for Travis, consulting with a hypnotherapist and later two medical doctors who were also amateur UFO investigators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheriff Gillespie:&lt;/strong&gt; Sheriff Gillespie insisted on interviewing Travis, but Duane and Travis demanded that the interview not be recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; provided a suite at the Sheraton Inn in Scottsdale in exchange for exclusive access to Walton and his story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis skipped a polygraph interview with police, but was later interviewed by Jack McCarthy a free-lance polygraph examiner arranged by a UFO group and the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;. McCarthy concluded that Travis was engaged in a &amp;ldquo;gross deception&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Television Interview:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton appeared on Phoenix television, claiming he lost consciousness and awoke in a hospital-like room with short, bald creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publicity-and-popular-culture&#34;&gt;Publicity and popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the media attention and cultural impact of the Walton incident. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for &amp;ldquo;best UFO case of the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism:&lt;/strong&gt; Skeptics, including Philip J. Klass, viewed the story as a hoax for financial gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book and Film:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton wrote &lt;em&gt;The Walton Experience&lt;/em&gt; in 1978, which was adapted into the 1993 film &lt;em&gt;Fire in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Appearances:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton has appeared at UFO conventions and on television, including &lt;em&gt;The Moment of Truth&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; podcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details a public dispute between Mike Rogers and Travis Walton in 2021. Rogers initially recanted his status as a witness to the abduction, claiming it was a hoax, but later reconciled with Walton and retracted his confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;modern-views&#34;&gt;Modern views &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents contemporary perspectives on the Walton incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;waltons-as-ufo-buffs-and-pranksters&#34;&gt;Waltons as UFO buffs and pranksters &lt;a href=&#34;#waltons-as-ufo-buffs-and-pranksters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the Walton family&amp;rsquo;s interest in UFOs and their reputation for pranks. It suggests that the incident may have been planned by Travis Walton and Mike Rogers. Crew member Steve Pierce expressed suspicion that the incident had been a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-enquirer-misrepresented-polygraph-results&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; misrepresented polygraph results &lt;a href=&#34;#national-enquirer-misrepresented-polygraph-results&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes that the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; publicized the opinion of a private polygraph examiner who reported the witnesses as being truthful, but omitted all mention of Walton&amp;rsquo;s prior polygraph examiner who concluded Walton was being &amp;ldquo;grossly deceptive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contrast-with-alien-abduction-syndrome&#34;&gt;Contrast with alien abduction syndrome &lt;a href=&#34;#contrast-with-alien-abduction-syndrome&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section contrasts Walton&amp;rsquo;s account with typical alien abduction narratives, noting that Walton didn&amp;rsquo;t report paralysis, recovered memories, or other common elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-role-of-fire-lookout-tower&#34;&gt;Possible role of fire lookout tower &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-role-of-fire-lookout-tower&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents Robert Sheaffer&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis that Rogers and the Waltons used a nearby fire lookout tower to create the illusion of a UFO. Sheaffer suggests that Travis walked towards the tower, which was brightly lit, and an accomplice illuminated him with a spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;crop-circle&#34;&gt;Crop Circle &lt;a href=&#34;#crop-circle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crop circle, crop formation, or corn circle is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was first coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural causes or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the historical accounts of crop circles and related phenomena, dividing it into periods before the 20th century, the 20th century, and the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection covers early reports that could be considered precursors to modern crop circles. It mentions a 1678 news pamphlet, &lt;em&gt;The Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt;, which describes a crop whose stalks were cut in a circular pattern. It also references a 1686 report by naturalist Robert Plot on rings of mushrooms, proposing air flows as a cause. An 1880 letter to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by John Rand Capron describes circles of flattened crops possibly caused by &amp;ldquo;cyclonic wind action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;20th-century&#34;&gt;20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details observations and reports of crop circles and similar phenomena throughout the 20th century. It mentions a 1932 observation by archaeologist E. C. Curwen of dark rings in a field. David Wood reported making crop circles in 1940. Patrick Moore described circular areas of flattened wheat near a crater in Wiltshire in 1963, suggesting air currents as a cause. Reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada during the 1960s are noted. The 1966 Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo; case is described, where a farmer reported witnessing a saucer-shaped craft leaving a circular area of flattened grass. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley claimed to have started creating crop circles in 1978, inspired by the Tully case. The 1974 film &lt;em&gt;Phase IV&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned as a possible inspiration for the pranksters. The late 1970s saw an increase in crop circle reports, which became widely known in the late 1980s. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles had been reported internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection covers the evolution of crop circles in the 21st century. It notes that crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring thousands of shapes and incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics. Jeremy Northcote&amp;rsquo;s research found that crop circles in the UK tend to appear near roads, populated areas, and cultural heritage monuments, suggesting human causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bower-and-chorley&#34;&gt;Bower and Chorley &lt;a href=&#34;#bower-and-chorley&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, who claimed to have started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978. They used simple tools like a plank of wood, rope, and a wire-fitted baseball cap. In 1991, they demonstrated their method to journalists. A &amp;ldquo;cereologist,&amp;rdquo; Pat Delgado, declared their circle authentic before it was revealed as a hoax. Bower and Chorley claimed responsibility for all circles made prior to 1987 and over 200 crop circles between 1978 and 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;art-and-business&#34;&gt;Art and business &lt;a href=&#34;#art-and-business&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the artistic and commercial aspects of crop circles. It notes that after simple circles in the 1970s, increasingly complex geometric designs have been created, sometimes to attract tourists. The UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles as art and for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set features an image of a crop circle. A crop-circle-making competition was held in Berkshire in 1992. In 2002, the Discovery Channel commissioned MIT graduate students to create crop circles. In 2009, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that crop circle activity was waning in Wiltshire as makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies. The 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony featured crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A Star Wars Rebel Alliance emblem crop circle was created in California in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;legal-implications&#34;&gt;Legal implications &lt;a href=&#34;#legal-implications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the legal consequences related to creating crop circles. In 1992, Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos were sued for creating a crop circle in Hungary, but the judge ruled they were only responsible for the damage within the circle itself. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first person in the UK arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle and was fined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the various explanations for how crop circles are created, dividing it into human origins, natural origins, and alternative explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-origin&#34;&gt;Human origin &lt;a href=&#34;#human-origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the scientific consensus that crop circles are constructed by humans as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most common method involves using a rope and board to flatten the plants. Skeptics point out that all characteristics of crop circles are compatible with human creation. Bower and Chorley&amp;rsquo;s confession is mentioned, as well as the increasing complexity of circles after their revelation. The main criticism of non-human creation is the lack of evidence, while many are known to be human-made. Cases where researchers declared circles &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; only to be confronted with the hoaxers are noted. Carl Sagan concluded that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats. &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; published an article by Matt Ridley, who described how easy it is to create convincing crop circles. Some crop formations are paid for by companies for advertising. Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-origins&#34;&gt;Natural origins &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores natural explanations for crop circles, including weather and animal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather &lt;a href=&#34;#weather&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sub-subsection discusses the suggestion that crop circles may be the result of meteorological phenomena like tornadoes or ball lightning, but there is no evidence of this. John Rand Capron blamed circles on a storm in 1880. Terence Meaden proposed that whirlwinds caused the circles. Stephen Hawking said that crop circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air. Meaden conceded that complex designs were made by hoaxers after Bower and Chorley&amp;rsquo;s confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;animal-activity&#34;&gt;Animal activity &lt;a href=&#34;#animal-activity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sub-subsection mentions that wallabies in Tasmania have been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies after consuming them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-explanations&#34;&gt;Alternative explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers alternative, less conventional explanations for crop circles, including paranormal theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paranormal&#34;&gt;Paranormal &lt;a href=&#34;#paranormal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic speculations about crop circles, ranging from bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. Some speculate that crop circles are related to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates believe that ball lightning causes crop circles and that the patterns are controlled by some entity, such as Gaia, God, supernatural beings, the collective minds of humanity, or extraterrestrial beings. The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &amp;ldquo;man-made.&amp;rdquo; Sceptical groups and scientists criticize hypothetical explanations as pseudoscientific. No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes-to-crops&#34;&gt;Changes to crops &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-to-crops&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses claims by some scientists that there are differences between crops inside and outside the circles, suggesting they were not man-made. William Levengood published papers finding deformities in the grain inside the circles correlated to their position. Joe Nickell objected that correlation is not causation and criticized Levengood&amp;rsquo;s methods and assumptions. Advocates of non-human causes dismiss on-site evidence of human involvement as attempts to discredit the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;related-art&#34;&gt;Related art &lt;a href=&#34;#related-art&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions that patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow or sand. Images can be made in forests by cutting trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;folklore&#34;&gt;Folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the connection between modern crop circles and old folkloric tales. Crop circles are culture-dependent, appearing mostly in developed and secularized Western countries. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, which may be the origin of tales of &amp;ldquo;fairie rings.&amp;rdquo; A 17th-century English woodcut, the &lt;em&gt;Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt;, depicts the devil mowing a circular design in a field of oats. In the 1948 German story &lt;em&gt;Die zwölf Schwäne&lt;/em&gt;, a farmer finds a circular ring of flattened grain in his field every morning, caused by princesses disguised as swans dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ancient astronauts</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_96b21753a786/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ancient-astronauts&#34;&gt;Ancient Astronauts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-astronauts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected the development of cultures, technologies, religions, and even human biology. A common idea is that deities in many religions were actually extraterrestrials, and their advanced technologies were seen as divine powers by early humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is rejected by academics and archaeologists, who consider it pseudoarchaeology and unscientific. Claims are often based on distorted or fabricated evidence. Some critics argue that ancient astronaut theories have racist implications, diminishing the achievements of indigenous cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable proponents in the late 20th century include Robert Charroux, Jacques Bergier, Jean Sendy, Erich von Däniken, Alexander Kazantsev, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, David Hatcher Childress, Peter Kolosimo, and Mauro Biglino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers often claim that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence that landed on Earth in the past. They suggest that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these ancient alien visitors, who acted as a &amp;ldquo;mother culture.&amp;rdquo; Proponents also claim that extraterrestrials built or helped humans build structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island. Evidence is said to come from gaps in historical and archaeological records, as well as artifacts that are considered anachronistic and beyond the technical capabilities of ancient people. These &amp;ldquo;out-of-place artifacts&amp;rdquo; include artwork and legends reinterpreted to support extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is featured in fringe media, such as the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The show mixes fact with fiction to promote theories of an alternate past, often incorporating white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents portray themselves as an oppressed minority of academics challenging mainstream archaeology, despite lacking credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like past archaeological endeavors, the focus is on monumental structures, suggesting that indigenous people could not have built them without alien help. However, some indigenous voices argue that ancient alien theory supports their stories of extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme is the portrayal of aliens as light-skinned or Aryan, as claimed by Erich von Däniken. Some proponents are associated with white supremacism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream archaeologists have largely ignored these claims, while popular science explainers and skeptics have criticized them. Carl Sagan noted that cases of apparent interest have reasonable alternative explanations, misreporting, or are hoaxes and distortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34;&gt;History of Ancient Aliens Beliefs and Their Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleocontact narratives appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt; (1898) and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It gained popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and Erich von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s works. Critics emerged in the 1970s, discrediting Von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s claims. By the early 1980s, support dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shklovskii-and-sagan&#34;&gt;Shklovskii and Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#shklovskii-and-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan co-authored &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966) with Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky. In &lt;em&gt;Broca&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1979), Sagan expressed disapproval of writers like von Däniken who treated speculations as valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact. Sagan noted that many legends, artifacts, and out-of-place artifacts cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses could be explained with conventional hypotheses. He reiterated that extraterrestrial visits were possible but unproven and improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;erich-von-däniken&#34;&gt;Erich von Däniken &lt;a href=&#34;#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erich von Däniken became a leading proponent in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his book &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; (1968) and its sequels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken argued that certain artifacts required more advanced technology than was available to ancient cultures. He claimed that these artifacts were constructed by extraterrestrial visitors or humans who learned from them. Examples include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote that ancient art and iconography depict air and space vehicles, intelligent non-human creatures, ancient astronauts, and advanced technology. He also stated that geographically separated cultures share artistic themes, implying a common origin. One example is his interpretation of the sarcophagus lid from the tomb of Pacal the Great in Palenque, which he saw as a seated astronaut, while Maya texts identify it as a portrait of the ruler with the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken interpreted the origins of many religions as reactions to encounters with an alien race, whose technology was seen as supernatural. He stated that religious traditions contain references to alien visitors, such as Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s revelation, which he interpreted as a landing spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. through the NBC-TV documentary &lt;em&gt;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; and the film &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, made unfounded claims, and failed to validate his core claims. Christian creationists also criticized his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Nazca Lines, von Däniken stated that they resembled an airfield when seen from the air. Kenneth L. Feder argues that readers seeing the Nazca Lines in a book about aliens would be more likely to associate them with extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, von Däniken admitted that the Nazca markings could have been laid out using a system of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Earth Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; series revolves around his interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts. He hypothesized that the gods of Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet Nibiru, which the Sumerians believed to be a remote &amp;ldquo;12th planet&amp;rdquo; associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru orbits the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin argued that Sumerian texts tell the story of 50 Anunnaki from Nibiru who came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago to mine raw materials, especially gold. They genetically engineered laborers, creating &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/em&gt;: the &amp;ldquo;Adapa&amp;rdquo; or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended that the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the end of the last ice age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been criticized by professionals. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s translations are inconsistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan F. Alford, author of &lt;em&gt;Gods of the New Millennium&lt;/em&gt;, initially adhered to Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses but later found fault, stating that the gods personified the falling sky and that the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;robert-temple&#34;&gt;Robert Temple &lt;a href=&#34;#robert-temple&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert K. G. Temple&amp;rsquo;s 1976 book, &lt;em&gt;The Sirius Mystery,&lt;/em&gt; argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He cites advanced astronomical knowledge, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations. His work draws on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies and suggest that the Dogon may have received their astronomical information recently from European sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various new religious movements, including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, Raëlism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate, believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many see ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities suggesting that members associate enchantment with science fiction memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;claims-of-proponents&#34;&gt;Claims of Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#claims-of-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; cited as evidence can be explained without invoking ancient astronauts. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ancient-religious-texts&#34;&gt;Ancient Religious Texts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-religious-texts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents cite ancient mythologies, suggesting that creation myths of gods descending from the heavens to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors. They draw an analogy to cargo cults, where isolated cultures believed Western ships and cargo were sent from the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Sumerian myth of &lt;em&gt;Enûma Eliš&lt;/em&gt; says humankind was created to serve gods called the &amp;ldquo;Annunaki.&amp;rdquo; Proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to Earth to mine gold and created the human race as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ramayana&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ramayana&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel in flying vehicles called Vimana. The &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; mentions these flying objects, used by the Lankan king Ravana from Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples from the &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; include descriptions of the Pushpak chariot, a&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Fictional Depictions of Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses extraterrestrials as they are portrayed in works of fiction, distinguishing them from alleged real-life encounters. It includes a link to a separate article listing alleged extraterrestrial beings. A banner at the top indicates that the article relies heavily on a limited number of sources and needs more citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical evolution of extraterrestrial depictions in fiction, starting from antiquity and progressing through modern times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;antiquity&#34;&gt;Antiquity &lt;a href=&#34;#antiquity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection covers early depictions of extraterrestrials, beginning with Lucian&amp;rsquo;s 2nd-century satire &lt;em&gt;True History&lt;/em&gt;, where the protagonist visits the Moon and finds it inhabited by warring factions. It emphasizes how early concepts of extraterrestrials were tied to the development of astronomy and the understanding of celestial objects as physical entities. Early depictions often portrayed aliens as human-like, as exemplified by Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Micromégas&lt;/em&gt; and works by Johannes Kepler, Francis Godwin, and Cyrano de Bergerac.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Fictional Depictions of Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses extraterrestrials as they appear in works of fiction, distinguishing them from alleged real-life encounters. It notes that the article relies heavily on a limited number of sources and encourages expansion with additional citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrials-in-fiction&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrials in Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrials-in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a general overview, defining an extraterrestrial (or alien) as a lifeform originating outside Earth. It highlights the prevalence of extraterrestrials as a theme in science fiction, with examples ranging from ancient works like Lucian of Samosata&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True History&lt;/em&gt; to modern depictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical evolution of extraterrestrial depictions in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;antiquity&#34;&gt;Antiquity &lt;a href=&#34;#antiquity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection traces the earliest portrayals of extraterrestrials, starting with Lucian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True History&lt;/em&gt;, which features a voyage to the Moon and a war between lunar and solar inhabitants. It explains how early concepts of aliens were tied to the development of astronomy and the initial tendency to imagine them as human-like. Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Micromégas&lt;/em&gt; and works by Johannes Kepler, Francis Godwin, and Cyrano de Bergerac are mentioned as examples where extraterrestrials differed from humans only in culture or size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; is discussed, noting how it revolutionized alien depictions by inspiring authors to imagine non-humanoid lifeforms based on evolutionary principles. Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s works and H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; are cited as early examples of genuinely alien lifeforms. The section also acknowledges that many works of the era still featured human-like aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; is further analyzed for its exploration of Darwinian evolution, its depiction of Martians as apex predators, and its critique of British imperialism. It also introduced the tropes of alien invasion and extraterrestrials as monsters. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The First Men in the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned as an early attempt to detail an alien civilization, drawing parallels to ant colonies. Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s contributions to science fiction and space exploration are also noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early 20th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the influence of pulp magazines on science fiction, highlighting the prevalence of quasi-human aliens, monstrous invaders, and the trope of human conquest of alien worlds. It mentions Ralph Milne Farley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Radio Man&lt;/em&gt; as an example. The section notes that most aliens in pulp magazines originated from planets or moons within the Solar System. Stanley G. Weinbaum&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A Martian Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is recognized for its unique Martian ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-times&#34;&gt;Modern Times &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-times&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the evolution of alien depictions in more recent times. &lt;em&gt;The Eternaut&lt;/em&gt; by Héctor Germán Oesterheld is highlighted as a pioneering work of alien invasion set in Buenos Aires, serving as a critique of imperialism and the military dictatorship in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barney and Betty Hill incident is discussed as the first recorded claim of alien abduction, leading to the &amp;ldquo;grey alien&amp;rdquo; archetype. Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s films &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&lt;/em&gt; are mentioned as influential works that popularized the grey alien image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of television and film on alien portrayals is explored, noting the trend towards human-like aliens due to budget constraints, particularly in the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; are mentioned as franchises that sustained public interest in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section concludes by discussing the influence of computer-generated imagery (CGI) on alien depictions, allowing for more bizarre and imaginative lifeforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien invasion</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_c423562fffa8/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien invasion, also known as space invasion, is a prevalent theme in science fiction stories and films. It involves extraterrestrial lifeforms invading Earth with various motives, such as exterminating or enslaving humanity, harvesting humans for food, stealing resources, or destroying the planet. This theme is a subgenre of invasion literature, popularized by H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, and is a type of first contact science fiction. Experts consider an actual alien invasion unlikely due to the immense costs involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the origins of the alien invasion theme in fiction. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; (1898) is considered the seminal alien invasion story, establishing themes like first contact and interplanetary war. However, earlier stories exist, such as Robert Potter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Germ Growers&lt;/em&gt; (1892), which features a covert alien invasion. The section also mentions Wells&amp;rsquo; proposed guerrilla war scenario in &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. Garrett P. Serviss&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt;, an unauthorized sequel to &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, depicts Thomas Edison leading a counterattack on Mars. The reprinting of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; in the United States in 1927 coincided with the Golden Age of Science Fiction. John W. Campbell and other science fiction writers, including Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Clifford D. Simak, and Robert A. Heinlein, further developed the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;variations&#34;&gt;Variations &lt;a href=&#34;#variations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores different variations of the alien invasion theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-infiltration&#34;&gt;Alien Infiltration &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-infiltration&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation involves invaders taking human form and infiltrating society, even taking control of command positions. Their goal may be to take over the world or prepare for a full-scale invasion. This theme reflects Cold War fears of communist infiltration. The Reptilian conspiracy theory is mentioned as a real-world belief in covert alien infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beneficial-alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Beneficial Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#beneficial-alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation presents aliens colonizing Earth to &amp;ldquo;civilize&amp;rdquo; humanity or secretly aiding humans to prevent self-destruction. Henry Slesar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Delegate from Venus&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned. Examples include Klaatu and Gort in &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;, Gene Roddenberry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Questor Tapes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; episode &amp;ldquo;Assignment: Earth&amp;rdquo;, Arthur C. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crest of the Stars&lt;/em&gt;, the film &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;, and David Brin&amp;rsquo;s Uplift Universe series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;invasion-by-humans&#34;&gt;Invasion by Humans &lt;a href=&#34;#invasion-by-humans&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation reverses the roles, with humans invading or attacking extraterrestrial lifeforms. Examples include the short story &lt;em&gt;Sentry&lt;/em&gt;, the video game &lt;em&gt;Phantasy Star II&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Martian Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; by Ray Bradbury, the Imperium of Man in the &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/em&gt; universe, &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Earth&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Silverberg, &lt;em&gt;Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game&lt;/em&gt; by Orson Scott Card, and the movies &lt;em&gt;Battle for Terra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Planet 51&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feasibility&#34;&gt;Feasibility &lt;a href=&#34;#feasibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the feasibility of an actual alien invasion. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute believes it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely due to resource availability and the likelihood of initial contact being through robots. David Morrison of NASA-Ames Research Center suggests first contact would be via radio communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-1956-film&#34;&gt;UFO (1956 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-1956-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1956 American semi-documentary film that explores the development of the UFO phenomenon in the United States. It is noted for its use of documentary clips that have been featured in other UFO-related media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins-and-plot&#34;&gt;Origins and plot &lt;a href=&#34;#origins-and-plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1952, Hollywood producer Clarence Greene, after witnessing an unusual aerial object, contacted US Air Force public information officer Albert M. Chop. Intrigued, Greene decided to create a documentary about UFOs, using film footage provided by Chop. The film begins in 1947, covering early UFO sightings like the Kenneth Arnold sighting, the Mantell UFO incident, and the Gorman Dogfight. It follows the evolution of UFOs as a cultural fad and a concern for the US Air Force, including the history of Project Sign. The film then focuses on Albert M. Chop, who is assigned as the public information officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Chop initially debunks UFOs but gradually changes his views, believing they are unknown aircraft, possibly extraterrestrial. By 1952, Chop is in Washington, D.C., as the press spokesman for Project Blue Book. The documentary analyzes the Mariana UFO Incident of 1950 and the 1952 UFO film taken near the Great Salt Lake in Utah by Delbert Newhouse. The film concludes with the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident, where Chop played a central role, ultimately stating his belief that UFOs are a real, physical phenomenon of unknown origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast includes Willis Sperry, Nicholas Mariana, Delbert Newhouse, Wendell Swanson, and U.S. Air Force General John A. Samford as themselves. Tom Towers plays Albert M. (Al) Chop, Floyd Burton plays Major Dewey Fournet, Gene Coughlan plays an editor from the &lt;em&gt;Dayton Daily News&lt;/em&gt;, Bert Freed plays a Colonel, Stan Gordon plays a reporter, Marie Kenna plays Mrs. Albert Chop, Harry Morgan provides voices, Robert Phillips plays Captain Edward Ruppelt, William Solomon plays a German scientist, and Olan Soule is a narrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actor Harry Morgan, known for his roles in &lt;em&gt;M*A*S*H&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dragnet 1967&lt;/em&gt;, voices the pilot of &amp;ldquo;Air Force 216&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Red Dog One&amp;rdquo; during key scenes, including the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident. Morgan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dragnet 1967&lt;/em&gt; co-star Jack Webb produced and narrated the 1978 television series &lt;em&gt;Project U.F.O.&lt;/em&gt;, which recreated Project Bluebook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien Trespass (2009 Film)</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_916dbe083330/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:41:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-trespass-2009-film&#34;&gt;Alien Trespass (2009 Film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-trespass-2009-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a description of the 2009 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Trespass&lt;/em&gt;, directed by R.W. Goodwin. The film is a science-fiction comedy that pays homage to the B movies of the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is set in 1957 in California&amp;rsquo;s Mojave Desert. Astronomer Ted Lewis and his wife Lana are observing a meteor shower when something crashes nearby. Ted investigates and discovers an alien spaceship. His body is then taken over by Urp, a well-meaning alien who is searching for Ghota, a one-eyed monster that escaped from the ship. Ghota consumes people to grow and multiply, threatening Earth. Urp enlists the help of Tammy, a local waitress, to stop Ghota. The local police, Chief Dawson and Officer Vern, are skeptical. Urp and Tammy hunt down Ghota, and they eventually fall in love. At the end, Urp returns to his home planet, leaving Tammy to pursue her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film stars Eric McCormack as Ted Lewis/Urp, Jenni Baird as Tammy, Robert Patrick as Vernon, Jody Thompson as Lana Lewis, and Dan Lauria as Chief Dawson. Other cast members include Sarah Smyth, Aaron Brooks, Andrew Dunbar, Dayna Reid, Chelah Horsdal, Sage Brocklebank, Jonathon Young, and Tom McBeath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film replicates the look and feel of 1950s science fiction films, with the exception of being in color. The film uses the trope of monsters terrorizing small desert towns, which was common in 1950s B movies due to lower production costs. The character of Lana Lewis is depicted as a &amp;ldquo;sexpot,&amp;rdquo; a common archetype in 1950s science fiction films. The Ghota is similar to B.O.B. from &lt;em&gt;Monsters vs. Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The romance between Urp and Tammy is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;. Director Goodwin states that the film takes elements from &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;It Came from Outer Space&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 38% approval rating, with the consensus being that it loses its charm due to tedious dialogue and cheesy special effects. Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, stating that it was a labor of love but questioning whether there was a demand for cheesy 1950s sci-fi movies. Jeannette Catsoulis of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; described the film as a charming but pointless homage. Betsy Sharkey of the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; felt that the film stayed too true to the era and genre, forgetting to entertain. IGN praised the film&amp;rsquo;s recreation of the 1950s aesthetic but found that it couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide whether to emulate or satirize the genre. Ty Burr of &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; felt that the film was superior to &lt;em&gt;Monsters vs. Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; gave the film a &amp;ldquo;B+&amp;rdquo; rating, praising its warm tone and anti-CGI look. Gary Westfahl considers the film an overlooked gem that captures the charm of 1950s science fiction films.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aurora, Texas, UFO incident</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_5c69099a06fb/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aurora-texas-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Aurora, Texas, UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#aurora-texas-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the alleged UFO crash that reportedly occurred on April 17, 1897, near Aurora, Texas. Locals claimed a UFO crashed on a farm, resulting in the death of its pilot, an alien being. The pilot was purportedly buried in the Aurora Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-incident-as-reported&#34;&gt;The Incident as Reported &lt;a href=&#34;#the-incident-as-reported&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts the details of the incident as reported in the &lt;em&gt;Dallas Morning News&lt;/em&gt; article written by S.E. Haydon. The article describes how a UFO crashed into a windmill on Judge J.S. Proctor&amp;rsquo;s property. The pilot, described as &amp;ldquo;not of this world,&amp;rdquo; was speculated to be from Mars by an Army Signal Service officer named T.J. Weems. The pilot was buried with Christian rites in the Aurora Cemetery, which now has a Texas Historical Commission marker mentioning the incident. The wreckage was reportedly dumped into a well on the property. Mr. Brawley Oates, who later purchased the property, sealed the well after developing severe arthritis, which he attributed to contamination from the wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hoax-theory&#34;&gt;Hoax Theory &lt;a href=&#34;#hoax-theory&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the theory that the Aurora incident was a hoax. It cites a 1980 &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine interview with Etta Pegues, an Aurora resident, who claimed that S.E. Haydon fabricated the story to revive the town&amp;rsquo;s economy after the railroad bypassed it. Pegues also claimed that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property, a statement that was later challenged. Paranormal researcher Jerry Drake challenged the finding that the well was designed for use with a windmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigations&#34;&gt;Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the various investigations into the Aurora incident, including reports by KDFW, &lt;em&gt;UFO Files&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kdfw-report&#34;&gt;KDFW Report &lt;a href=&#34;#kdfw-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, KDFW aired a report featuring interviews with Jim Marrs and other locals who believed something crashed in Aurora. The report found no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-files-investigation&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Files&lt;/em&gt; Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-files-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;UFO Files&lt;/em&gt; episode, &amp;ldquo;Texas&amp;rsquo; Roswell,&amp;rdquo; featured a 1973 investigation led by Bill Case of the &lt;em&gt;Dallas Times Herald&lt;/em&gt; and MUFON. The investigation uncovered two new eyewitnesses: Mary Evans, who spoke of her parents&amp;rsquo; visit to the crash site and the discovery of the alien body, and Charlie Stephens, who saw the airship trailing smoke. MUFON investigated the Aurora Cemetery and found a grave marker that appeared to depict a flying saucer. They requested permission to exhume the site but were denied. The marker later disappeared, and metal readings from the grave vanished. The report concluded that the evidence was inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-hunters-investigation&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-hunters-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; episode, &amp;ldquo;First Contact,&amp;rdquo; featured Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates, allowing investigators to unseal the well on his property. Water samples showed high levels of aluminum, but the well contained no significant debris. The remains of a windmill base were found near the well site. Ground-penetrating radar revealed an unmarked grave in the cemetery near other 1890s graves. The condition of the grave was badly deteriorated, and the radar could not conclusively prove what type of remains existed. The landowner provided pieces of metal containing mostly aluminum and an unknown element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section notes the dramatization of the incident in the 1986 film &lt;em&gt;The Aurora Encounter&lt;/em&gt; and its discussion in &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. It also mentions an independent short movie titled &lt;em&gt;Aurora&lt;/em&gt; by Thomas Negovan and Aaron Shaps, which combines the incident with the Nazi conspiracy theory of Die Glocke. The Firesign Theatre&amp;rsquo;s comedy LP &lt;em&gt;Everything You Know Is Wrong&lt;/em&gt; satirizes the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Varginha UFO incident</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_3cbfbc358e9c/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:39:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;varginha-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Varginha UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#varginha-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Varginha UFO incident refers to a series of events in 1996 in Varginha, Brazil, where residents reported sightings of strange creatures and at least one unidentified flying object (UFO). These reports gained significant media attention. Claims associated with the incident include the alleged capture of extraterrestrial beings by Brazilian authorities, animal fatalities at a zoo, and a woman becoming pregnant by an extraterrestrial. The Brazilian Army investigated the incident and concluded that a city resident was mistaken for an alien creature and that military activity in the area was routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 20, 1996, three women reported seeing a creature with a large head, bipedal stance, &amp;ldquo;spots like veins&amp;rdquo; on its skin, bumps on its head, and red eyes. The creature, later called the &amp;ldquo;ET de Varginha,&amp;rdquo; appeared unsteady, leading the women to believe it was injured or sick. They fled and told their mother they had seen the &amp;ldquo;devil.&amp;rdquo; Rumors spread about UFO sightings in the days prior. Claims emerged of additional creatures being captured and observed at a hospital, military activity in the area, an unidentified animal in a local forest, the death of a police officer, and unexplained animal deaths at the local zoo. Ufologists linked these claims, including the allegation that one of the initial witnesses became pregnant by the creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inquiry&#34;&gt;Inquiry &lt;a href=&#34;#inquiry&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official inquiry by the Brazilian military in 2010 concluded that the women encountered a homeless, mentally unstable man nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Mudinho.&amp;rdquo; The Commander of the 24th Police Battalion Military presented photographs of Mudinho, whose physical characteristics matched the description of the creature. The inquiry suggested that Mudinho, being dirty and crouching by a wall due to heavy rains, was mistaken for a space creature. The head of the inquiry stated that military trucks and personnel were performing routine duties, such as firefighters responding to a call, Army trucks undergoing maintenance, and vehicles departing from the Escola de Sargentos das Armas (EsSA). Skeptic Brian Dunning criticized sensational media accounts and ufologists&amp;rsquo; claims, arguing that the incident was magnified into unassailable proof of alien visitation despite a lack of unusual events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tourism&#34;&gt;Tourism &lt;a href=&#34;#tourism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims surrounding the Varginha incident have significantly impacted tourism in the city. Grey alien dolls in football uniforms are sold at the incident&amp;rsquo;s location. Grey alien designs are used in advertising campaigns for the municipality. Bus stops were built in the form of spaceships, and a 20-meter tall water tower with a disc-shaped water reservoir, called the Nave Espacial de Varginha, was erected in the town center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media&#34;&gt;Media &lt;a href=&#34;#media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several media productions have been inspired by the Varginha UFO incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;1996&lt;/em&gt;, a 2020 short film by Rodrigo Brandão, is a horror story in the style of &lt;em&gt;The Blair Witch Project&lt;/em&gt; about two teenagers who get lost in the woods near Varginha and encounter an extraterrestrial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incidente em Varginha&lt;/em&gt; is a video game inspired by the events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment of Contact&lt;/em&gt;, a 2022 documentary film by James Fox, investigates the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;O.V.N.I L&amp;rsquo;affaire Varginha&lt;/em&gt;, a French comic book by Philippe Auger, tells the story of the incident.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-the-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;UFO Legend Caused by 1947 Balloon Crash: The Roswell Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-the-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article delves into the Roswell incident, a cornerstone of UFO lore, tracing its origins from a 1947 military balloon crash to the elaborate conspiracy theories that persist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;newspaper-headline-and-incident-overview&#34;&gt;Newspaper Headline and Incident Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#newspaper-headline-and-incident-overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell Daily Record&amp;rsquo;s July 8, 1947, issue announced the &amp;ldquo;capture&amp;rdquo; of a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; by the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). The incident occurred between June 4 and July 10, 1947, in Lincoln County, New Mexico. The military balloon debris recovered near Roswell became the basis for conspiracy theories alleging the recovery of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1947-flying-disc-craze&#34;&gt;1947 Flying Disc Craze &lt;a href=&#34;#1947-flying-disc-craze&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident occurred during the 1947 flying disc craze, which included events such as the Kenneth Arnold sighting, the Flight 105 sighting, the Rhodes photographs, the Twin Falls hoax, and the Maury Island hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;Military Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#military-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, the United States launched Project Mogul balloons from Alamogordo Army Air Field to detect Soviet atomic tests. On June 4, researchers lost contact with a balloon train near Corona, New Mexico, where rancher W.W. &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Brazel later discovered debris. Initially unaware of the flying disc craze, Brazel consulted his uncle, Hollis Wilson, who suggested the debris might be from a &amp;ldquo;flying disk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazel reported his find to Sheriff George Wilcox, who contacted Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt were assigned to collect the material. RAAF public information officer Walter Haut issued a press release about the recovered &amp;ldquo;flying disc.&amp;rdquo; The announcement made international headlines but was retracted within a day, with the army claiming it was a weather balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Roger Ramey and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as pieces of a weather balloon at a press conference. The Roswell Daily Record noted the absence of engine or metal parts in the wreckage. Jesse Marcel described the wreckage as &amp;ldquo;parts of the weather device&amp;rdquo; composed of &amp;ldquo;tinfoil and broken wooden beams.&amp;rdquo; Colonel Marcellus Duffy at Wright Field identified the material as balloon equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1947 debris retrieval remained relatively obscure for three decades. Belief in UFO cover-ups by the US government became widespread. Hoaxes, legends, and stories of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico emerged. The 1947 incident was reinterpreted to fit the public&amp;rsquo;s increasingly conspiracy-minded outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34;&gt;Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1948 Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax introduced stories of recovered alien bodies. Con artists convinced Variety columnist Frank Scully to cover their fictitious crash. The hoax narrative included small grey humanoid bodies, metal stronger than any found on Earth, indecipherable writing, and a government coverup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hangar-18&#34;&gt;Hangar 18 &lt;a href=&#34;#hangar-18&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hangar 18&amp;rdquo; is a non-existent location that many later conspiracy theories allege housed extraterrestrial craft or bodies recovered from Roswell. The idea of alien corpses being stored in an Air Force morgue at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was mentioned in Scully&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Behind the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;, expanded in the 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Incident at Exeter&lt;/em&gt;, and became the basis for the 1968 science-fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Fortec Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1974, Robert Spencer Carr alleged that alien bodies recovered from the Aztec crash were stored in &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18&amp;rdquo; at Wright-Patterson. The Air Force explained that no &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18&amp;rdquo; existed at the base. The 1980 film &lt;em&gt;Hangar 18&lt;/em&gt; dramatized Carr&amp;rsquo;s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34;&gt;Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994) &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in Roswell was rekindled after ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel in 1978. Marcel stated that the &amp;ldquo;weather balloon&amp;rdquo; explanation was a cover story and that he now believed the debris was extraterrestrial. In 1979, Marcel was interviewed by Bob Pratt of the National Enquirer, bringing large-scale attention to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufologists interviewed Major Marcel&amp;rsquo;s son, Jesse A. Marcel Jr. M.D., who said that his father had shown him flying saucer debris, including &amp;ldquo;a small beam with purple-hued hieroglyphics on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman collaborated with William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Moore and Charles Berlitz to write the 1980 book &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt;. It popularized Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account and added the claimed discovery of alien bodies on the Plains of San Agustin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Roswell conspiracy book, released in October 1980, was &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore. The book argues that an extraterrestrial craft was flying over the New Mexico desert to observe nuclear weapons activity when a lightning strike killed the alien crew. It alleges that the US government engaged in a cover-up. The book claims that in some photographs, the debris recovered by Marcel had been substituted with the debris from a weather device. The book introduced alien bodies purportedly found by archaeologists on the Plains of San Agustin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;majestic-12-hoax&#34;&gt;Majestic 12 Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#majestic-12-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majestic 12 was the purported organization behind faked government documents delivered anonymously to multiple ufologists in the 1980s. All individuals who received the fake documents were connected to Bill Moore. After the publication of &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt;, Richard C. Doty and other individuals presenting themselves as Air Force Intelligence Officers approached Moore. They used the unfulfilled promise of hard evidence of extraterrestrial retrievals to recruit Moore, who kept notes on other ufologists and intentionally spread misinformation within the UFO community. The anonymously delivered documents detailed the creation of a likely fictitious Majestic 12 group formed to handle Roswell debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a 1989 Mutual UFO Network conference, Moore confessed that he had intentionally fed fake evidence of extraterrestrials to UFO researchers, including Paul Bennewitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;role-of-glenn-dennis&#34;&gt;Role of Glenn Dennis &lt;a href=&#34;#role-of-glenn-dennis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial claims of recovered alien bodies came from the secondhand accounts of &amp;ldquo;Barney&amp;rdquo; Barnett and &amp;ldquo;Pappy&amp;rdquo; Henderson after their deaths. In 1989, Friedman interviewed former mortician Glenn Dennis, who provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses. Dennis claimed to have received calls from the Air Base with questions about body preservation and inquiries about small or hermetically sealed caskets. In 1991, Dennis co-founded a UFO museum in Roswell along with Max Littell and former RAAF public affairs officer Walter Haut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis provided false names for the nurse who allegedly witnessed the autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;competing-accounts-and-schism&#34;&gt;Competing Accounts and Schism &lt;a href=&#34;#competing-accounts-and-schism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proliferation of competing Roswell accounts led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. The two leading UFO societies disagreed on the scenarios presented by Randle–Schmitt and Friedman–Berliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt published &lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt;. It sold 160,000 copies and served as the basis for the 1994 television film &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt;. Randle and Schmitt added testimony from 100 new witnesses. The book claimed that General Arthur Exon had been aware of debris and bodies, but Exon disputed his depiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crash-at-corona&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#crash-at-corona&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1992, Stanton Friedman released &lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored with Don Berliner. The book introduced new &amp;ldquo;witnesses&amp;rdquo; and added to the narrative by doubling the number of flying saucers to two, and the number of aliens to eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, Randle and Schmitt authored another book, &lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; which claimed a cargo plane delivered alien bodies to Dwight D. Eisenhower. The book abandoned the Barnett crash site on the Plains of San Agustin as lacking evidence. Randle and Schmitt proposed a new crash site 35 miles north of Roswell, based on statements from Jim Ragsdale and Frank Kaufman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-response&#34;&gt;Air Force Response &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Air Force provided official responses to Roswell conspiracy theories during the mid-1990s under pressure from New Mexico congressman Steven Schiff and the General Accounting Office (GAO). The initial 1994 USAF report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul. The following year, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&lt;/em&gt; supported this with extensive documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, the Air Force published a second report, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;. It detailed how eyewitness accounts of military personnel loading aliens into &amp;ldquo;body bags&amp;rdquo; matched the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s procedures for retrieving parachute test dummies in insulation bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34;&gt;Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present) &lt;a href=&#34;#later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pseudo-documentaries, most notably &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, have taken a major role in shaping popular opinion of Roswell. In 1995, British entrepreneur Ray Santilli claimed to have footage of an alien autopsy filmed after the 1947 Roswell crash. In a 2006 documentary, Santilli admitted that the footage was fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-after-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-day-after-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, retired army intelligence officer Philip J. Corso released &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;. Corso&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;UFO Legend Caused by 1947 Balloon Crash: Roswell Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident is a cornerstone of UFO lore, stemming from the recovery of debris near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Initially reported as a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; capture, the U.S. Army quickly retracted the statement, claiming it was a weather balloon. This event, coupled with subsequent government explanations and retractions, fueled decades of conspiracy theories alleging a cover-up of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1947-military-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;1947 Military Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#1947-military-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial event and its immediate aftermath. In 1947, rancher W.W. &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Brazel discovered debris on his property near Corona, New Mexico. The debris consisted of tinfoil, rubber, tape, and wooden beams. Unaware of the ongoing &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze,&amp;rdquo; Brazel initially didn&amp;rsquo;t connect the debris to UFOs. However, after visiting Corona, his uncle suggested it could be from a &amp;ldquo;flying disk.&amp;rdquo; Brazel reported the findings to Sheriff George Wilcox, who contacted Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAAF sent Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt to investigate. A press release issued by public information officer Walter Haut announced the military&amp;rsquo;s recovery of a &amp;ldquo;flying disc.&amp;rdquo; This announcement made international headlines but was quickly retracted. General Roger Ramey and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as a weather balloon at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the period between the initial incident and the rise of modern Roswell conspiracy theories. The Roswell debris retrieval faded from public attention for three decades. However, belief in government UFO cover-ups grew, fueled by hoaxes and legends of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico. The Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax introduced the idea of recovered alien bodies, which later became associated with Roswell. The concept of &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18,&amp;rdquo; a fictional location at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, emerged as a storage site for alien craft and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34;&gt;Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994) &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the resurgence of interest in Roswell and the development of modern conspiracy theories. In 1978, ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, who stated that the &amp;ldquo;weather balloon&amp;rdquo; explanation was a cover story and that he believed the debris was extraterrestrial. This interview, along with subsequent media attention, reignited interest in the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980 book &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore popularized Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account and added the claim of alien bodies found on the Plains of San Agustin. The book also connected Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account to Lydia Sleppy, a former teletype operator who claimed she was ordered to stop transmitting a story about crashed saucer wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Majestic 12 hoax, involving faked government documents, emerged in the 1980s, further fueling conspiracy theories. Glenn Dennis, a former mortician, provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses, which was endorsed by prominent Roswell ufologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing accounts of the Roswell incident led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. &lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt added testimony from new witnesses. &lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt; by Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner introduced the idea of two crashed saucers and eight aliens. &lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; by Randle and Schmitt proposed a new crash site and a different group of archaeologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-response&#34;&gt;Air Force Response &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the official government response to the growing Roswell conspiracy theories. Under pressure from New Mexico congressman Steven Schiff and the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Air Force published reports in the mid-1990s. The initial 1994 report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul, a military surveillance program. The 1995 report, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&lt;/em&gt;, supported this with documentation that narrowed the cause of the debris to a specific Mogul balloon train. The 1997 report, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;, detailed how eyewitness accounts of military personnel loading aliens into &amp;ldquo;body bags&amp;rdquo; matched the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s procedures for retrieving parachute test dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34;&gt;Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present) &lt;a href=&#34;#later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the continued development of Roswell theories and hoaxes in recent decades. &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, a pseudo-documentary, played a major role in shaping popular opinion of Roswell. The film centered around Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s hoaxed footage of an alien autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, retired army intelligence officer Philip J. Corso released &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, alleging that he was shown a nonhuman body and helped oversee a project to reverse engineer recovered crash debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other theories include Annie Jacobsen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Area 51: An Uncensored History of America&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Military Base&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a claim that Nazi doctor Josef Mengele was recruited by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce &amp;ldquo;grotesque, child-size aviators.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the explanations for the Roswell incident, focusing on Project Mogul and anthropomorphic dummies. The Air Force reports identified Project Mogul as the source of the 1947 debris and concluded that other alien crash accounts were likely misidentified military programs or accidents. The 1997 Air Force report concluded that the alleged &amp;ldquo;bodies&amp;rdquo; reported by later eyewitnesses came from memories of accidents involving military casualties and memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-impact&#34;&gt;Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the impact of the Roswell incident on tourism, commercialization, and popular fiction. Roswell&amp;rsquo;s tourism industry is based on ufology museums and businesses, as well as alien-themed iconography. A yearly UFO festival has been held since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident has been depicted in numerous films and television shows, including &lt;em&gt;Hangar 18&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widespread speculation of a cover-up led to United States presidents being questioned about the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;roswell-incident&#34;&gt;Roswell Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident refers to the events surrounding the crash of a military balloon near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. This event later became the basis for widespread conspiracy theories alleging the recovery of an extraterrestrial spacecraft by the United States military. The article explores the initial event, the subsequent development of UFO conspiracy theories, and the official explanations provided by the United States Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the Roswell incident, highlighting the initial newspaper headline that reported the &amp;ldquo;capture&amp;rdquo; of a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; by the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). It sets the stage for the timeline of events, which occurred between June 4 and July 10, 1947, in Lincoln County, New Mexico. The section also mentions the &amp;ldquo;1947 flying disc craze&amp;rdquo; and lists related events such as the Kenneth Arnold sighting, the Flight 105 sighting, and various hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-balloon-debris-recovered-in-1947&#34;&gt;Military Balloon Debris Recovered in 1947 &lt;a href=&#34;#military-balloon-debris-recovered-in-1947&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial event, explaining that military balloon debris was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. It clarifies that this debris later became the basis for conspiracy theories about a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft. The balloon was part of the top-secret Project Mogul, operated from Alamogordo Army Air Field, designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. The United States Army initially announced the possession of a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; but retracted the statement within a day, attributing the debris to a conventional weather balloon to obscure the true purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1947-military-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;1947 Military Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#1947-military-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the Roswell incident. It explains that by 1947, the United States had launched thousands of top-secret Project Mogul balloons to listen for Soviet atomic tests. On June 4, researchers at Alamogordo Army Air Field in New Mexico launched a long train of these balloons, which they lost contact with near Corona, New Mexico, where W.W. &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Brazel&amp;rsquo;s ranch was located. Brazel discovered tinfoil, rubber, tape, and thin wooden beams scattered across his ranch later that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazel, initially unaware of the &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze,&amp;rdquo; visited Corona on July 5, where his uncle suggested the debris could be from a &amp;ldquo;flying disk.&amp;rdquo; The next day, Brazel informed Sheriff George Wilcox of his discovery, who then contacted Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt were assigned to gather the material. On July 8, RAAF public information officer Walter Haut issued a press release stating that the military had recovered a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; near Roswell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also describes the press conference where General Roger Ramey, Colonel Thomas DuBose, and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as pieces of a weather balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains that the 1947 debris retrieval remained relatively obscure for three decades. Reporting ceased after the government provided a mundane explanation, and broader reporting on flying saucers declined rapidly after the Twin Falls saucer hoax. Despite this, belief in UFO cover-ups by the US government became widespread. Hoaxes, legends, and stories of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico emerged that later formed elements of the Roswell myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34;&gt;Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax in 1948, which introduced stories of recovered alien bodies that later became associated with Roswell. The hoax narrative included small grey humanoid bodies, metal stronger than any found on Earth, indecipherable writing, and a government coverup to prevent public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hangar-18&#34;&gt;Hangar 18 &lt;a href=&#34;#hangar-18&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18,&amp;rdquo; a non-existent location that many later conspiracy theories allege housed extraterrestrial craft or bodies recovered from Roswell. The idea of alien corpses from a crashed ship being stored in an Air Force morgue at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was mentioned in Scully&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Behind the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;, expanded in the 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Incident at Exeter&lt;/em&gt;, and became the basis for a 1968 science-fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Fortec Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34;&gt;Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994) &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the rekindling of interest in Roswell after ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel in 1978. Marcel stated that the &amp;ldquo;weather balloon&amp;rdquo; explanation from the press conference was a cover story and that he now believed the debris was extraterrestrial. The tabloid &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; brought large-scale attention to the Marcel story the following February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the first Roswell conspiracy book, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore, released in October 1980. The book argues that an extraterrestrial craft was flying over the New Mexico desert to observe nuclear weapons activity when a lightning strike killed the alien crew. It alleges that, after recovering the crashed alien technology, the US government engaged in a cover-up to prevent mass panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;majestic-12-hoax&#34;&gt;Majestic 12 Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#majestic-12-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Majestic 12, the purported organization behind faked government documents delivered anonymously to multiple ufologists in the 1980s. The anonymously delivered documents detailed the creation of a likely fictitious Majestic 12 group formed to handle Roswell debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;role-of-glenn-dennis&#34;&gt;Role of Glenn Dennis &lt;a href=&#34;#role-of-glenn-dennis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces Glenn Dennis, a former mortician who provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses endorsed by prominent Roswell ufologists. Dennis claimed to have received calls from the Air Base with questions about body preservation and inquiries about small or hermetically sealed caskets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;competing-accounts-and-schism&#34;&gt;Competing Accounts and Schism &lt;a href=&#34;#competing-accounts-and-schism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains that a proliferation of competing Roswell accounts led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. The two leading UFO societies disagreed on the scenarios presented by Randle–Schmitt and Friedman–Berliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1991. The book claimed that General Arthur Exon had been aware of debris and bodies, and it included Glenn Dennis&amp;rsquo;s claims of an alien autopsy and Grady Barnett&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;alien body&amp;rdquo; accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crash-at-corona&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#crash-at-corona&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Stanton Friedman&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored with Don Berliner, released in 1992. The book introduced new &amp;ldquo;witnesses&amp;rdquo; and added to the narrative by doubling the number of flying saucers to two, and the number of aliens to eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Randle and Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s 1994 book, &lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed a cargo plane delivered alien bodies to Dwight D. Eisenhower. The book abandoned the Barnett crash site on the Plains of San Agustin and proposed a new crash site 35 miles north of Roswell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-response&#34;&gt;Air Force Response &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s official responses to Roswell conspiracy theories during the mid-1990s. The initial 1994 USAF report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul, a military surveillance program. The following year, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&lt;/em&gt; supported this with extensive documentation that narrowed the cause of the debris to a specific Mogul balloon train launched on June 4, 1947, and lost near the Roswell debris field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34;&gt;Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present) &lt;a href=&#34;#later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses later theories and hoaxes related to the Roswell incident, including the &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; film and Philip J. Corso&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-autopsy&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the pseudo-documentary &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to have footage of an alien autopsy filmed after the 1947 Roswell crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-after-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-day-after-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Philip J. Corso&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, released in 1997. Corso alleged that he was shown a purportedly nonhuman body suspended in liquid inside a glass coffin and that he helped oversee a project to reverse engineer recovered crash debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;related-debunked-or-fringe-theories&#34;&gt;Related Debunked or Fringe Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#related-debunked-or-fringe-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions related debunked or fringe theories, including Annie Jacobsen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Area 51: An Uncensored History of America&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Military Base&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a claim that Nazi doctor Josef Mengele was recruited by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce &amp;ldquo;grotesque, child-size aviators&amp;rdquo; to cause hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides explanations for the Roswell incident, stating that secrecy around the 1947 debris recovery was due to Cold War military programs rather than aliens. It notes that UFO believers maintain that a spacecraft crashed near Roswell, and &amp;ldquo;Roswell&amp;rdquo; remains synonymous with UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-mogul&#34;&gt;Project Mogul &lt;a href=&#34;#project-mogul&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section identifies the crashed object from the 1947 incident as a Project Mogul device. Mogul was a military surveillance program employing high-altitude balloons to monitor nuclear tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthropomorphic-dummies&#34;&gt;Anthropomorphic Dummies &lt;a href=&#34;#anthropomorphic-dummies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains that the 1947 Roswell accounts did not mention alien bodies. The 1997 Air Force report concluded that the alleged &amp;ldquo;bodies&amp;rdquo; reported by later eyewitnesses came&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;calvine-ufo-photograph&#34;&gt;Calvine UFO photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#calvine-ufo-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Calvine UFO photograph, also known as the Calvine Sighting, refers to a reported UFO sighting near Calvine, Perthshire, Scotland, in August 1990. Two men reported witnessing a diamond-shaped craft while walking on the moors. They took photographs of the object as it hovered silently before ascending vertically and disappearing. The &lt;em&gt;Daily Record&lt;/em&gt; newspaper received the story and the original prints and negatives, which were then passed to the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The original materials disappeared, and the story was never published. Investigative journalist David Clarke has led efforts to locate the witnesses. The case gained public interest over the years, with partial documentation released by The National Archives in 2009. An original photograph was discovered by Clarke and published in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; in 2022, leading to significant media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-background&#34;&gt;Historical background &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Calvine sighting within the broader history of UFO photography. It mentions Nick Pope, a former Ministry of Defence desk officer, who included the Calvine sighting in his 1996 book, &lt;em&gt;Open Skies, Closed Minds&lt;/em&gt;. Pope described the sighting as intriguing and noted that the MOD&amp;rsquo;s analysis concluded the photos were likely genuine. The object was described as a solid craft, at least the size of a Harrier or Hawk fighter jet. Sean Kirkpatrick, former director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has suggested the image is a reflection and may have been doctored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-mod-files&#34;&gt;Release of MOD files &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-mod-files&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details how the Calvine case gained more public attention after 2008 when the National Archives began releasing MOD UFO reports. David Clarke supervised the release and publication of these files. Among the released documents were materials related to the Calvine sighting, including a government briefing and handwritten summary. Two poor-quality photocopies of images were also included. These files revealed that DI55, a branch of the Directorate of Scientific and Technical Intelligence (DSTI), investigated the images along with a RAF photo analyst agency. Clarke later explored the Calvine incident in his book, &lt;em&gt;The UFO Files&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2015-channel-5-documentary&#34;&gt;2015 Channel 5 documentary &lt;a href=&#34;#2015-channel-5-documentary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of information from the National Archives, along with publicity from Clarke and Pope, led to increasing public interest in the case. In 2015, the incident was featured in the Channel 5 documentary series &lt;em&gt;Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;. The episode, titled &amp;ldquo;Alien Cover-Up&amp;rdquo;, included interviews with Clarke and Pope and featured a reconstruction of the sighting. A graphic artist recreated the Calvine photograph for the program, which was later mistaken by some for a genuine image. Pope has speculated on potential links to the alleged Aurora project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery-of-the-calvine-photograph&#34;&gt;Discovery of the Calvine photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#discovery-of-the-calvine-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the renewed investigation led by David Clarke in 2018 to locate the missing photographs and witnesses. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s interest was sparked by a Defence Intelligence Officer&amp;rsquo;s claim that the witnesses had photographed a classified U.S. black project platform. Clarke and his team interviewed former MOD staff and conducted public searches. In 2020, Scottish UFOlogist Straiph Wilson launched a search for the hill walkers. Clarke eventually tracked down retired RAF Press Officer Craig Lindsay, who had kept the original photograph for over 32 years. Lindsay donated the print and other items to Sheffield Hallam University&amp;rsquo;s Special Collection. Andrew Robinson, a photographic specialist, produced high-resolution digital copies and conducted an in-depth analysis, concluding that the photograph is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-search-for-kevin-russell&#34;&gt;The search for Kevin Russell &lt;a href=&#34;#the-search-for-kevin-russell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for a person named Kevin Russell, whose name was written on the back of the original Calvine photograph. The name was believed to be that of one of the witnesses. Despite contacting over 400 people with that name, Clarke&amp;rsquo;s team was unable to identify the witness. A person named Kevin Russell who worked at a hotel in Pitlochry was identified, but he denied any knowledge of the UFO. Nick Pope acknowledges being aware of the name Kevin Russell but declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-program-documentary-2024&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Program&lt;/em&gt; documentary (2024) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-program-documentary-2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the documentary &lt;em&gt;The Program&lt;/em&gt; by James Fox, released in December 2024, which features the Calvine UFO case. Fox interviewed David Clarke and Robinson in Sheffield and Lindsay in Scotland. The film explores the U.S. congressional effort to uncover government knowledge about UFOs and UAPs and includes an in-depth review of the Calvine case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unidentified flying object</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 02:55:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; were initially used to describe UFOs, stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass a broader range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged later, gaining traction in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and earthbound explanations for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs, upon investigation, are identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. Studies have shown that misidentification of prosaic phenomena, often due to inexperience or misperception, is a primary factor in UFO sightings. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that thorough investigation often reveals less mystery than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and atmospheric optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians typically offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes objects moving through the sky in ancient Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts from the 16th century depicting celestial phenomena over Nuremberg and Basel, which some connect to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A report in the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in 1878, where a farmer described seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; In 1946, the Swedish military collected over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, referred to as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with the media frenzy surrounding Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting near Mount Rainier. Arnold described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers,&amp;rdquo; sparking widespread public interest. Weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred, involving the recovery of debris from a downed observation balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs&amp;rdquo; emerged, and books like Donald Keyhoe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Flying Saucers Are Real&lt;/em&gt; popularized the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Media speculation intensified, particularly during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings. The Condon Report in 1968 concluded that further UFO studies were not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into popular culture, with alien abduction accounts like the Barney and Betty Hill incident gaining prominence. Films like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, along with TV series like &lt;em&gt;In Search of&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, fueled public fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention resurfaced with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream interest. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project, aiming to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government programs like NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were established to investigate UFO claims. Congressional hearings were held in 2022 and 2023, featuring whistleblower claims from former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls indicating that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable cases and incidents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rendlesham Forest incident (1980).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; The Valensole UFO incident (1965) and the Trans-en-Provence Case (1981).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kecksburg UFO incident (1965), the Travis Walton abduction claim (1975), and the Phoenix Lights (1997).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous hoaxes include the Maury Island incident and the Gulf Breeze UFO incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UFO reports have been investigated by governments and academics in various countries. No official government investigation has definitively confirmed that UFOs are real, physical objects of extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known government studies include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ghost rockets investigation by the Swedish military (1946–1947).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Blue Book, Project Sign, and Project Grudge by the USAF (1947–1969).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948–1951).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 by the Battelle Memorial Institute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Operação Prato (1977).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France&amp;rsquo;s GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN (1977–present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s government investigation (1989–present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;americas&#34;&gt;Americas &lt;a href=&#34;#americas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil (1952–2016):&lt;/strong&gt; The National Archives of Brazil has been receiving documentation from the Brazilian Air Force regarding UFO investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chile (c. 1968):&lt;/strong&gt; The SEFAA (previously CEFAA) receives case reports from the public, civil aviators, and the Chilean Air Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada (c. 1950):&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of National Defence has investigated UFO reports, including the Falcon Lake incident and the Shag Harbour UFO incident. Early studies included Project Magnet and Project Second Storey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. investigations include Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, the CIA&amp;rsquo;s Directorate of Science &amp;amp; Technology study, the Robertson Panel, the Brookings Report, the Condon Committee, the RAND Corporation study, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Sturrock panel, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;usaaf-and-fbi-response-to-the-1947-sightings&#34;&gt;USAAF and FBI response to the 1947 sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#usaaf-and-fbi-response-to-the-1947-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;usaf&#34;&gt;USAF &lt;a href=&#34;#usaf&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;projects-sign-19471949-grudge-19481951-and-blue-book-19511970&#34;&gt;Projects Sign (1947–1949), Grudge (1948–1951), and Blue Book (1951–1970) &lt;a href=&#34;#projects-sign-19471949-grudge-19481951-and-blue-book-19511970&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s final report stated that there was not enough data to determine the origin of some UFOs. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate concluding an extraterrestrial origin, but the Air Force Chief of Staff ordered it destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classified U.S. study by the CIA in 1952 concluded that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge, which was later reorganized as Project Blue Book. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, became critical of the program&amp;rsquo;s scientific rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;usaf-regulation-200-2-19531954&#34;&gt;USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953–1954) &lt;a href=&#34;#usaf-regulation-200-2-19531954&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force Regulation 200-2 defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and outlined procedures for investigation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;blue-book-and-the-condon-committee-19681970&#34;&gt;Blue Book and the Condon Committee (1968–1970) &lt;a href=&#34;#blue-book-and-the-condon-committee-19681970&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Report in 1968 arrived at a negative conclusion regarding UFOs. Project Blue Book closed down in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;foia-release-of-documents-in-1978&#34;&gt;FOIA release of documents in 1978 &lt;a href=&#34;#foia-release-of-documents-in-1978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act in 1978 indicated serious behind-the-scenes&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;black-triangles&#34;&gt;Black Triangles &lt;a href=&#34;#black-triangles&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black triangles are a type of unidentified flying object (UFO) characterized by their triangular shape and dark color. These objects are typically observed at night and are often described as large, silent, hovering, moving slowly, and displaying pulsating, colored lights that can be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;british-sightings-and-uk-ministry-of-defence-report&#34;&gt;British Sightings and UK Ministry of Defence Report &lt;a href=&#34;#british-sightings-and-uk-ministry-of-defence-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the analysis of black triangle sightings by the UK Ministry of Defence in a declassified report called Project Condign. The report suggests that many unexplained UAP reports could be attributed to atmospheric gaseous electrically charged buoyant plasmas. It also mentions that some observations might be due to meteor entry into the atmosphere. The report proposes that a field with undetermined characteristics can exist between charged buoyant objects in loose formation, creating a triangular shape where light reflection doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur. A recommendation from the report advises aircraft to avoid intercepting these objects and instead position them astern to reduce collision risks. The report also speculates that plasma formations could induce vivid but incorrect perceptions in observers. Mark Stenhoff and Adrian James are mentioned as authors who doubt the scientific veracity of the Project Condign report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-sightings&#34;&gt;Other Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#other-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details various black triangle UFO sightings reported across different locations and time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1980s-hudson-valley-sightings&#34;&gt;1980s Hudson Valley Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#1980s-hudson-valley-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early 1980s, hundreds of people reported seeing UFOs over or near the Hudson River in New York state. These objects were described as hovering or slowly flying V-shaped objects with colorful lights. Some pilots claimed responsibility for these sightings, stating that the objects were ultralight aircraft flown in formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;19891992-belgian-wave&#34;&gt;1989–1992 Belgian Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#19891992-belgian-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian UFO wave began in November 1989. On November 29, over thirty groups of witnesses and three police groups documented a large, flat, triangular object with lights underneath flying at low altitude without making any sound. A report titled &lt;em&gt;The Belgian UFO Wave of 1989–1992 – A Neglected Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; suggests that some sightings could be explained by helicopters, with the lack of noise attributed to engine noise in witnesses&amp;rsquo; automobiles or strong winds. The Belgian Air Force attempted to intercept an object detected by radar during this wave, but the pilots did not visually confirm the object. Brian Dunning is mentioned as a skeptic who disputes the entire Belgian UFO wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1997-phoenix-lights-incident&#34;&gt;1997 Phoenix Lights Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#1997-phoenix-lights-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the widely reported &amp;ldquo;Phoenix Lights&amp;rdquo; events, where multiple unidentified objects were observed near Phoenix, Arizona, beginning on March 13, 1997. Some objects appeared in a large &amp;ldquo;V&amp;rdquo; formation and lingered for several minutes. Residents reported that one of the black triangles was over a mile wide and drifted slowly over their houses. The US Air Force concluded that the military had been testing aircraft-launched flares during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2000-southern-illinois-incident&#34;&gt;2000 Southern Illinois Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#2000-southern-illinois-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;St. Clair Triangle&amp;rdquo; sighting occurred on January 5, 2000, over several towns in Southern Illinois. The incident was featured in television shows, and Sufjan Stevens included it in his song &amp;ldquo;Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois.&amp;rdquo; The FAA suggested that the sightings might have been due to an advertising blimp operated by the American Blimp Company. William Stage is mentioned as a source, and Eric Mack is cited for debunking his own UFO sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20042006-tinley-park-lights&#34;&gt;2004–2006 Tinley Park Lights &lt;a href=&#34;#20042006-tinley-park-lights&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple witnesses in Tinley Park and Oak Forest, Illinois, reported seeing three red lights hovering in a triangular formation on several occasions between 2004 and 2006. Some witnesses captured the lights in photographs and videos. The incident was examined in a &lt;em&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/em&gt; episode and in an episode of the television series &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt;. Julie Dekker is mentioned in connection with remembering the &amp;ldquo;Tinley Park lights.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2008-stephenville-texas&#34;&gt;2008 Stephenville, Texas &lt;a href=&#34;#2008-stephenville-texas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mass sighting occurred in Stephenville, Texas, around January 8, 2008. The Netflix documentary series &lt;em&gt;Encounters&lt;/em&gt; claims that the black triangles seen had what looked like insects or a praying mantis inside. Angelia Joiner is mentioned as reporting on the possible UFO sighting in the &lt;em&gt;Stephenville Empire-Tribune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-aircraft&#34;&gt;Military Aircraft &lt;a href=&#34;#military-aircraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the possibility that classified military aircraft could be responsible for many black triangle UFO reports. Sightings have been reported over Antelope Valley in southern California, near military research and testing areas like Edwards Air Force Base and United States Air Force Plant 42. The National Institute for Discovery Science suggested that black triangles might be U.S. Air Force craft. The Northrop TR-3A Black Manta, a speculative surveillance aircraft, is mentioned, but its existence is not confirmed. Gregory T. Pope is cited regarding America&amp;rsquo;s new secret aircraft, and Global Security is referenced for information on the TR-3A. Geoscientist Ben McGee is identified as suggesting that border patrol drones with infrared lights could explain some black triangles. Natalie Wolchover is cited in relation to McGee&amp;rsquo;s explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-language-in-science-fiction&#34;&gt;Alien language in science fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-language-in-science-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the concept of alien languages as portrayed in science fiction, tracing its development from early examples to more sophisticated and detailed implementations. It highlights how the treatment of alien languages has evolved alongside the science fiction genre itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-alien-languages&#34;&gt;Understanding alien languages &lt;a href=&#34;#understanding-alien-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the challenges and approaches to understanding alien languages in science fiction. It notes the common trope of universal translators in space operas, contrasting it with hard science fiction&amp;rsquo;s focus on the difficulties of interspecies communication. The section mentions C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Out of the Silent Planet&lt;/em&gt;, where the protagonist uses historical linguistics to decipher a Martian language. Stanislaw Lem&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;His Master&amp;rsquo;s Voice&lt;/em&gt; is cited as a critical examination of humanity&amp;rsquo;s ability to understand extraterrestrial messages. D.R. Merrill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Lamikorda&lt;/em&gt; emphasizes the importance of body language and cultural context in communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also discusses franchises that have developed their own languages, such as Klingon in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; (created by Marc Okrand), the Zentradi language from &lt;em&gt;Macross&lt;/em&gt;, Kryptonese from DC Comics, Cybertronian from &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt;, and Na&amp;rsquo;vi from &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; (created by James Cameron with Paul Frommer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of language as a plot device is explored, with examples like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek TNG&lt;/em&gt; episode &amp;ldquo;Darmok,&amp;rdquo; and the film &lt;em&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt; episode &amp;ldquo;Into the Fire&amp;rdquo; illustrates how misunderstandings can arise from phonetic similarities between languages. C.J. Cherryh&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Chanur&lt;/em&gt; series and Foreigner universe are mentioned for their focus on linguistic and psychological barriers to communication. Conversely, &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; is cited for its comedic take on the improbable mutual understanding of English by humans and aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also references stories with unpronounceable alien tongues, such as Clark Ashton Smith&amp;rsquo;s tale featuring the sorcerer Eibon and the alien Hziulquoigmnzhah. Mary Doria Russell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Sparrow&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned for its complex alien language with unique tenses. Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; is cited for its multilayered encrypted messages from extraterrestrials. Ted Chiang&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Story of Your Life&amp;rdquo; (and its film adaptation, &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;) is highlighted for its detailed portrayal of alien communication through complex symbols. Sheila Finch&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Guild of Xenolinguists&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned as a collection of stories about first contact and alien communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples include the Unitology language from the game &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;, Alienese from &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;, and the R&amp;rsquo;lyehian/Cthuvian language from H.P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s Cthulhu mythos. Robert Sheckley&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Shall We Have a Little Talk?&amp;rdquo; describes a language that mutates too rapidly to be learned. China Miéville&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Embassytown&lt;/em&gt; features the Ariekei language, which requires speakers to use two words at once, spoken by genetically engineered human twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bypassing-the-issue-of-language&#34;&gt;Bypassing the issue of language &lt;a href=&#34;#bypassing-the-issue-of-language&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines how some science fiction avoids the complexities of alien languages through various devices and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;universal-translators&#34;&gt;Universal translators &lt;a href=&#34;#universal-translators&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on devices that seamlessly translate between languages, effectively eliminating language barriers. Examples include Douglas Adams&amp;rsquo;s babel fish, the TARDIS from &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, the translator microbes in &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt;, and the universal translator from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;universal-language&#34;&gt;Universal language &lt;a href=&#34;#universal-language&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the concept of a common language shared by multiple species. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; uses Basic as a universal language. Other examples include Interlac from the Legion of Super-Heroes, &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and the Uplift Universe, where multiple &amp;ldquo;Galactic&amp;rdquo; languages are used. &lt;em&gt;Stargate SG-1&lt;/em&gt; features a galactic meeting place where races communicate using a language based on atomic structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;telepathy&#34;&gt;Telepathy &lt;a href=&#34;#telepathy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the use of telepathy as a means of communication. The Vulcans in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; use the Vulcan mind meld. In &lt;em&gt;Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game&lt;/em&gt;, the Buggers communicate telepathically through their queen, highlighting the communication barriers between species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;see-also&#34;&gt;See also &lt;a href=&#34;#see-also&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>The Alien</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_73e88702e51c/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:56:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-alien&#34;&gt;The Alien &lt;a href=&#34;#the-alien&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the history of &lt;em&gt;The Alien&lt;/em&gt;, an unproduced science fiction film conceived by Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray in the late 1960s. The film was a joint venture between India and the United States, with Columbia Pictures slated to produce it. Despite the involvement of notable actors like Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando, the film was ultimately shelved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story centers around an alien spaceship that lands in a rural village in Bengal, India. The villagers, awestruck by the craft, begin to worship it. The alien, named &amp;ldquo;Mr. Ang,&amp;rdquo; communicates with a young boy named Haba through dreams and engages in playful pranks within the village. The narrative also includes an Indian businessman, a journalist from Calcutta (now Kolkata), and an American engineer. A specific scene is highlighted, describing the alien&amp;rsquo;s interaction with plant life, showcasing its gentle and curious nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbia Pictures was the producer for this planned US–India co-production, and Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando were slated to play lead roles. However, Ray discovered that his script had been copyrighted by Michael Wilson, his representative in Hollywood, who claimed co-writer credit without contributing to the writing. Marlon Brando later left the project, and although James Coburn was considered as a replacement, Ray became discouraged and returned to Calcutta. Columbia Pictures expressed interest in reviving the project in the 1970s and 1980s, but it never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the similarities between &lt;em&gt;The Alien&lt;/em&gt; and Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&lt;/em&gt;, released in 1982. Satyajit Ray pointed out the parallels between his script and Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s film, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; would not have been possible without his script being available in Hollywood. Spielberg denied these claims. The article also mentions the Hindi film &lt;em&gt;Koi&amp;hellip; Mil Gaya&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Rakesh Roshan, as another film that appears to be based on &lt;em&gt;The Alien&lt;/em&gt;, particularly in its focus on an intellectually disabled person interacting with a friendly alien. In 2003, Satyajit Ray&amp;rsquo;s son, Sandip Ray, began adapting Ray&amp;rsquo;s original 1962 story &lt;em&gt;Bankubabur Bandhu&lt;/em&gt; into a Bengali television movie of the same name, which was eventually broadcast in India in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-language&#34;&gt;Alien Language &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-language&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the hypothetical concept of alien languages, exploring the challenges and possibilities of understanding and communicating with extraterrestrial beings. It delves into the field of study dedicated to these hypothetical languages, the opinions of linguists on the matter, and examples of how the topic has been approached in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hypothetical-non-earth-language&#34;&gt;Hypothetical Non-Earth Language &lt;a href=&#34;#hypothetical-non-earth-language&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the concept of alien languages as a hypothetical subject due to the lack of confirmed contact with extraterrestrial life. It mentions the various names for the study of these languages, including exolinguistics, xenolinguistics, and astrolinguistics. The section also references the book &lt;em&gt;Xenolinguistics: Towards a Science of Extraterrestrial Language&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Douglas Vakoch and Jeffrey Punske, which features contributions from prominent linguists like Noam Chomsky. It also mentions that the topic of alien languages has been included in linguistics and language studies courses, such as at Bowling Green State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents Noam Chomsky&amp;rsquo;s view that humans might not be able to naturally learn an alien language due to the constraints of a genetically predetermined universal grammar. He suggests that understanding an alien language would require a scientific approach, similar to research in physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-1&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights Keren Rice&amp;rsquo;s more optimistic perspective, suggesting that basic communication between humans and aliens should be possible if fundamental aspects of language, such as time, space, and participants, are not radically different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-2&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-2&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Jessica Coon&amp;rsquo;s involvement as a linguistic consultant for the film &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;. While acknowledging the artistic license taken with the alien language in the film, she notes that the film accurately portrays the approach human linguists would take in attempting to decipher an alien language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-3&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-3&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions Laurance Doyle&amp;rsquo;s suggestion of using Zipf&amp;rsquo;s law to detect alien language within the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-4&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-4&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents Solomon W. Golomb&amp;rsquo;s argument that any civilization capable of interstellar communication must possess an innate understanding that information retains its meaning regardless of the speaker. He posits that this shared understanding would facilitate the learning of extraterrestrial languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-5&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-5&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section includes a quote from Ian Roberts, a professor of linguistics at the University of Cambridge, who emphasizes the unique open-endedness of human language. Roberts is also mentioned as being on the Advisory Council of Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI), an organization that sends messages into space in hopes of receiving a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;see-also&#34;&gt;See also &lt;a href=&#34;#see-also&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot summary details a series of events triggered by a mysterious signal. In 1947, a radio operator disappears while investigating a signal from Roswell, New Mexico. In the present day, the same signal reappears, originating from the South Pole. Cryptologist Julian Rome (played by James Spader) is recruited to investigate an alien object discovered in Antarctica. The object, emitting the signal, contains a deadly virus and an alien. The virus kills members of the research team and threatens a global pandemic. A nuclear strike is ordered to contain the threat. Julian communicates with the alien before it is killed, discovering the virus&amp;rsquo;s potential to destroy all life on Earth. Julian and three others are rescued by an alien spacecraft moments before the nuclear strike. The government covers up the incident, claiming a nuclear reactor meltdown. The film concludes with the alien spacecraft carrying the survivors leaving the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-nation&#34;&gt;Alien Nation &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-nation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A science fiction police procedural television series that aired on Fox from 1989 to 1990. It&amp;rsquo;s based on the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series is set in the near future, beginning in 1990, after a flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert. The ship contains the Tenctonese, a race of extraterrestrials escaping slavery. They are accepted as immigrants to the US, and the series explores their integration into American society. Storylines often address themes of racism and bigotry, using the Newcomers as a stand-in for discriminated minorities. The series uses social commentary to illustrate what it means to be human and the often bizarre rituals we observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buck Francisco:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Sean Six, George and Susan&amp;rsquo;s initially delinquent teenage son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cathy Frankel:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Terri Treas, Matt&amp;rsquo;s Newcomer neighbor and on-off girlfriend, a bio-chemist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert Einstein:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Jeff Marcus, a timid Newcomer janitor working at the police department.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sergeant Dobbs:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, a human police officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jill:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by Molly Morgan, a human girl and Emily&amp;rsquo;s friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncle Moodri:&lt;/strong&gt; Played by James Greene, an eccentric but wise Newcomer and member of the Francisco family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Johnson, responsible for other science-fiction television series, was approached for the television adaptation of the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;. He initially had no interest in the project but was later inspired to create a series focusing on social commentary about the integration of a new minority group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;changes-from-the-film&#34;&gt;Changes from the film &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-from-the-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several changes were made from the original film. The human detective Matthew Sykes was played by James Caan in the film, but Gary Graham in the TV series. Detective George Francisco was played by Mandy Patinkin in the film, but Eric Pierpoint in the TV series. The TV series explores Newcomer culture more deeply than the film. Francisco&amp;rsquo;s family also differs, with a daughter, Emily, added to the TV series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancellation&#34;&gt;Cancellation &lt;a href=&#34;#cancellation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series ran for one season on Fox. Despite building a strong fan base, the show was cancelled due to the network&amp;rsquo;s financial difficulties. The season ended on a cliffhanger, and popular demand led to the unproduced second season premiere being adapted as a novel and comic book. Years later, Fox produced five television films to continue the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episodes&#34;&gt;Episodes &lt;a href=&#34;#episodes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series consists of 22 episodes, each dealing with the integration of the Newcomers into human society and the challenges they face. The episodes often involve police procedural elements, with Sikes and Francisco investigating crimes involving both humans and Newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television-films&#34;&gt;Television films &lt;a href=&#34;#television-films&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five television films continued the story after the series&amp;rsquo; cancellation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; (1994)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt; (1995)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: The Udara Legacy&lt;/em&gt; (1997)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete series was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox in 2006. The five television films were later released as a collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revival&#34;&gt;Revival &lt;a href=&#34;#revival&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Syfy announced a new take on the series with Tim Minear writing. However, the series was later cancelled. In 2015, a remake was reported to be in the works with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing the script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cowboys--aliens-2011-film&#34;&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens (2011 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#cowboys--aliens-2011-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article provides a detailed overview of the 2011 American science fiction Western film &lt;em&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Jon Favreau. It covers various aspects of the film, including its plot, cast, production, themes, marketing, release, reception, and home media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot unfolds in 1873 New Mexico Territory, where an amnesiac outlaw named Jake Lonergan, portrayed by Daniel Craig, awakens with a mysterious metal bracelet attached to his wrist. He finds himself in the town of Absolution, which is soon attacked by aliens. The aliens abduct several townspeople, including Sheriff Taggart and Percy Dolarhyde. Lonergan&amp;rsquo;s bracelet activates, transforming into a weapon that he uses to shoot down an alien ship. A posse, including Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) and a mysterious woman named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde), forms to track the aliens. Lonergan&amp;rsquo;s memories gradually return, revealing his past abduction and the death of his lover, Alice. Ella reveals herself to be an alien from another race, who came to Earth to help resist the invaders. The group plans an attack on the aliens&amp;rsquo; mothership, resulting in a final confrontation where Ella sacrifices herself to destroy the ship and save Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film features a prominent cast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Craig&lt;/strong&gt; as Jake Lonergan, an amnesiac outlaw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harrison Ford&lt;/strong&gt; as Woodrow Dolarhyde, a powerful cattleman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivia Wilde&lt;/strong&gt; as Ella Swenson, an alien traveler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Rockwell&lt;/strong&gt; as Doc, a doctor and saloon owner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Beach&lt;/strong&gt; as Nat Colorado, Dolarhyde&amp;rsquo;s Apache right-hand man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Dano&lt;/strong&gt; as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow&amp;rsquo;s son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noah Ringer&lt;/strong&gt; as Emmett Taggart, Taggart&amp;rsquo;s grandson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Carradine&lt;/strong&gt; as Sheriff John Taggart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clancy Brown&lt;/strong&gt; as Meacham, Absolution&amp;rsquo;s preacher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production section details the film&amp;rsquo;s development, casting, writing, filming, design, and visual effects. The project began in 1997, with Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures acquiring film rights to a concept by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. Jon Favreau joined as director in 2009, and Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were cast in the lead roles. Filming took place in New Mexico and California in 2010. The film was shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film to achieve a classic movie feel. Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic (ILM) created the visual effects, with Legacy Effects producing practical puppet aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film explores themes of redemption, unity against a common enemy, and the clash between low-tech and high-tech cultures. Jon Favreau aimed for a plausible approach to how 19th-century humans could confront technologically superior extraterrestrial beings. The film also draws parallels between the alien invasion and the historical conflicts between European settlers and Native Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;marketing&#34;&gt;Marketing &lt;a href=&#34;#marketing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing section discusses the challenges of promoting a film with an &amp;ldquo;inherently comic&amp;rdquo; title and premise. The studio aimed to convey the film&amp;rsquo;s serious tone and adventure elements through trailers and presentations at events like San Diego Comic-Con.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens&lt;/em&gt; premiered at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2011 and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on July 29, 2011. Paramount Pictures released the film in IMAX theaters internationally, and Reliance Entertainment released it in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reception section covers the film&amp;rsquo;s box office performance and critical response. &lt;em&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens&lt;/em&gt; underperformed at the box office, earning $174.8 million worldwide on a $163 million budget. Critics praised the acting and special effects but criticized the screenplay and tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home Media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 6, 2011, including an extended version, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and commentary with Jon Favreau. In 2024, Kino Lorber released a 4K Blu-ray of the theatrical cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infringement-lawsuit&#34;&gt;Infringement Lawsuit &lt;a href=&#34;#infringement-lawsuit&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven John Busti filed a lawsuit against Universal, DreamWorks, Platinum Studios, and Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, claiming copyright infringement. Busti claimed he wrote a preview for his story &lt;em&gt;Cowboys and Aliens&lt;/em&gt; in 1994, which was published in the April 1995 issue of &lt;em&gt;Bizarre Fantasy #1&lt;/em&gt;. The lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-legend&#34;&gt;Historical Legend &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-legend&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capsized steamboat that appears in the film is presumed to be the &lt;em&gt;Iron Mountain&lt;/em&gt; which, according to legend, steamed out of Vicksburg towing two barges. Two hours later, another boat found the barges adrift. The ship was not found until later, having apparently been refloated by flood waters and carried through a break in a levee, and grounded in a cotton field at Omega Landing, near Tallulah, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;kecksburg-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Kecksburg UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#kecksburg-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kecksburg UFO incident occurred on December 9, 1965, in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. A fireball was seen across six U.S. states and Canada. While astronomers suggested it was a meteor bolide, the event gained notoriety in popular culture and ufology. Speculation ranged from an extraterrestrial craft to debris from the Soviet space probe Kosmos 96. It&amp;rsquo;s often referred to as &amp;ldquo;Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s Roswell.&amp;rdquo; NASA released a statement in 2005 suggesting fragments were from a Soviet satellite, but records were reportedly lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-reports&#34;&gt;Initial Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of December 9, 1965, a large fireball was observed across multiple U.S. states and Ontario, Canada, particularly over the Detroit-Windsor area. Reports included hot metal debris in Michigan and Ohio, grass fires, and sonic booms near Pittsburgh. Residents of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, reported blue smoke, vibrations, a &amp;ldquo;thump,&amp;rdquo; and a crash in the woods. Early reports in the &lt;em&gt;Greensburg Tribune-Review&lt;/em&gt; mentioned the area being sealed off by U.S. Army and State Police officials. However, a subsequent search by state troopers and Air Force personnel found nothing. Authorities dismissed explanations like a plane crash or missile test, attributing it to a meteor. Astronomer Paul Annear and geophysicist George Wetherilo supported the meteor explanation, as did astronomers William P. Bidelman and Fred Hess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-articles&#34;&gt;Scientific Articles &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-articles&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section references scientific articles written about the fireball in science journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sky--telescope&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky &amp;amp; Telescope&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#sky--telescope&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The February 1966 issue of &lt;em&gt;Sky &amp;amp; Telescope&lt;/em&gt; reported the fireball&amp;rsquo;s sighting over the Detroit-Windsor area around 4:44 p.m. EST. The FAA received 23 reports from aircraft pilots starting at the same time. A seismograph near Detroit recorded shock waves. The article concluded the fireball&amp;rsquo;s path extended from northwest to southeast, ending near western Lake Erie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;journal-of-the-royal-astronomical-society-of-canada&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#journal-of-the-royal-astronomical-society-of-canada&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1967 article in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&lt;/em&gt; (JRASC) by two astronomers used seismographic records to pinpoint the time of passage over Detroit to 4:43 p.m. Photographs taken north of Detroit were used to triangulate the object&amp;rsquo;s trajectory. The conclusion was that the fireball descended at a steep angle, moving from southwest to northeast, likely impacting the northwestern shore of Lake Erie near Windsor, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa-statements&#34;&gt;NASA Statements &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa-statements&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2005, NASA released a statement claiming experts examined metallic fragments from the area and determined they were from a Soviet satellite that re-entered the atmosphere, but records were lost in the 1980s. Leslie Kean, an investigative reporter, sued NASA under the Freedom of Information Act for the lost records. In 2007, NASA was ordered by a court to search for the records. During a hearing, NASA&amp;rsquo;s public liaison officer, Steve McConnell, testified that two boxes of relevant papers were missing. James Oberg suggested the NASA team might have been Air Force personnel posing as NASA, and that Kean&amp;rsquo;s action was a publicity stunt. John Ventre of MUFON and Owen Eichler speculated the object was a General Electric Mark 2 Re-entry Vehicle. More recent NASA comments suggest the fireball&amp;rsquo;s trajectory was inconsistent with a spacecraft re-entering from Earth orbit, more likely a meteor from the asteroid belt, and that U.S. Air Force tracking data indicated Cosmos 96 decayed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television-and-film&#34;&gt;Television and Film &lt;a href=&#34;#television-and-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the appearances of the Kecksburg UFO incident in various television shows and films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1990, &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt; aired an episode suggesting an extraterrestrial craft crashed, with locals reporting an acorn-shaped object with hieroglyphs, removed in a secret military operation. A prop from the show is displayed in Kecksburg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel aired &amp;ldquo;The New Roswell: Kecksburg Exposed,&amp;rdquo; featuring a Kecksburg resident claiming to have seen a flat-bed truck carrying something &amp;ldquo;the size of a VW.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2008, &lt;em&gt;Nazi UFO Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt; suggested the incident was the recovery of a Nazi UFO called &lt;em&gt;Die Glocke&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2009, &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; suggested a military conspiracy and cover-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011, &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt; suggested &lt;em&gt;Die Glocke&lt;/em&gt; was recovered at Kecksburg, prompting a government conspiracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2014, &lt;em&gt;In Search of Aliens&lt;/em&gt; visited the crash site with UFO researcher Stan Gordon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2019, Cody Knotts premiered his film &lt;em&gt;Kecksburg&lt;/em&gt;, dramatizing the story of a reporter claiming to be a victim of a government conspiracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Patterson cited the Kecksburg incident as partial inspiration for his 2019 film &lt;em&gt;The Vast of Night&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBC Radio 4&amp;rsquo;s 2024 drama series, &lt;em&gt;Limelight: The Skies Are Watching&lt;/em&gt;, uses the Kecksburg incident as its inspiration.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;flying-saucer&#34;&gt;Flying Saucer &lt;a href=&#34;#flying-saucer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flying saucer, or flying disc, is a purported type of disc-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO). The term originated in 1947 when US news media reported pilot Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s claim of seeing objects flying near his airplane over Washington State. The news reports included implausible speed estimates and preceded a wave of sightings across the US, including the Roswell incident and the Flight 105 UFO sighting. A National Guard pilot died in 1948 while pursuing a flying saucer. Civilian research groups and conspiracy theories developed around the topic, and the concept spread to other countries. Early reports speculated about secret military technology, but flying saucers became associated with aliens by 1950. The terms unidentified flying object (UFO) and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) have gradually replaced the term over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aerial photo taken over Lake Cote, Costa Rica, by Sergio Loaiza in 1971 is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science fiction, UFO sightings, UFO conspiracy theories, and popular culture, saucers are typically piloted by nonhuman beings. Most reported sightings describe saucers in the distance and do not mention a crew. Descriptions of the craft vary considerably. Early reports emphasized speed, but the descriptions shifted over the decades to the objects mostly hovering. They are generally said to be round, sometimes with a protrusion on top, but details of the shape vary between reports. Witnesses describe flying saucers as silent or deafening, with lights of every color, and flying alone or in formation. Size estimates range from small enough to fit in a living room to over 2,000 feet (610 m) in diameter. Sightings are most frequent at night. Astronomer Donald Howard Menzel concluded that the reports were too varied to all be describing the same type of objects. Experts have identified most reported saucers as known phenomena, including astronomical objects such as Venus, airborne objects such as balloons, and optical phenomena such as sun dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1950s pop culture embraced flying saucers. The discs appeared in film, television, literature, music, toys, and advertising. Their reports influenced religious movements and were the subject of military investigations. The shape became visual shorthand for alien invaders. During the 1960s, saucers waned in popularity as UFOs were reported and depicted in other shapes. Discs ceased to be viewed as the standard shape for alien spacecraft but are still often depicted, sometimes for their retro value to evoke the early Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of fantastical aircraft predate the first flying saucers. In antiquity, mysterious lights in the sky were interpreted as spiritual phenomena. In the 1800s, many newspapers reported massive airships with glowing lights and humming engines. These are often seen as precursors to flying saucer and UFO sightings. On January 25, 1878, the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, reported an object resembling a balloon flying &amp;ldquo;at wonderful speed&amp;rdquo;. The newspaper said it appeared to be about the size of a saucer from his perspective, one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO. An outbreak of a number of sightings of mystery airships occurred in America in 1896 and 1897. During World War II, Allied pilots reported balls of light following their planes. They named the lights foo fighters and believed they were advanced Axis aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of the typical flying saucer first appeared in science fiction. French sociologist Bertrand Méheust noted Jean de La Hire&amp;rsquo;s 1908 novel &lt;em&gt;La Roue fulgurante&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Lightning Wheel&lt;/em&gt;). In the novel, a flying disc-shaped machine abducts the protagonists via a beam of light. Science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&lt;/em&gt; began publishing &amp;ldquo;The Shaver Mystery&amp;rdquo; in 1945. Written by Richard Sharpe Shaver and edited by Raymond A. Palmer, they were science fiction tales about technologically advanced &amp;ldquo;detrimental robots&amp;rdquo; that abducted humans, but the stories were presented as a true account of Shaver&amp;rsquo;s life. Until the magazine ceased printing The Shaver Mystery, &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; letter column was regularly full of readers sharing their own purportedly true sightings of the robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the flying saucer was coined as a term, fantasy artwork in pulp magazines depicted flying discs. Skeptical physicist Milton Rothman noted the appearance of so-called flying saucers in the fantasy artwork of 1930s pulp science fiction magazines, by artists such as Frank R. Paul. One of Paul&amp;rsquo;s earliest depictions of a flying saucer appeared on the cover of the November 1929 issue of Hugo Gernsback&amp;rsquo;s pulp science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Science Wonder Stories&lt;/em&gt;. Science fiction illustrator Frank Wu wrote that the idea of space vehicles shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern flying saucer concept, including the association with aliens, can be traced to the 1947 Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. On June 24, 1947, businessman and amateur pilot Kenneth Arnold landed at the Yakima, Washington airstrip. He told staff and friends that he&amp;rsquo;d seen nine unusual airborne objects. Arnold estimated their speed at 1,700 miles per hour, beyond the capabilities of known aircraft. Newspapers soon contacted Arnold for interviews. The &lt;em&gt;East Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; reported his supposed aircraft as &amp;ldquo;saucer-like&amp;rdquo;. In a June 26 radio interview, Arnold described them as &amp;ldquo;something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear&amp;rdquo;. Headline writers coined the terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying disk&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;disc&amp;rdquo;) for the story. Arnold later told CBS News that the early coverage &amp;ldquo;did not quote me properly [&amp;hellip;] when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water. Most of the newspapers misunderstood and misquoted that, too. They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion.&amp;rdquo; The circular shape of typical flying saucers may be due to reporters mistaking Arnold&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;saucer-like&amp;rdquo; description of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold&amp;rsquo;s story preceded a wave of hundreds of flying saucer reports. Lieutenant Governor of Idaho Donald S. Whitehead claimed he saw a fast-moving object resembling a meteor around the time of Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. In early July, head of Air Materiel Command Nathan F. Twining told reporters that &amp;ldquo;anyone seeing the objects&amp;rdquo; should contact Wright Field. The next widely publicized report was the sighting by a United Airlines crew on July 4 of nine more disc-like objects pacing their plane over Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public was divided on the potential origin of the saucers. Arnold told military intelligence officers he suspected the discs were experimental aircraft, and early newspapers reported Arnold saying, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they were—unless they were guided missiles.&amp;rdquo; News media speculated on a Soviet origin, and many war veterans connected them to the foo fighters seen during World War II. A Gallup Poll found that 90% of Americans were aware of the saucer stories, and 16 percent believed they were secret military weapons, most likely American. The most common explanation given was some type of illusion or mirage. Less than one percent believed they were alien craft. One report from Seattle, Washington, described a hammer and sickle painted onto a flying disc. The stories spread to other countries, where they were influenced by local political and social concerns. In Europe, which was still recovering from the Second World War, saucers were often reported with rocket-like features. German newspapers reported flying saucers that exploded or had tails of fire. The names for the discs were largely derived from the English &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; including the French &lt;em&gt;soucoupe volante&lt;/em&gt;, Spanish &lt;em&gt;platillo volante&lt;/em&gt;, Portuguese &lt;em&gt;disco voador&lt;/em&gt;, Swedish &lt;em&gt;flygande tefat&lt;/em&gt;, German &lt;em&gt;fliegende Untertasse&lt;/em&gt;, and Italian &lt;em&gt;disco volante&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1947 sightings peaked in the days after the Fourth of July and declined rapidly through mid-July. Multiple organizations offered $1,000 rewards for hard proof. In the widely reported July 7, 1947, Twin Falls saucer hoax, four teenagers in Idaho fabricated a crashed disc from jukebox parts. On July 8, the Army Air Force base at Roswell, New Mexico, issued a press release saying that they had recovered a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; from a nearby ranch; the so-called Roswell UFO incident made front-page news. International media covered the military&amp;rsquo;s announcement of a crashed disc, but within 24 hours were reporting the military&amp;rsquo;s retraction and explanation that the material was balloon debris. By July 11, the most widely reported story was a North Hollywood resident&amp;rsquo;s claim that a 30-inch galvanized iron disc containing glass radio tubes had crashed in his garden. Newspapers quoted Fire Battalion Chief Wallace Newcombe&amp;rsquo;s assessment, &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look to me like it could fly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Air Force collected over a hundred reports at Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Air Force General Nathan Twining established Project SAUCER, later renamed Project Sign, the first in a series of UFO investigations by the US Government. Other national governments followed suit. Canada began Project Magnet and the United Kingdom launched the Flying Saucer Working Party in 1950, which attributed saucer reports to meteorological phenomena, astronomical phenomena, misidentification, optical illusions, misconceptions, or hoaxes&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;mariana-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Mariana UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#mariana-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mariana UFO incident occurred in August 1950 in Great Falls, Montana. It involves a sighting filmed by local baseball coach Nick Mariana, considered among the first motion picture footage of a UFO. The U.S. Air Force initially claimed the objects were reflections of two F-94 jet fighters, a claim they later retracted and then endorsed again. Multiple investigations have yielded inconclusive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 15, 1950, at 11:29 am, Nick Mariana and his secretary, Virginia Raunig, spotted two bright, silvery objects rotating while flying over Great Falls at an estimated speed of 200 to 400 miles per hour. Mariana filmed the objects for sixteen seconds using his 16 mm movie camera. The &lt;em&gt;Great Falls Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reported the sighting the next day, and Mariana showed the film to local groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-investigation&#34;&gt;Air Force Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;em&gt;Great Falls Tribune&lt;/em&gt; informed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base about the sighting, Captain John P. Brynildsen interviewed Mariana and Raunig at Malmstrom AFB. Brynildsen sent the film to Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis. The Air Force initially determined the objects were reflections from two F-94 jet fighters. However, controversy arose when Mariana claimed the first thirty-five frames of his film, which clearly showed the UFOs as rotating disks, were missing. The Air Force denied removing more than a single damaged frame. Edward J. Ruppelt, who later headed Project Blue Book, noted the initial lack of Air Force interest in the UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lawsuit&#34;&gt;Lawsuit &lt;a href=&#34;#lawsuit&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1951, Bob Considine, a writer and UFO skeptic, wrote an article for &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/em&gt; debunking famous UFO sightings, including Mariana&amp;rsquo;s. Mariana filed a slander lawsuit against Considine, which was eventually dropped in September 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-studies&#34;&gt;Later Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#later-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 1952, Ruppelt convinced Mariana to allow the Air Force to reanalyze the film. Analysts at Wright-Patterson AFB ruled out birds, balloons, meteors, and reflections from F-94 jets. Ruppelt concluded the film showed an unknown object. In January 1953, the Robertson Panel, convened by the Air Force and CIA, judged the objects to be reflections of aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;baker-analysis&#34;&gt;Baker Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#baker-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1954, Greene-Rouse Productions hired Robert M.L. Baker, Jr. of Douglas Aircraft to analyze Mariana&amp;rsquo;s film for a documentary. Baker concluded that the jet reflection explanation was strained. In 1968, Baker testified before a Congressional hearing on UFOs, stating that his analysis excluded most natural phenomena. In 1969, at an AAAS UFO panel, Baker presented a paper concluding the Mariana film was unidentifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condon-report&#34;&gt;Condon Report &lt;a href=&#34;#condon-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, the U.S. government funded a study of the UFO phenomenon at the University of Colorado, chaired by Edward U. Condon. Roy Craig, a skeptical physicist, and David Saunders, a psychologist interested in the Mariana incident, reinvestigated the film. They disagreed on the film&amp;rsquo;s authenticity and the removal of frames. William Hartmann, an astronomer, analyzed the film and suggested airplanes remained the principal working hypothesis, though he acknowledged arguments against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of Mariana&amp;rsquo;s film are in the US National Archives. The film is featured in documentaries and online, and continues to be debated. Great Falls, Montana, has had over 100 UFO sightings since Mariana&amp;rsquo;s incident. In 2008, the minor league baseball team in Great Falls was renamed the Great Falls Voyagers in honor of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;time-traveler-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Time-traveler UFO hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#time-traveler-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time-traveler hypothesis, also known as chrononaut UFO, future humans, extratempestrial model, and Terminator theory, proposes that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are humans traveling from the future using advanced technology. This concept has gained recent attention from figures like retired NASA aerospace engineer Larry Lemke, Wisconsin congressman Mike Gallagher, and filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Mainstream scholars consider this hypothesis extremely implausible, and it&amp;rsquo;s generally viewed as unorthodox even among fringe conspiracy theorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;antecedents&#34;&gt;Antecedents &lt;a href=&#34;#antecedents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the origins of the ideas that led to the time-traveler UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins-of-time-travel-speculation&#34;&gt;Origins of time travel speculation &lt;a href=&#34;#origins-of-time-travel-speculation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection traces the concept of time travel from the future to the past back to its literary origins. Pierre Boitard&amp;rsquo;s 1861 book &lt;em&gt;Paris avant les hommes&lt;/em&gt; is credited with introducing the idea, featuring a man sent back to prehistoric Earth. Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s 1887 novel &lt;em&gt;Lumen&lt;/em&gt; also explored the theme of a soul traveling through different historical periods. The section also notes that while time travel is considered physically impossible by most, theoretical research continues to explore its potential feasibility, with scientists like J. Richard Gott and Ronald Mallet speculating on the possibility of future human time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;speculation-of-future-human-evolution&#34;&gt;Speculation of future human evolution &lt;a href=&#34;#speculation-of-future-human-evolution&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the history of speculation about the future evolution of mankind. It highlights H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt; as an early example of both time travel and speculative evolution. Other authors mentioned include Edgar Rice Burroughs, Olaf Stapledon, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Baxter, and Cevdet Mehmet Kösemen. The section also identifies climate change, the technological singularity, space travel, and genetic enhancement as potential factors that could alter human evolution, leading to transhuman and posthuman scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufos-and-initial-explanations&#34;&gt;UFOs and initial explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#ufos-and-initial-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection provides a brief overview of the history of UFO sightings. It mentions reports of unknown objects in the skies dating back to antiquity, as well as the mystery airship sightings of the 1890s and the Foo fighters and ghost rockets during World War II. The modern UFO era is said to have begun in the summer of 1947, following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. Initial explanations for these sightings ranged from novel US or Soviet technology to misidentification of mundane objects and mass hysteria. Fringe theories included extraterrestrial or interdimensional origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;formation-and-spread&#34;&gt;Formation and spread &lt;a href=&#34;#formation-and-spread&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the development and popularization of the time-traveler UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implausibility-of-humanoid-aliens&#34;&gt;Implausibility of humanoid aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#implausibility-of-humanoid-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection addresses the common depiction of aliens as humanoids in contactee and alien abduction folklore. It cites George Gaylord Simpson&amp;rsquo;s 1964 article &lt;em&gt;The Nonprevalence of Humanoids&lt;/em&gt;, which argues that it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely for extraterrestrial intelligence to exist and even more unlikely for it to be humanoid. The section also mentions Stephen Jay Gould&amp;rsquo;s thought experiment about rewinding evolution, suggesting that humans would likely not evolve again. Biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s view on the implausibility of Grey aliens evolving a physiology similar to humans is also included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-popularization&#34;&gt;Modern popularization &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-popularization&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the modern resurgence of the time-traveler hypothesis. It mentions Jacques Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1975 book &lt;em&gt;The Invisible College&lt;/em&gt; as an early example. Other figures and works mentioned include David S. Anderson, Jenny Randles, James Herbert Brennan, and Philip J. Corso and William J. Birnes&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, which reported Hermann Oberth&amp;rsquo;s belief that the Roswell craft could have been a time machine. The History channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt; is also mentioned for its episodes exploring the concept. Michael P. Masters&amp;rsquo; book &lt;em&gt;Identified Flying Objects&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Extratempestrial Model&lt;/em&gt; are highlighted for their in-depth exploration of the hypothesis. Tim Peake and Steven Spielberg are mentioned for their recent public comments on the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection lists examples of the time-traveler hypothesis in popular culture. It includes the TV series &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s About Time&lt;/em&gt;, Gregory Benford&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Timescape&lt;/em&gt;, David Drake&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Sphere&lt;/em&gt;, the TV film &lt;em&gt;Official Denial&lt;/em&gt;, the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Blake and Mortimer&lt;/em&gt;, the band Yes, Jordan Peele&amp;rsquo;s movie &lt;em&gt;Nope&lt;/em&gt;, and the movie &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terminology-and-connection-to-other-theories&#34;&gt;Terminology and connection to other theories &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology-and-connection-to-other-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection clarifies the terminology used to describe the hypothesis, noting that while Michael P. Masters uses the term &amp;ldquo;extratempestrial,&amp;rdquo; the overall idea is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;the time-traveler hypothesis.&amp;rdquo; It also discusses the overlap between the time-traveler hypothesis and the interdimensional hypothesis, with figures like John Ventre and Harold E. Puthoff using the terms interchangeably. The section also notes that the time-traveler hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for the absence of future time travelers, similar to how the extraterrestrial hypothesis addresses Fermi&amp;rsquo;s paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism &lt;a href=&#34;#criticism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents criticisms of the time-traveler hypothesis. It notes that the hypothesis is considered pseudoscientific. Neil deGrasse Tyson is quoted as calling the hypothesis illogical, and Robert Sheaffer criticizes Michael P. Masters&amp;rsquo; work for relying on the belief that time travel is possible. David J. Darling argues that the extraterrestrial and time-travel hypotheses are equally unlikely and unnecessary. Ian Ridpath suggests that Jim Penniston&amp;rsquo;s claims about time-traveling UFOs may have been influenced by the film &lt;em&gt;Official Denial&lt;/em&gt;. Isaac Arthur is mentioned for debunking the concept as presented in &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. Fabio Costa is quoted as saying that time travel requires two doors, one in the future and one in the past, raising the question of where the time machine is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;westall-ufo&#34;&gt;Westall UFO &lt;a href=&#34;#westall-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Westall UFO incident refers to a reported UFO sighting that occurred on April 6, 1966, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The event involved multiple witnesses, including students and a teacher from Westall High School. The incident has been commemorated through documentaries, reunions, and a UFO-themed playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reports&#34;&gt;Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 6, 1966, students and a teacher at Westall High School (now Westall Secondary College) reported observing a round, white, grey, or silver object with a domed top. The object reportedly descended behind trees into the Grange, an open area south of the school. Some accounts mention the object being pursued by five unidentified aircraft. Shaun Matthews, who was on vacation at the Grange, described the object as having a slight purple hue and being about twice the size of a family car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witness accounts varied, with some reporting the object taking off after landing, while others claimed it hovered. Students who went to the Grange after the sighting described a landing site with varying details, including a circle of grass described as burnt, &amp;ldquo;boiled,&amp;rdquo; or pressed down. The number of circles reported ranged from one to three. On April 9, 1966, air force personnel and UFO enthusiasts visited the field but found nothing of interest. The landowner subsequently burned the field to prevent further access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; newspaper initially suggested the object might have been a weather balloon released from Laverton. However, checks revealed that no commercial, private, or RAAF pilots reported anything unusual in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Basterfield proposed that a runaway balloon from the HIBAL high-altitude balloon project, used to monitor radiation levels after British nuclear tests at Maralinga, could be a likely explanation. He cited documents indicating a test balloon launched from Mildura may have drifted off course and landed near Westall High School. Basterfield noted that HIBAL balloons had a white silver appearance with a parachute and gas tube, consistent with witness descriptions. Reports also surfaced of &amp;ldquo;men in suits&amp;rdquo; cautioning witnesses against discussing the incident, suggesting a secret government exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Dunning suggested that a weather balloon could explain the initial sighting. He proposed that a nylon target drogue, towed by one plane for others to chase, could account for the second part of the event. Dunning also noted that over time, descriptions of the event have become mixed with fabricated details, making it difficult to discern accurate accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media-coverage&#34;&gt;Media Coverage &lt;a href=&#34;#media-coverage&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary &lt;em&gt;Westall &amp;lsquo;66&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the sighting, featuring interviews conducted by ufologist Shane Ryan. &lt;em&gt;Westall &amp;lsquo;66&lt;/em&gt; has been incorporated into the national history curriculum as a lesson on critical analysis of popular portrayals of historical events. &lt;em&gt;The Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary film directed and co-produced by ufologist James Fox, includes content related to the Westall UFO case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;local-culture&#34;&gt;Local Culture &lt;a href=&#34;#local-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A witness reunion was held at Westall Tennis Club Hall on April 8, 2006, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the incident. The City of Kingston created Grange Reserve UFO Park at The Grange Reserve in Clayton South, featuring a silver UFO with red slides to reflect the 1966 Westall UFO Incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;chicago-ohare-ufo-sighting&#34;&gt;Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare UFO Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#chicago-ohare-ufo-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This details a supposed paranormal event that occurred on November 7, 2006, around 4:15 p.m. at O&amp;rsquo;Hare International Airport. Twelve United Airlines employees and other witnesses reported seeing a UFO. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) dismissed the incident as a &amp;ldquo;weather phenomenon&amp;rdquo; due to the object not being detected on radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sighting&#34;&gt;The Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#the-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7, 2006, at approximately 4:15 PM CST, a group of twelve airport employees at Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare International Airport reported witnessing a metallic, saucer-shaped craft hovering over Gate C-17. A ramp employee first spotted the object while pushing back United Airlines Flight 446, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina. The employee alerted the flight crew. Pilots, airline management, and mechanics also witnessed the object. Air traffic controllers did not see the object, and it did not appear on radar. Witnesses described the object as silent, dark gray, and ranging from 6 to 24 feet in diameter. Independent witnesses outside the airport also reported seeing the object. One witness described a disc-shaped craft hovering over the airport that shot through the clouds at high velocity, leaving a clear blue hole. Eyewitness accounts varied regarding the shape, height, movement, time, and number of objects sighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reaction-from-the-federal-aviation-administration-and-united-airlines&#34;&gt;Reaction from the Federal Aviation Administration and United Airlines &lt;a href=&#34;#reaction-from-the-federal-aviation-administration-and-united-airlines&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, both United Airlines and the FAA denied having information about the sighting. The &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, prompting the FAA to conduct an internal review of air-traffic communications tapes. The review uncovered a call from a United supervisor to an FAA manager in the airport tower regarding the UFO sighting. The FAA concluded that the sighting was due to a &amp;ldquo;weather phenomenon&amp;rdquo; and would not investigate further. Astronomer Mark Hammergren suggested that weather conditions were conducive to a &amp;ldquo;hole-punch cloud.&amp;rdquo; UFO investigators argued that the FAA&amp;rsquo;s refusal to investigate contradicted its mandate to investigate potential security breaches at airports. Some witnesses expressed frustration that federal officials declined to investigate the matter further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media-coverage&#34;&gt;Media Coverage &lt;a href=&#34;#media-coverage&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare airport UFO story received coverage from major media outlets, including CNN, CBS, MSNBC, Fox News, the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, and NPR. The History Channel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; reviewed the incident in an episode titled &amp;ldquo;Aliens at the Airport&amp;rdquo; on February 11, 2009. The incident is also featured in &lt;em&gt;Hangar 1: The UFO Files&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as spacecraft or probes from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature back to the mid-1960s. Key figures mentioned include French ufologist Jacques Vallée, who used the term in his 1966 book, and French engineer Aimé Michel. James E. McDonald and James Harder also used the term in 1968 during a symposium and congressional testimony. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; in the Condon Report (1969). Skeptic Philip J.

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as spacecraft or probes from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature. It notes that the term gained traction in the latter half of the 1960s, with early usage attributed to French ufologist Jacques Vallée in his 1966 book. Other figures who used the term in the late 1960s include Aimé Michel, James E. McDonald, and James Harder. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; in 1969 when presenting the findings of the Condon Report. Skeptic Philip J.

The section mentions a secret West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, which also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. It also discusses the CIA&amp;rsquo;s internal scientific review of UFOs in the early 1950s, noting that some CIA scientists were seriously considering the ETH. The section mentions extraterrestrial &amp;ldquo;believers&amp;rdquo; within Project Blue Book, including Major Dewey Fournet and consultant J. Allen Hynek, who later became a staunch supporter of the ETH. It also cites statements from former CIA Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, who urged Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects. The section mentions Greek physicist Paul Santorini&amp;rsquo;s claim that a 1947 Greek government investigation into the European Ghost rockets concluded that they were extraterrestrial. It also discusses the 1968 Condon Report, noting that many members of the study disagreed with Condon&amp;rsquo;s methods and biases. The section mentions the 1999 private French COMETA report, which concluded that the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors best accounted for the facts. It also discusses Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of the official French UFO investigation SEPRA, who stated that 14% of the cases studied by SEPRA were &amp;lsquo;utterly inexplicable and extraterrestrial&amp;rsquo; in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34;&gt;Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It notes that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien encounters. It states that despite ardent believers, no rigorous analysis has ever concluded that various UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34;&gt;U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery &lt;a href=&#34;#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the alleged Trinity UFO case, a story about a crashed unidentified object near the Trinity test site in New Mexico in August 1945. The narrative centers around claims made by José Padilla and Remigio Baca, who, as young boys, reported witnessing the crash and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fourth-day&#34;&gt;Fourth day &lt;a href=&#34;#fourth-day&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection describes a visit to the Padilla family by Sergeant R. Avila, who requested permission to access the property to recover an &amp;ldquo;experimental weather balloon.&amp;rdquo; Avila emphasized the need for secrecy and the use of heavy equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ariel School UFO incident</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1994-sighting-in-zimbabwe&#34;&gt;1994 Sighting in Zimbabwe &lt;a href=&#34;#1994-sighting-in-zimbabwe&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 16, 1994, a UFO sighting occurred outside Ruwa, Zimbabwe, witnessed by 62 pupils aged six to twelve at Ariel School. The children reported seeing silver crafts descend from the sky and land in a nearby field. Some claimed to have encountered creatures dressed in black who communicated a telepathic message with an environmental theme, causing fear and distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortean writer Jerome Clark called it the &amp;ldquo;most remarkable close encounter of the third kind of the 1990s.&amp;rdquo; Skeptics have suggested mass hysteria as a possible explanation. Some children maintain the truthfulness of their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruwa is described as a small agricultural center 22 kilometers southeast of Harare. Ariel School was a private school, primarily attended by children from wealthy white families in Harare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days before the Ariel School incident, numerous UFO sightings were reported throughout southern Africa, including reports of a bright fireball in the sky at night. This led to a wave of UFO mania in Zimbabwe. Brian Dunning suggests the fireball was the re-entry of the Zenit-2 rocket from the Cosmos 2290 satellite launch. Local UFO researcher Cynthia Hind recorded other alien sightings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sightings at Ariel School occurred at 10 a.m. on September 16, 1994, during mid-morning break. The faculty was in a meeting at the time. The incident lasted about fifteen minutes. The children reported the event to their teachers, but were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After telling their parents, many parents came to the school the next day to discuss the incident with the faculty. The sighting was reported on ZBC Radio, where Cynthia Hind learned about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBC correspondent Tim Leach visited the school on September 19 to film interviews with pupils and staff. Hind visited the school on September 20, interviewing children and asking them to draw what they had seen. She reported that the children told her the same story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Harvard University professor of psychiatry John Mack visited the school to interview witnesses. Mack had investigated UFO sightings and the alien abduction phenomenon throughout the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to interviews by Hind, Leach, and Mack, 62 children reported seeing at least one UFO. Silver objects, usually described as discs, appeared in the sky and descended to a field near the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between one and four creatures with big eyes and dressed in black exited a craft and approached the children. Some children ran, but others stayed and watched. Mack&amp;rsquo;s interviews suggest the creatures telepathically communicated an environmental message to the children before returning to the craft and flying away. Dunning notes that the telepathic message aspect was primarily in Mack&amp;rsquo;s reports, although Hind reported it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children described being warned about impending events and the importance of avoiding pollution. One child said they were told the world would end because of a lack of care for the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children insisted they had not seen a plane. Hind noted that the children&amp;rsquo;s different cultural backgrounds led to varying interpretations, with some believing they had seen tikoloshes from Shona and Ndebele folklore rather than extraterrestrials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ariel School UFO incident became a famous UFO case in Africa. A June 2021 episode of the BBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Witness History&lt;/em&gt; described it as &amp;ldquo;one of the most significant events in UFO history.&amp;rdquo; Ufologists continue to cite the case as evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth. Skeptics have suggested mass hysteria or a prank as explanations. Gideon Reid proposed a hypothesis involving confusion with touring puppet shows promoting AIDS awareness. Another argument suggests the children misidentified a dust devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hind interviewed the children in groups, potentially leading to cross-contamination of their stories. Dunning says that Mack, interviewed the children two months after the alleged sighting and as a known environmentalist, &amp;ldquo;prompted and suggested&amp;rdquo; the telepathic communication angle, which was not present in Hind&amp;rsquo;s previous report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several witnesses maintain the truthfulness of their accounts. In 2014, a witness told the &lt;em&gt;Mail &amp;amp; Guardian&lt;/em&gt; that she fears the creatures will return and that she can sense when they are back in the atmosphere. In 2016, witness Emily Trim exhibited paintings described as a &amp;ldquo;manifestation of the messages she received&amp;rdquo; from the beings. In June 2021, Barstool Sports writer Zah, a former Ariel School pupil, recounted seeing a bright light and aliens exiting it. Other witnesses were interviewed for the 2020 documentary &lt;em&gt;The Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Netflix documentary &amp;ldquo;Encounters&amp;rdquo;, a former student named Dallyn claimed that he was behind this incident. He claimed that he purposefully told his classmates and other students that a &amp;ldquo;shiny rock&amp;rdquo; in the distance was a UFO. According to his own statement in the documentary, he never thought this would work, and was surprised about the mass hysteria. Dallyn&amp;rsquo;s claims in the documentary directly contradict claims made on camera 15 years prior to the documentary, describing the UFO as having a light that would &amp;ldquo;flash a different color in the sky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2006 British comedy film directed by Jonny Campbell and written by William Davies, &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; is a fictionalized account of the events surrounding the infamous &amp;ldquo;alien autopsy&amp;rdquo; film promoted by Ray Santilli.

&lt;p&gt;Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield recount their story to a documentary maker. In 1995, they travel to the United States to find Elvis memorabilia. They encounter Harvey, a former US Army cameraman, who offers them a film from 1947 depicting the autopsy of an alien from the Roswell UFO crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning to England, Ray and Gary discover the film has degraded. To avoid repercussions from their investor, Laszlo Voros, they decide to recreate the autopsy film. They use a mannequin and meat products to create a replica alien and film it in Gary&amp;rsquo;s sister&amp;rsquo;s living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sell the film, earning a large sum of money. Voros demands a larger share of the profits but is killed in a mysterious accident. Ray and Gary travel to Argentina to promote the film, where they are followed by reporter Amber Fuentes. They produce a fake interview with a homeless man posing as Harvey to maintain Harvey&amp;rsquo;s anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray and Gary attempt to restore the original 1947 footage, but after viewing the results, they decide to bury the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanda Saknussemm, a social misfit from Los Angeles, learns of her archaeologist father&amp;rsquo;s death in North Africa. While sorting through his belongings, she discovers notes about Atlantis, an alien ship that crashed and sank into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s center. Wanda accidentally falls into a deep hole and awakens in the underground world of Atlantis. She encounters Gus, a miner, who helps her search for her father, whom she believes is still alive. The Atlanteans consider surface dwellers &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; and suspect Wanda and her father of planning an invasion. Wanda becomes a fugitive, pursued by &amp;ldquo;Government House&amp;rdquo; and the crime lord Mambino. She receives assistance from Charmin&amp;rsquo;, a rogue who falls in love with her. Eventually, Wanda is captured by General Rykov, who intends to kill her and her father. Gus helps them escape, and they return to the surface. The film concludes with Wanda rejecting her ex-boyfriend and reuniting with Charmin&amp;rsquo; on a beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Pyun took on &lt;em&gt;Alien from L.A.&lt;/em&gt; after being approached by producers Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan during the troubled production of &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Center of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;. Pyun agreed to finish the film if he could also film &lt;em&gt;Alien from L.A.&lt;/em&gt; for under $1 million. Kathy Ireland was cast by Pyun after seeing a photo of her. Filming locations included Los Angeles, Redondo Beach, South Africa, and Namibia. The gold mines and dumps around South Africa were used for the underground setpieces. The sets were inspired by &amp;ldquo;future noir&amp;rdquo; films like &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Bob Briggs called it a &amp;ldquo;pretty decent film&amp;rdquo;, awarding it two stars. Rebecca Harris of the &lt;em&gt;Abilene Reporter-News&lt;/em&gt; gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4. David Picking called it &amp;ldquo;a cheapo adventure movie without a single redeeming quality&amp;rdquo;. Rob Thomas of &lt;em&gt;The Capital Times&lt;/em&gt; said &amp;ldquo;Completely awful – you can&amp;rsquo;t believe they&amp;rsquo;re serious.&amp;rdquo; Daniel M. Kimmel of the &lt;em&gt;Worcester Telegram &amp;amp; Gazette&lt;/em&gt; gave the film one out of five stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a description of the 1978 science fiction horror film &lt;em&gt;The Alien Factor&lt;/em&gt;, directed, written, and produced by Don Dohler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot centers around a spaceship crash in a sparsely populated area of Earth. Three grotesque aliens survive the crash and begin terrorizing the local residents. A character named Ben Zachary steps forward to fight back against the extraterrestrial threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main cast includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don Leifert as Ben Zachary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Griffith as Sheriff Cinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Dyszel as Mayor Wicker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mary Mertens as Edie Martin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Geiwitz as Pete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Stover as Steven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleanor Herman as Mary Jane Carter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anne Frith as Dr. Ruth Sherman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Schlechter and John Cosentino played the aliens Inferbyce and Zagatile, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alien Factor&lt;/em&gt; marked Don Dohler&amp;rsquo;s directorial debut after he was laid off from his job as a payroll manager. The initial script was a comedy with 15 monsters, but it was changed to a straight horror film with only three monsters. Larry Schlechter and John Cosentino built the creature suits for the Inferbyce and Zagtile, respectively. Ernest D. Farino created the Leemoid through stop motion animation. Filming took place in and around Baltimore, Maryland, from October 1976 to April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was released on DVD by Retromedia Entertainment on February 26, 2002. Image Entertainment released it on November 15, 2005, as part of the Don Dohler Collection. Mill Creek Entertainment released it on July 19, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film received generally negative reviews. &lt;em&gt;TV Guide&lt;/em&gt; gave it two out of five stars, calling it &amp;ldquo;silly.&amp;rdquo; Dave Sindelar criticized the acting and direction. &lt;em&gt;Critical Outcast&lt;/em&gt; acknowledged the film&amp;rsquo;s flaws but admired Dohler&amp;rsquo;s initiative. &lt;em&gt;VideoHound&amp;rsquo;s Golden Movie Retriever&lt;/em&gt; awarded it one and a half out of four bones, noting the decent special effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sequels&#34;&gt;Sequels &lt;a href=&#34;#sequels&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alien Factor 2: Alien Rampage&lt;/em&gt; was not a direct sequel. Fred Olen Ray, the Retromedia distributor, used the sequel-sounding title for marketing purposes. The original title was &lt;em&gt;Alien Rampage&lt;/em&gt;, filmed in 1999 as Don Dohler&amp;rsquo;s comeback movie after an 11-year hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34;&gt;Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI) &lt;a href=&#34;#communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CETI is a branch of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) that focuses on composing and deciphering interstellar messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. A well-known CETI experiment is the 1974 Arecibo message composed by Frank Drake. The abbreviations CETI and SETI are generic and do not refer to any particular organization like the SETI Institute. CETI research focuses on mathematical languages, pictorial systems (like the Arecibo message), algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; language communication. Research also addresses how to overcome problems of decipherment in interplanetary communication, similar to the challenges posed by undeciphered writing systems in human communication like Linear A. In 2015, scientists including Douglas Vakoch, David Grinspoon, Seth Shostak, and David Brin discussed active SETI and the potential risks of transmitting messages to extraterrestrials. A statement signed by many in the SETI community emphasized the need for a global discussion before sending any messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, speculation about inhabitants of other planets was common, with many believing intelligent beings lived on the Moon, Mars, and/or Venus. Before radio, proposals for signaling extraterrestrials included Carl Friedrich Gauss&amp;rsquo;s 1820 suggestion to draw a giant Pythagorean triangle on the Siberian tundra and Joseph Johann Littrow&amp;rsquo;s 1819 idea to use the Sahara as a &amp;ldquo;blackboard&amp;rdquo; with trenches filled with water and kerosene to create signals. Astronomers like Franz von Paula Gruithuisen also looked for signs of life, claiming to see cities and agriculture on the Moon and evidence of life on Venus. By the late 1800s, Mars became the focus after Giovanni Schiaparelli reported &amp;ldquo;canali&amp;rdquo; (channels) on Mars, which were mistranslated as &amp;ldquo;canals,&amp;rdquo; sparking enthusiasm about Martian life. Inventor Charles Cros sought funding for a giant mirror to signal Martians, while Nikola Tesla believed his inventions could be used for interplanetary communication and claimed to have observed extraterrestrial radio signals. The Guzman Prize was created, offering 100,000 francs to the first person to establish interplanetary communication, excluding Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mathematical-and-scientific-languages&#34;&gt;Mathematical and Scientific Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#mathematical-and-scientific-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers artificial languages designed for interstellar communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lincos-lingua-cosmica&#34;&gt;Lincos (Lingua cosmica) &lt;a href=&#34;#lincos-lingua-cosmica&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans Freudenthal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse&lt;/em&gt; (1960) expands upon Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols. A dictionary resembling Lincos was featured in Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; and its film adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;astraglossa&#34;&gt;Astraglossa &lt;a href=&#34;#astraglossa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancelot Hogben&amp;rsquo;s 1963 essay &amp;ldquo;Astraglossa&amp;rdquo; describes a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses, where short pulses represent numbers and trains of long pulses represent symbols for addition, subtraction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;carl-sagan&#34;&gt;Carl Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#carl-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores how a message might be constructed for communication with an alien civilization, using prime numbers as a starting point, followed by universal principles and facts of mathematics and science. Sagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject, and an updated collection of articles was published in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34;&gt;A Language Based on the Fundamental Facts of Science &lt;a href=&#34;#a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle&amp;rsquo;s 1992 paper, &lt;em&gt;A language based on the fundamental facts of science&lt;/em&gt;, describes a language similar in syntax to Astraglossa and Lincos, but which builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34;&gt;Busch General-Purpose Binary Language Used in Lone Signal Transmissions &lt;a href=&#34;#busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language later used in the Lone Signal project to transmit crowdsourced messages to extraterrestrial intelligence (METI). This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the Lone Signal hailing message. The Lone Signal project sent messages to Gliese 526 (HD 119850) in the constellation Boötes, with the message sent on July 10, 2013, and expected to arrive in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pictorial-messages&#34;&gt;Pictorial Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#pictorial-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictorial communication systems describe fundamental mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as bitmaps. These messages assume the recipient has similar visual capabilities and can understand basic mathematics and geometry. A critique is that they presume a shared understanding of shapes, which may not be the case with a species with substantially different vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pioneer-probes&#34;&gt;Pioneer Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#pioneer-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two etched plaques, known as the Pioneer plaques, were included aboard the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft when they launched in 1972 and 1973. The plaques depict the location of the Solar System within the galaxy and the Earth within the Solar System, as well as the form of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;voyager-probes&#34;&gt;Voyager Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#voyager-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977, the Voyager probes carried two golden records that were inscribed with diagrams similar to the Pioneer plaques, depicting the human form, the Solar System, and its location. Also included were recordings of images and sounds from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arecibo-message&#34;&gt;Arecibo Message &lt;a href=&#34;#arecibo-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arecibo message, transmitted in 1974, was a 1,679-pixel bitmap that, when properly arranged into 73 rows and 23 columns, shows the numbers one through ten; the atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus; the formulas for the sugars and bases that make up the nucleotides of DNA; the number of nucleotides in the human genome; the double helix structure of DNA; a simple illustration of a human being and its height; the human population of Earth; a diagram of the Solar System; and an illustration of the Arecibo telescope with its diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmic-call-messages&#34;&gt;Cosmic Call Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-call-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt; messages consisted of digital sections – &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo;, a copy of the Arecibo Message, the Bilingual Image Glossary, and the Braastad message – as well as text, audio, video, and other image files submitted for transmission by people around the world. The &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo; was composed by Stéphane Dumas and Yvan Dutil, and represents a multi-page bitmap that builds a vocabulary of symbols representing numbers and mathematical operations. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from Evpatoria Planetary Radar in Russia under the scientific guidance of Alexander L. Zaitsev. Richard Braastad coordinated the overall project. Star systems to which the messages were sent include 16 Cyg A, 15 Sge, HD 178428, Gl 777, Hip 4872, HD 245409, 55 Cnc, HD 10307, and 47 UMa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;multi-modal-messages&#34;&gt;Multi-Modal Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#multi-modal-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teen-age-message&#34;&gt;Teen-Age Message &lt;a href=&#34;#teen-age-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Teen-Age Message&lt;/em&gt;, composed by Russian scientists (Zaitsev, Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the 70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center in Ukraine to six star systems resembling that of the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consists of three parts: a coherent-sounding radio signal with slow Doppler wavelength tuning, analog information representing musical melodies performed on the theremin, and Arecibo-like binary digital information. Star systems to which the message was sent are HD 197076, 47 UMa, 37 Gem, HD 126053, HD 76151, and HD 193664.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34;&gt;Cosmic Call 2 (Cosmic Call 2003) Message &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cosmic Call-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program &lt;em&gt;Ella&lt;/em&gt;, and the Braastad message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;algorithmic-messages&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#algorithmic-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic communication systems describe a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a virtual machine. Advantages include localized communication, forward error correction, and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmicos&#34;&gt;CosmicOS &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmicos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CosmicOS&lt;/em&gt;, designed by Paul Fitzpatrick at MIT, describes a virtual machine that is derived from lambda calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;logic-gate-matrices&#34;&gt;Logic Gate Matrices &lt;a href=&#34;#logic-gate-matrices&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic Gate Matrices&lt;/em&gt; (LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal virtual machine that is constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;natural-language-messages&#34;&gt;Natural Language Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-language-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research focuses on receiving a signal or message that is either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or one that is in its natural communicative form. Methods are being developed to detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content. This structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language, and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;astraglossa&#34;&gt;Astraglossa &lt;a href=&#34;#astraglossa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancelot Hogben&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Astraglossa&amp;rdquo; (1963) describes a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses, where short pulses represent numbers and long pulses represent symbols for mathematical operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;carl-sagan&#34;&gt;Carl Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#carl-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores how a message might be constructed for communication with an alien civilization, using prime numbers, mathematics, and science. Sagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34;&gt;A Language Based on the Fundamental Facts of Science &lt;a href=&#34;#a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle&amp;rsquo;s 1992 paper describes a language similar to Astraglossa and Lincos, but builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34;&gt;Busch General-Purpose Binary Language Used in Lone Signal Transmissions &lt;a href=&#34;#busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language used in the Lone Signal project to transmit crowdsourced messages to extraterrestrial intelligence. The Lone Signal project transmitted messages to Gliese 526 in the constellation Boötes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pictorial-messages&#34;&gt;Pictorial Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#pictorial-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictorial communication systems describe mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as bitmaps. These messages assume the recipient has similar visual capabilities and understands basic mathematics and geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pioneer-probes&#34;&gt;Pioneer Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#pioneer-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pioneer plaques were included aboard the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft, depicting the location of the Solar System within the galaxy, the Earth within the Solar System, and the human form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;voyager-probes&#34;&gt;Voyager Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#voyager-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977, the Voyager probes carried golden records inscribed with diagrams similar to the Pioneer plaques, depicting the human form, the Solar System, and its location, along with recordings of images and sounds from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arecibo-message&#34;&gt;Arecibo Message &lt;a href=&#34;#arecibo-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arecibo message, transmitted in 1974, was a 1,679-pixel bitmap showing the numbers one through ten, atomic numbers of key elements, formulas for DNA nucleotides, the number of nucleotides in the human genome, the DNA double helix, a human figure and height, the human population, a diagram of the Solar System, and an illustration of the Arecibo telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmic-call-messages&#34;&gt;Cosmic Call Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-call-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt; messages consisted of digital sections, including a &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo; composed by Stéphane Dumas and Yvan Dutil, a copy of the Arecibo Message, the Bilingual Image Glossary, and the Braastad message, as well as text, audio, video, and other image files. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from Evpatoria Planetary Radar in Russia under the scientific guidance of Alexander L. Zaitsev. Star systems targeted included 16 Cyg A, 15 Sge, HD 178428, Gl 777, Hip 4872, HD 245409, 55 Cnc, HD 10307, and 47 UMa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;multi-modal-messages&#34;&gt;Multi-Modal Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#multi-modal-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses messages that combine different forms of communication, such as sound, images, and text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teen-age-message&#34;&gt;Teen-Age Message &lt;a href=&#34;#teen-age-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Teen-Age Message&lt;/em&gt;, composed by Russian scientists (Zaitsev, Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the 70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center in Ukraine to six star systems resembling the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consisted of a coherent-sounding radio signal, musical melodies performed on the theremin, and Arecibo-like binary digital information. Star systems targeted included 197076, 47 UMa, 37 Gem, 126053, 76151, and 193664.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34;&gt;Cosmic Call 2 (Cosmic Call 2003) Message &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-call-2-cosmic-call-2003-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt;-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program &lt;em&gt;Ella&lt;/em&gt;, and the Braastad message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;algorithmic-messages&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#algorithmic-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic communication systems describe a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosmicos&#34;&gt;CosmicOS &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmicos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CosmicOS&lt;/em&gt;, designed by Paul Fitzpatrick at MIT, describes a virtual machine derived from lambda calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;logic-gate-matrices&#34;&gt;Logic Gate Matrices &lt;a href=&#34;#logic-gate-matrices&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic Gate Matrices&lt;/em&gt; (LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal virtual machine constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;natural-language-messages&#34;&gt;Natural Language Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-language-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research focuses on detecting and deciphering signals or messages that are either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or are in their natural communicative form. Methods are being developed to detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content. This structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language, and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected. John Elliott is a key researcher in this area. A key concept is that human languages conform to a Zipfian distribution, which may also apply to alien languages. Laurance Doyle explains that the slope of a line that represents individual tokens in a stream of tokens may indicate whether the stream contains linguistic or other structured content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ceti-researchers&#34;&gt;CETI Researchers &lt;a href=&#34;#ceti-researchers&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists key individuals involved in CETI research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Drake (SETI Institute):&lt;/strong&gt; SETI pioneer, composed the Arecibo message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr John Elliott:&lt;/strong&gt; Researches strategies for deciphering &amp;rsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; language messages, focusing on algorithms to detect intelligent-like structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurence Doyle (SETI Institute):&lt;/strong&gt; Studies animal communication and develops statistical measures of complexity in animal utterances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephane Dumas:&lt;/strong&gt; Developed &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt; messages and techniques for generating noise-resistant 2-D symbols.&lt;/li&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 14:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_345d7fc33b75/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-ufo-related-hoaxes&#34;&gt;List of UFO-related Hoaxes &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-ufo-related-hoaxes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article provides a compilation of various hoaxes related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs). It categorizes these hoaxes into different types, including airship hoaxes, crashed UFO hoaxes, sighting hoaxes, and photographic hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;airship-hoaxes&#34;&gt;Airship Hoaxes &lt;a href=&#34;#airship-hoaxes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details several instances of airship hoaxes, primarily from the late 19th century. Key events include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day 1897, Omaha, Nebraska:&lt;/strong&gt; Two practical jokers launched a helium balloon with a burning wicker basket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 17, 1897, Dallas, Texas:&lt;/strong&gt; Three boys created a &amp;ldquo;mystery airship&amp;rdquo; sighting using a kerosene-soaked cotton ball attached to a turkey vulture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 19, 1897, Leroy, Kansas:&lt;/strong&gt; Alexander Hamilton reported an airship lassoing a heifer, which was later published in the &lt;em&gt;Yates Center Farmer’s Advocate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1909 Airship Sighting Wave:&lt;/strong&gt; Wallace Tillinghast claimed to have built and flown an airship extensively over the Northeastern United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crashed-ufo-hoaxes&#34;&gt;Crashed UFO Hoaxes &lt;a href=&#34;#crashed-ufo-hoaxes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on hoaxes involving purported crashed UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1884, Dundy County, Nebraska:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Nebraska State Journal&lt;/em&gt; published two hoax articles about a crashed UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-autopsy&#34;&gt;Alien Autopsy &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the Ray Santilli &amp;ldquo;Alien Autopsy&amp;rdquo; film hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1993:&lt;/strong&gt; Ray Santilli presented film footage allegedly showing an autopsy of an alien from the Roswell UFO incident in 1947.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1995:&lt;/strong&gt; The American Fox Broadcasting Company broadcast the footage in &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The footage was later revealed to be a hoax involving latex dummies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Santilli claimed he bought the film from Jack Barnett, who falsely claimed to be a commander in the US army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1967-flying-saucer-hoax-in-england&#34;&gt;1967 Flying Saucer Hoax in England &lt;a href=&#34;#1967-flying-saucer-hoax-in-england&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a hoax involving the placement of six &amp;lsquo;flying saucers&amp;rsquo; in southern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1967:&lt;/strong&gt; Apprentices from the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough placed six &amp;lsquo;flying saucers&amp;rsquo; between the Thames Estuary and the Bristol Channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hoax was part of Rag Week and intended to raise money for charity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;british-roswell&#34;&gt;British Roswell &lt;a href=&#34;#british-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses a &amp;ldquo;miniature UFO&amp;rdquo; discovered in Sipho Moor near Scarborough, North Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1957:&lt;/strong&gt; A small piece of metal with hieroglyphs was found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experts deemed it most likely a hoax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sighting-hoaxes&#34;&gt;Sighting Hoaxes &lt;a href=&#34;#sighting-hoaxes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists sighting hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maury Island Incident (1947)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morristown UFO Hoax (2009)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;photographic-hoaxes&#34;&gt;Photographic Hoaxes &lt;a href=&#34;#photographic-hoaxes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on photographic hoaxes related to UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;photograph-of-an-alien-taken-at-ilkley-moor-1987&#34;&gt;Photograph of &amp;ldquo;an alien&amp;rdquo; taken at Ilkley Moor (1987) &lt;a href=&#34;#photograph-of-an-alien-taken-at-ilkley-moor-1987&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details a photograph alleged to be of an alien taken in West Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 1, 1987:&lt;/strong&gt; A photograph taken on Ilkley Moor was claimed to depict an alien.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; claimed to expose it as a hoax in 1989, identifying the &amp;ldquo;alien&amp;rdquo; as an insurance broker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belgian investigators questioned how experienced investigators could have been misled by such a hoax.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-implants&#34;&gt;Alien Implants &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-implants&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien implants are physical objects that some people believe are placed in their bodies after being abducted by aliens. These implants are purported to have various capabilities, including telepresence, mind control, and biotelemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of alien implants can be traced back to a 1957 radio show interview with ufologist John Robinson, who recounted a neighbor&amp;rsquo;s claim of being kidnapped by aliens and controlled by &amp;ldquo;small earphones.&amp;rdquo; Betty Andreasson claimed aliens implanted a device in her nose in 1967. Dorothy Wallis made a similar claim in 1983. Authors like Whitley Strieber popularized the idea of alien abductions and associated implants. John E. Mack examined an object given to him by a client who claimed it came out of her nose after an abduction. Roger Leir claimed to have removed alien implants from patients. Skeptic Joe Nickell suggests that supposed alien implants are ordinary materials that become lodged in the body and surrounded by scar tissue. Virgil Priscu stated that there is &amp;ldquo;No mystery, no implants&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien implants, depicted as small needles inserted into victims, first appeared in the 1953 film &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
