&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs,&amp;rdquo; stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass the diverse range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has seen increased usage in the 21st century, partly to avoid the negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; In popular culture, &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; often implies an alien spacecraft, while the term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish this explanation from earthbound ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies indicate that most UFOs, upon thorough investigation, are identifiable as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft (military, civilian, experimental, drones), astronomical objects (bright stars, planets, meteors), balloons (weather, research, toy), hoaxes, light phenomena (mirages, flares, searchlights), other atmospheric objects (birds, unusual clouds, plasma), and psychological effects (pareidolia, hallucinations). Allan Hendry&amp;rsquo;s 1979 study found that fewer than 1% of investigated cases were hoaxes, with most sightings being misidentifications due to inexperience or misperception. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that increased investigation often reveals less mystery than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet, for example, was recorded by Chinese astronomers as early as 240 BC. Such events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes objects moving through the sky in ancient Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt; (1088), which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts from 1561 and 1566 depicting celestial phenomena over Nuremberg and Basel, respectively, which some connect to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An 1878 &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; article reporting John Martin&amp;rsquo;s sighting of a large, dark, circular object, one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous reports of &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; in United States newspapers from 1896 to 1897.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings ranged from St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire to German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, dubbed &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected, primarily by the Swedish military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s widely reported sighting in 1947, where he described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; near Mount Rainier. This event sparked a media frenzy and numerous subsequent sightings. Weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred, involving the recovery of a downed observation balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs&amp;rdquo; emerged, and influential books by Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, and Gerald Heard promoted the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis. Media speculation intensified, particularly during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force initiated investigations into UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings between 1952 and 1969. Public pressure for declassification of UFO records mounted, but the CIA resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into American popular culture, with the Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gaining notoriety. In 1966, a Gallup poll revealed that 5% of Americans claimed to have seen a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo; Despite efforts to debunk UFO claims, public fascination persisted, fueled by sci-fi films and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention surged following &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; report on the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos further heightened interest. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government-sponsored programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Harris Poll in 2009 indicated that 32% of Americans believed in UFOs. A 2021 Pew research poll found that 51% in the United States thought that UFOs reported by people in the military were likely to be evidence of intelligent life from beyond the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable cases and incidents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rendlesham Forest incident (1980).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; The Valensole UFO incident (1965) and the Trans-en-Provence Case (1981).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kecksburg UFO incident (1965), the Travis Walton abduction claim (1975), and the Phoenix Lights (1997).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous hoaxes include the Maury Island incident and the George Adamski claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigations-of-reports&#34;&gt;Investigations of reports &lt;a href=&#34;#investigations-of-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO reports have been investigated by governments and academics in various countries. No official government investigation has definitively confirmed that UFOs are real, physical objects of extraterrestrial origin or a threat to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known government studies include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Swedish military&amp;rsquo;s ghost rockets investigation (1946–1947).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USAF&amp;rsquo;s Project Blue Book (1947–1969).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Army/Air Force Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948–1951).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Operação Prato (Operation Saucer) (1977).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France&amp;rsquo;s GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN investigation (1977–present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s government investigation (1989–present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;americas&#34;&gt;Americas &lt;a href=&#34;#americas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brazil-19522016&#34;&gt;Brazil (1952–2016) &lt;a href=&#34;#brazil-19522016&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Archives of Brazil holds documentation from the Brazilian Air Force regarding UFO investigations between 1952 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;chile-c-1968&#34;&gt;Chile (c. 1968) &lt;a href=&#34;#chile-c-1968&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEFAA (previously CEFAA), a department of the DGAC, receives reports of UFO sightings from the public, civil aviators, and the Chilean Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;canada-c-1950&#34;&gt;Canada (c. 1950) &lt;a href=&#34;#canada-c-1950&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of National Defence has investigated UFO reports across Canada, including the Falcon Lake incident and the Shag Harbour UFO incident. Early Canadian studies included Project Magnet (1950–1954) and Project Second Storey (1952–1954).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;united-states&#34;&gt;United States &lt;a href=&#34;#united-states&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigations into UFOs include Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, the CIA&amp;rsquo;s DS&amp;amp;T study, the Robertson Panel, the Brookings Report, the Condon Committee, the RAND Corporation study, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Sturrock panel, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953–1954) defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and mandated its investigation as a potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Committee&amp;rsquo;s negative conclusion in 1968 led to the closure of Project Blue Book in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, the White House released an official response stating that the U.S. government has no evidence of&lt;/p&gt;

While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;

Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. Studies have shown that misidentification of prosaic phenomena, often due to inexperience or misperception, is a primary factor in UFO sightings.

&lt;li&gt;A report in the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in 1878, where a farmer described seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings. The Condon Report in 1968 concluded that further UFO studies were not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into popular culture, with alien abduction accounts like the Barney and Betty Hill incident gaining prominence. Films like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, along with TV series like &lt;em&gt;In Search of&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, fueled public fascination.&lt;/p&gt;

Congressional hearings were held in 2022 and 2023, featuring whistleblower claims from former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls indicating that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Operação Prato (1977).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France&amp;rsquo;s GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN (1977–present).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s final report stated that there was not enough data to determine the origin of some UFOs. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate concluding an extraterrestrial origin, but the Air Force Chief of Staff ordered it destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classified U.S. study by the CIA in 1952 concluded that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge, which was later reorganized as Project Blue Book. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, became critical of the program&amp;rsquo;s scientific rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;usaf-regulation-200-2-19531954&#34;&gt;USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953–1954) &lt;a href=&#34;#usaf-regulation-200-2-19531954&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force Regulation 200-2 defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and outlined procedures for investigation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;blue-book-and-the-condon-committee-19681970&#34;&gt;Blue Book and the Condon Committee (1968–1970) &lt;a href=&#34;#blue-book-and-the-condon-committee-19681970&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Report in 1968 arrived at a negative conclusion regarding UFOs. Project Blue Book closed down in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-ufo-sightings-in-the-czech-republic&#34;&gt;List of UFO Sightings in the Czech Republic &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-ufo-sightings-in-the-czech-republic&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article documents alleged UFO sightings in the Czech Republic, spanning from 1976 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1976-radkov&#34;&gt;1976, Radkov &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-radkov&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, a family in Radkov witnessed a triangular, boomerang-shaped UFO while at a campfire. Two years later, a similar object was reportedly pursued by a military aircraft from Žatec over Western Bohemia, without success. In 1992, similar objects were observed in Cheb, near Prague, and near Dvůr Králové.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1987-vranov&#34;&gt;1987, Vranov &lt;a href=&#34;#1987-vranov&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vranov UFO incident, considered the most famous in the Czech Republic, occurred on July 12, 1987, in Vranov nad Dyjí above the Vranov Reservoir. A helicopter regiment was ordered to pursue a black, cigar-shaped object first located near the Austrian border. Pilots were instructed to shoot it down, but the object&amp;rsquo;s erratic movements and the presence of vacationers below prevented them. First Lieutenant Jaroslav Špaček reported the object flew towards their helicopter, forcing them to dodge it. The object then moved at high speed over Brno, Jaslovské Bohunice, and Bratislava before disappearing from radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1991-miličín&#34;&gt;1991, Miličín &lt;a href=&#34;#1991-mili%c4%8d%c3%adn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 12, 1991, a glowing round object was sighted near Miličín, causing panic among the local population. The sphere appeared randomly and silently followed people. Some witnesses reported seeing figures within the sphere, who allegedly left the sphere to &amp;ldquo;repair&amp;rdquo; something on a cottage roof, leaving behind large, four-fingered footprints. A local pastor reportedly told people it was a divine miracle and to remain silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1992-tři-sekery&#34;&gt;1992, Tři Sekery &lt;a href=&#34;#1992-t%c5%99i-sekery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 1992, military radars detected an object approaching the Czechoslovak border from Germany, crossing near Tři Sekery and heading towards Hvozd. Fighter jets and helicopters were dispatched, but despite radar visibility and ground observers, pilots could not locate the object. The object reportedly headed towards Chomutov and disappeared near Jirkov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1993-borová&#34;&gt;1993, Borová &lt;a href=&#34;#1993-borov%c3%a1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 21, 1993, a man in Borová encountered a flatfish-shaped object hovering above the road. The object then moved and floated noiselessly. The following day, numerous UFO sightings of various shapes and sizes were reported across the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2009&#34;&gt;2009 &lt;a href=&#34;#2009&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During late May 2009, multiple reports of flying objects emerged from various locations in the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 23, 2009, four people near Klínovec saw four orange lights flying at equal intervals. Similar objects were seen later that night above Chrást near Plzeň.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 24, 2009, people in Říčany observed three glowing spheres in the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 25, 2009, a university professor, who wished to remain anonymous, reported seeing disc-shaped objects resembling car high beams above the Brno highway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
