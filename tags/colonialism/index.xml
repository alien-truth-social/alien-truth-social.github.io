      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-contact-anthropology&#34;&gt;First Contact (Anthropology) &lt;a href=&#34;#first-contact-anthropology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact, in anthropology, refers to the initial meeting between two communities that were previously unaware of each other. This phenomenon is often associated with significant cultural and societal impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consequences&#34;&gt;Consequences &lt;a href=&#34;#consequences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cultures with vastly different technological advancements meet, the more technologically advanced society often has a disruptive advantage. This can lead to dire consequences for the less advanced society. Disease transmission also plays a critical role, as isolated populations often lack immunity to illnesses carried by the more urbanized society. The relative sizes of the populations involved can also influence intercultural development. Outcomes of first contact can range from social integration and colonization to elimination (genocide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before contemporary instances of contact with uncontacted peoples, many communities and states were isolated from each other, possessing limited knowledge of one another. The limited formal contact between Europe and China via the Silk Road and later with the Mongol Empire is one such example. European powers, such as Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, sought to reach Greater India, leading to the mistaken identification of the Americas as the West Indies and the indigenous peoples of the Americas as &amp;ldquo;Indians.&amp;rdquo; This &amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; has been criticized as one-sided and has parallels in contemporary narratives of first contact beyond Earth, such as the Pioneer plaque. Colonialism often used first contact as a means to control knowledge and representation of &amp;ldquo;the other,&amp;rdquo; objectifying contact and its place on the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-examples&#34;&gt;Notable Examples &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-examples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous instances of first contact have occurred throughout history, including Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s invasions from Persia to India in 330 BC and the establishment of Romano-Chinese relations in the 2nd century AD. However, well-established trade routes meant that many cultures were aware of each other before they met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specific examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~1000:&lt;/strong&gt; Vikings, led by Leif Erikson, established a settlement at L&amp;rsquo;Anse Aux Meadows (present-day Canada) and encountered the Beothuk people (referred to as Skr√¶ling). The nature of this contact (peaceful or violent) is debated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 October 1492:&lt;/strong&gt; Christopher Columbus&amp;rsquo;s first voyage led to contact between the Spanish Empire and the Ta√≠no, Galibi, and Ciboney peoples in the West Indies. This contact was violent and resulted in numerous deaths, enslavement, and subjugation of the indigenous inhabitants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 June 1579:&lt;/strong&gt; Francis Drake&amp;rsquo;s circumnavigation brought the English into contact with the Coast Miwok in Northern California. Relations remained peaceful during Drake&amp;rsquo;s month-long stay, during which he claimed the land for England as Nova Albion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 July 1595:&lt;/strong&gt; √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira led a Spanish expedition to the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), resulting in initial friendly contact with the Polynesians that quickly turned violent, leading to 200 local deaths in the first two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 December 1642:&lt;/strong&gt; Abel Tasman&amp;rsquo;s first voyage led to contact between the Dutch and the NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri in New Zealand. The encounter resulted in the death of four Dutch and the wounding of one MƒÅori, with no further communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 January 1788:&lt;/strong&gt; James Cook&amp;rsquo;s third voyage brought the British into contact with the Native Hawaiians on Kauai, Hawaii. General friendly trade occurred, but one Indigenous Hawaiian was killed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 January 1788:&lt;/strong&gt; The First Fleet&amp;rsquo;s arrival in Sydney, Australia, led to contact between the British Empire and the Cadigal and Bidjigal peoples. The initial contact was friendly but reserved, with one aborigine likely beaten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 November 1791:&lt;/strong&gt; William R. Broughton led a British expedition to Chatham Island, New Zealand, resulting in contact with the Moriori people. Initial shows of aggression by the Moriori were followed by peaceful relations, but a fight led to the death of one Moriori.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1930:&lt;/strong&gt; Mick Leahy led an Australian expedition to the New Guinea Highlands, resulting in contact with the Papuan people. The contact was friendly, with some Highland people believing the Australians were their ancestors and attempting to rub off their white skins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Culture of extraterrestriality</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;culture-of-extraterrestriality&#34;&gt;Culture of Extraterrestriality &lt;a href=&#34;#culture-of-extraterrestriality&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture of extraterrestriality encompasses the cultural imagination and depiction of otherworldliness, alienness, or outer space. It characterizes &amp;ldquo;the other&amp;rdquo; through extraterrestrial space, going beyond mere extraterritoriality or periphery. It involves the space imagined or described as extraterrestrial, or any space outside a described land, creating conditions of spatially set apart otherness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestriality has been a feature of many past and contemporary cultures. Politically, it has been an element of utopianism and colonialism, particularly in the formation of colonies as products in extraterrestrial space. These histories inform contemporary cultures of extraterrestriality, influencing space exploration, the reception of its findings, space colonization, and the search for extraterrestrial life. Colonialism was associated with extraterrestrial space as early as the 17th century when John Wilkins suggested that future adventurers like Francis Drake and Christopher Columbus might reach the Moon and people to live there.&lt;/p&gt;
