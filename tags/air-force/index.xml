      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-big-sur-ufo&#34;&gt;The Big Sur UFO &lt;a href=&#34;#the-big-sur-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details a reported UFO incident that allegedly occurred during a 1964 Air Force mission near Big Sur, California. The Air Force team was stationed on a mountaintop to film Atlas missile tests from Vandenberg Air Force Base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-deployment-to-anderson-peak&#34;&gt;Air Force deployment to Anderson Peak &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-deployment-to-anderson-peak&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From August to November 1964, the U.S. Air Force deployed personnel to the Los Padres National Forest in California. They used a special telescope borrowed from Boston University to photograph missile launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Lt. Robert Jacobs was the commander for the Big Sur location, managed by the 1369th Photo Squadron. The team successfully filmed nine launches, including one of an Atlas missile called &amp;ldquo;Buzzing Bee,&amp;rdquo; capturing footage of a re-entry vehicle deploying decoy warheads. This technology was highly classified and designed to protect American nuclear weapons from Soviet interception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1982, Robert Jacobs wrote about the incident in the tabloid &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, claiming he had been part of a cover-up and was now breaking his silence. He described film footage of an unidentified object next to a warhead and a senior official&amp;rsquo;s reaction. Jacobs claimed he was instructed to never discuss the film. Major Florenz Mansmann reportedly confirmed Jacobs&amp;rsquo; account in a 1987 letter. Robert Hastings, a UFO author, further popularized the story in 2007. In 2021, Jacobs participated in a press conference to discuss his interpretation of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kingston A. George, the project engineer during the incident, disputed Jacob&amp;rsquo;s claims of extraterrestrial interference in the &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;. George stated that he, too, had seen footage he wasn&amp;rsquo;t cleared to see and was instructed not to speak of it. However, George claims he knew the true purpose of the test: filming the deployment of decoy warheads and chaff to confuse enemy air defenses. He attributed the lights Jacobs reported to the explosive deployment of decoys and chaff, not a UFO energy beam.&lt;/p&gt;
