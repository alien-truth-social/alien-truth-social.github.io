&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no conclusive scientific detection has occurred, the possibilities range from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and advanced civilizations. The field dedicated to its study is astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides background information on the conditions necessary for life in the universe. It starts with the Big Bang and the subsequent cooling of the universe, highlighting the initial lack of elements necessary for life. The formation of carbon and oxygen through stellar fusion is mentioned, as well as the emergence of planetary systems and organic compounds. Abiogenesis and panspermia are presented as potential origins of life. The section also discusses the vastness of the universe, the limitations of current space exploration technology, and the concept of the circumstellar habitable zone (Goldilocks zone). It concludes by noting the potential for past extraterrestrial life and the adaptive capabilities of life on Earth, while emphasizing that habitability does not guarantee the existence of life. Avi Loeb is mentioned for his speculation on the &amp;ldquo;Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the debate on whether extraterrestrial life is common or rare. It presents the argument for ubiquitous life based on the size and age of the universe, the abundance of life&amp;rsquo;s chemical elements, and the universality of physical laws, citing Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking. The Copernican and mediocrity principles are also mentioned. The Rare Earth hypothesis, which posits that a unique combination of factors makes Earth habitable, is presented as a counterargument. The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The section concludes by discussing the Fermi paradox, which highlights the contradiction between the high probability estimates of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for their existence. Dennis W. Sciama, Zhi-Wei Wang, and Samuel L. Braunstein are mentioned in relation to the Fermi paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the potential biochemical characteristics of extraterrestrial life. It considers a range of lifeforms from microorganisms to intelligent beings. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, stars, volcanoes, plate tectonics, and hydrothermal vents are presented as potential energy sources. Water is highlighted as a crucial solvent, though alternatives like ammonia and hydrocarbons are mentioned. The section explores the chemical elements that could compose extraterrestrial life, focusing on carbon and its potential replacements like silicon. The advantages and disadvantages of silicon-based life are discussed. Norman Horowitz is mentioned for his views on carbon-based life. The section also considers the potential for radically different biochemistries, the role of natural selection, and the likelihood of cell membranes. The evolution from simple cells to multicellular organisms is discussed, with Simon Conway Morris&amp;rsquo;s views on convergent evolution mentioned. Scientists from the University of Oxford are mentioned for their study suggesting aliens may be similar to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34;&gt;Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life &lt;a href=&#34;#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the origins of life on Earth and how it may be related to the possibility of extraterrestrial life. It highlights that the conditions on other planets seem too extreme to harbor life, but some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in extreme environments. Fossil evidence and historical theories have marked environments like hydrothermal vents or acidic hot springs as some of the first places that life could have originated on Earth. The aspects of these harsh environments that make them ideal for the origin of life on Earth, as well as the possibility of creation of life on other planets, is the chemical reactions forming spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines the potential for life on other bodies within our solar system. Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most likely candidates. Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that may have once been similar to Earth. The possibility of microbial life in Venus&amp;rsquo;s high-altitude clouds is mentioned. Mars is described as a cold, airless desert, but with evidence of past abundant water. The potential for ancient fossilized remains and surviving microbes underground is noted. The gas giants and ice giants are deemed unlikely to contain life, but the possibility of life on moons orbiting these planets is explored. Europa&amp;rsquo;s subsurface ocean is highlighted, as well as Ganymede and Callisto. Enceladus&amp;rsquo;s eruption columns are mentioned as a potential source of study. Titan is presented as the only celestial body besides Earth with liquid bodies on the surface, with speculations about lifeforms with different biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
