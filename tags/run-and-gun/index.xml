It initially launched as a Flash game on Newgrounds in 2002, created by Tom Fulp and Dan Paladin. It was later re-released in expanded versions for various consoles and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

Matthew E. Harwood composed the music. The original Flash version was released in 2002. Console versions were released in 2004 and 2005 for PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. A Game Boy Advance port, developed by Tuna Technologies, came out in 2006. A high-definition version, &lt;em&gt;Alien Hominid HD&lt;/em&gt;, was released for Xbox 360 in 2007. A remaster, also titled &lt;em&gt;Alien Hominid HD&lt;/em&gt;, was released in 2023 for Windows, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S, alongside a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Alien Hominid Invasion&lt;/em&gt;. A PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 version is planned.&lt;/p&gt;

Gameplay involves instant death upon being hit and supports two-player simultaneous play. Players control the Alien Hominid, who defends against waves of secret agents using a blaster, melee attacks, and grenades. Advanced moves include rolling, biting off heads, digging underground, and collecting power-ups for extra grenades, shields, and unique ammo. Players can also drive vehicles, ride a Yeti, and pilot a UFO. Completing tasks unlocks hats for the Hominid. The main game has sixteen stages. Additional modes include Challenge, Neutron Ball, Pinata Boss, a PDA game with 200 levels and a level editor, &lt;em&gt;All You Can Eat&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Super Soviet Missile Mastar&lt;/em&gt; minigame.&lt;/p&gt;

The FBI steals the ship, leading the alien to pursue them with the help of &amp;ldquo;fat kids.&amp;rdquo; After retrieving the ship, the alien crashes into Russia due to a Soviet missile. The alien recovers the ship again but is captured by an Area 51 spaceship. The alien escapes, befriends a sentient eyeball, and defeats a buff alien. The &amp;ldquo;fat kids&amp;rdquo; help the alien and eyeball escape in the ship, using a tractor beam to lift the kids out of an Area 51 truck.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;Super Soviet Missile Mastar&lt;/em&gt; minigame was released as a free iOS app in 2011, and an improved version of the &lt;em&gt;PDA Games&lt;/em&gt; minigame was released for iOS in 2011. Tom Fulp cited the &lt;em&gt;PDA Games&lt;/em&gt; as inspiration for &lt;em&gt;BattleBlock Theater&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
