      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from another world rather than Earth. While no extraterrestrial life has been conclusively detected, it could range from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The science dedicated to studying extraterrestrial life is astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides a framework for understanding life in the universe, including planetary habitability within and outside the Solar System. It notes that the early universe was initially too hot for life and lacked the necessary elements. Carbon and oxygen were later created through stellar fusion. The section also discusses the possibility of life spreading between habitable planets via panspermia. It emphasizes that the raw components of life are ubiquitous in the cosmos due to stellar evolution. The vast distances between celestial objects pose a challenge to the study of extraterrestrial life, and current technology limits exploration to telescopes and probes. Dark matter, while abundant, is not considered relevant to astrobiology. The concept of the circumstellar habitable zone, or &amp;ldquo;Goldilocks zone,&amp;rdquo; is introduced, but it&amp;rsquo;s noted that habitability is complex and depends on various factors. The section concludes by highlighting the potential for extraterrestrial life to have emerged and evolved at different times in the universe&amp;rsquo;s history, and that life may be equally fleeting on a cosmic scale. Avi Loeb is mentioned for his speculation about primitive life appearing during the &amp;ldquo;Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the debate on whether life in the cosmos is common or rare. The argument for ubiquitous extraterrestrial life rests on the size and age of the universe, the ubiquity of life&amp;rsquo;s chemical elements, and the universality of physical laws. Scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view, which is embodied in the Copernican and mediocrity principles. The Rare Earth hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that life on Earth is possible due to a series of unlikely factors, making extraterrestrial life rare. The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is presented as a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation&amp;rsquo;s variables and Drake&amp;rsquo;s proposed estimates are provided. The section notes the controversy surrounding the Drake equation due to the speculative nature of its values. It also mentions the vast number of galaxies and planetary systems in the observable universe. The Fermi paradox, the contradiction between high probability estimates and the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations, is introduced. Dennis W. Sciama, Zhi-Wei Wang, and Samuel L. Braunstein are mentioned in relation to the Fermi paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the potential biochemical basis of extraterrestrial life. It notes that extraterrestrial life could range from simple microorganisms to complex alien intelligences. The basic requirements for life include an environment with non-equilibrium thermodynamics and a source of energy, such as stars, volcanoes, or hydrothermal vents. Water is considered essential as a solvent for biochemical reactions, but alternatives like ammonia or liquid hydrocarbons are also mentioned. The section explores the chemical elements that could compose extraterrestrial life, focusing on carbon and its potential replacements, such as silicon. The advantages and disadvantages of silicon-based life are discussed. Norman Horowitz is mentioned for his view on the versatility of carbon. The section also considers the possibility of radically different biochemistries, even if based on carbon and water. It discusses the requirements for natural selection and the potential for extraterrestrial life to evolve differently from life on Earth. Simon Conway Morris is mentioned for his view on convergent evolution leading to similar lifeforms. Scientists from the University of Oxford are mentioned for their study suggesting aliens may be similar to humans. The section concludes by discussing the influence of planetary context on life and the capacity for developing intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34;&gt;Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life &lt;a href=&#34;#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section addresses the common perception that the harsh conditions on other planets make them unlikely to harbor life. It presents evidence that some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs. These environments are characterized by intense UV radiation, extreme temperatures, and a lack of water. The section highlights the chemosynthetic processes occurring around hydrothermal vents, which allow organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon. It suggests that similar processes could occur on other planets with reducing atmospheres and the necessary elements, potentially leading to the origin of extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34;&gt;Planetary Habitability in the Solar System &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines the potential for life on other planets and moons in the Solar System. Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most likely places to find life. The inner Solar System is considered less likely to harbor life, but Venus is still of interest due to its past similarities to Earth. The section discusses the harsh conditions on Venus, including the greenhouse effect and sulfuric acid clouds. Mars is described as a cold and airless desert, but with evidence of past water abundance. The gas giants and ice giants are considered unlikely to contain life, but their moons are of interest. Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are mentioned for their subsurface oceans. Enceladus is highlighted for its eruption columns, which release water to space. The space probe &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned for its detection of complex organic molecules, salts, evidence of hydrothermal activity, hydrogen, and methane on Enceladus. Titan is noted for having liquid bodies on the surface, composed of hydrocarbons, methane, and ethane. Astrobiologist Mary Voytek is mentioned for her view on the unlikelihood of finding large ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-search&#34;&gt;Scientific Search &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-search&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the scientific approach to searching for extraterrestrial life. Astrobiology, also known as exobiology, is the science that studies life in the universe, both on Earth and elsewhere. It seeks to understand how life starts, evolves, and the requirements for its continuous existence. The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. As of September 2017, 3,667 exoplanets in 2,747 systems have been identified. As of 8 February 2021, studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus (via phosphine) and Mars (via methane) were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-basic-life&#34;&gt;Search for Basic Life &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-basic-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for biosignatures within the Solar System and beyond. Scientists study planetary surfaces and examine meteorites for evidence of past or present life. Some claim to have identified evidence that microbial life has existed on Mars. The meteorite ALH84001, formed of rock ejected from Mars, is mentioned for its controversial report of nanobacteria-like structures. The Viking Mars landers are mentioned for their gas emission experiments. NASA scientists Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke are mentioned for their claims of methane signatures on Mars. NASA&amp;rsquo;s Mars Science Laboratory, which landed the &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; rover on Mars, is mentioned for its mission to assess past and present habitability. A group of scientists at Cornell University are mentioned for starting a catalog of microorganisms and their reactions to sunlight. NASA studied meteorites found on Antarctica, finding adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine and xanthine. Sun Kwok, of the University of Hong Kong, is mentioned for his view on the role of organic compounds in the creation of life. Astronomers at Copenhagen University are mentioned for reporting the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). It notes that an extraterrestrial intelligence capable of developing a civilization may be detectable by technosignatures, such as interstellar communications, effects on the atmosphere, and planetary-sized structures. Organizations like the SETI Institute search the cosmos for potential forms of communication, including radio waves and laser pulses. The challenge is distinguishing between natural and artificial signals. Astronomers intend to use artificial intelligence for this. The section also mentions the potential for detecting technosignatures in the atmosphere, such as nitrogen dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and light pollution. The Kardashev scale is introduced as a way to classify civilizations based on their energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extrasolar-planets&#34;&gt;Extrasolar Planets &lt;a href=&#34;#extrasolar-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for exoplanets that may be conducive to life. Astronomers narrow the search to terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars. As of September 2017, over 3,667 exoplanets have been discovered. The Kepler space telescope has detected thousands of candidate planets. There is at least one planet on average per star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an &amp;ldquo;Earth-sized&amp;rdquo; planet in the habitable zone. The nearest known exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b. As of March 2014, the least massive exoplanet known is PSR B1257+12 A, and the most massive planet is DENIS-P J082303.1âˆ’491201 b. The study of planetary habitability considers a wide range of factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life. One sign that a planet probably already contains life is the presence of an atmosphere with significant amounts of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-and-cultural-impact&#34;&gt;History and Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#history-and-cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical and cultural context of the extraterrestrial life debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosmic-pluralism&#34;&gt;Cosmic Pluralism &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-pluralism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the concept of extraterrestrial life back to ancient Greece. Early explanations for celestial objects were based on mythology. Greek scholars were the first to consider that the universe is inherently understandable. Anaximander, Epicurus, and Aristotle are mentioned for their views on the cosmos and the possibility of other worlds. Cosmic pluralism, the belief in numerous &amp;ldquo;worlds&amp;rdquo; in addition to Earth, is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
