      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, often called alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no such life has been conclusively detected, the possibility ranges from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The study of extraterrestrial life falls under the science of astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a framework for understanding the topic of life in the universe. It outlines the conditions necessary for life to arise, noting that the early universe was initially too hot and lacked the necessary elements. The formation of planetary systems and the emergence of organic compounds are discussed, along with the concepts of abiogenesis and panspermia. The section also touches on stellar evolution and the ubiquity of life&amp;rsquo;s raw components in the cosmos. The vastness of the universe and the challenges of studying extraterrestrial life due to immense distances are highlighted. The concept of the circumstellar habitable zone, or &amp;ldquo;Goldilocks zone,&amp;rdquo; is introduced, along with the factors that influence planetary habitability. The section concludes by emphasizing the fleeting nature of species&amp;rsquo; existence on a cosmic scale and the possibility of life arising and becoming extinct on other planets millions or billions of years ago. Avi Loeb&amp;rsquo;s concept of the &amp;ldquo;Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe&amp;rdquo; is mentioned, suggesting a period when liquid water could have existed if planets were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the debate over whether life in the cosmos is common or rare. It presents the argument for ubiquitous extraterrestrial life, based on the size and age of the universe, the ubiquity of life&amp;rsquo;s chemical elements, and the universality of physical laws. Scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view, which is embodied in the Copernican and mediocrity principles. The Rare Earth hypothesis, which posits that life on Earth is possible due to a unique series of factors, is also presented. The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The section concludes by discussing the Fermi paradox, which highlights the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for their existence. Dennis W. Sciama, Zhi-Wei Wang, and Samuel L. Braunstein are mentioned in connection with potential explanations for the Fermi paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section delves into the potential biochemical characteristics of extraterrestrial life. It considers the range of possibilities, from simple microorganisms to complex alien intelligences. The basic requirements for life, including non-equilibrium thermodynamics and a source of energy, are discussed. The importance of water as a solvent is emphasized, along with alternative solvents such as ammonia and hydrocarbons. The section also explores the potential for alternative chemical elements to form the basis of life, considering the requirements for creating complex molecules and storing information. Carbon is highlighted as a versatile element, but the possibility of silicon-based life is also considered. Norman Horowitz&amp;rsquo;s views on carbon-based life are mentioned. The section further discusses the potential for radically different biochemistries, even if based on carbon and water, and the role of natural selection in shaping life. The likelihood of cell membranes, the evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and the potential for convergent evolution are also explored. Simon Conway Morris&amp;rsquo;s ideas on convergent evolution leading to similar kingdoms and features in alien animals are mentioned. The section concludes by discussing the influence of planetary context on life and the research assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34;&gt;Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life &lt;a href=&#34;#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section addresses the common perception that the harsh conditions on other planets make them unlikely to harbor life. It presents evidence that some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs. These environments are considered extreme compared to typical ecosystems, but they support diverse populations of bacteria. The section highlights the importance of chemical reactions, such as chemosynthesis, in these environments, allowing organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon. The reducing nature of early Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere is discussed, along with the possibility that similar carbon-fixing compounds could occur on other planets with reducing atmospheres, potentially leading to the origin of extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34;&gt;Planetary Habitability in the Solar System &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the potential for life on various bodies within the Solar System. Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most likely candidates besides Earth. Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that may have once been similar to Earth. The possibility of microbial life in Venus&amp;rsquo;s high-altitude clouds is mentioned. Mars is described as a cold, airless desert, but its past abundance of water is noted, raising the possibility of past or present life. The gas giants and ice giants are considered unlikely to harbor life, but the potential for life on moons orbiting these planets is explored. Europa&amp;rsquo;s subsurface ocean is highlighted, along with the subsurface oceans of Ganymede and Callisto. Enceladus&amp;rsquo;s eruption columns, which release water into space, are discussed, along with the detection of complex organic molecules, salts, hydrogen, and methane by the Cassini probe. Titan, with its liquid hydrocarbon bodies and subsurface water ocean, is also considered, but its cold temperatures are noted as a limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-search&#34;&gt;Scientific Search &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-search&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces astrobiology as the science that searches for and studies life in the universe. It describes how astrobiology seeks to understand the origin, evolution, and requirements for the continuous existence of life, using the combined perspectives of various scientific disciplines. The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. The number of identified exoplanets is mentioned, along with the potential for other planets and moons in the Solar System to host primitive life. The section also mentions the reported status of studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus and Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-basic-life&#34;&gt;Search for Basic Life &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-basic-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for biosignatures within the Solar System and beyond. Scientists study planetary surfaces and examine meteorites for evidence of past or present life. The controversial report of nanobacteria-like structures in the ALH84001 meteorite is mentioned, along with the experiment on the Viking Mars landers that reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil samples. The section also discusses the NASA scientists who claimed to have found evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars based on methane signatures. The launch of the Mars Science Laboratory and the Curiosity rover&amp;rsquo;s mission to assess past and present habitability on Mars are highlighted. The catalog of microorganisms being compiled by scientists at Cornell University to aid in the search for similar organisms on exoplanets is mentioned. The discovery of adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine in meteorites found on Antarctica is discussed, suggesting that organic molecules may be generated within asteroids and comets. The detection of glycolaldehyde, a sugar molecule needed to form RNA, in a distant star system is also highlighted. The section concludes with the discovery of hydrogen cyanide and other organic molecules in the plumes of Enceladus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section shifts the focus to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. It discusses the concept of technosignatures, which are effects on a planet that may not be caused by natural causes. The three main types of technosignatures considered are interstellar communications, effects on the atmosphere, and planetary-sized structures such as Dyson spheres. Organizations such as the SETI Institute search for potential forms of communication, such as radio waves and laser pulses. The challenges of distinguishing between natural and artificial signals are highlighted, along with the potential use of artificial intelligence in this search. The section also discusses the potential for detecting atmospheric technosignatures, such as nitrogen dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and light pollution. The Kardashev scale is introduced, along with the possibility of detecting Dyson spheres through excess infrared radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extrasolar-planets&#34;&gt;Extrasolar Planets &lt;a href=&#34;#extrasolar-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extrasolar planets that may be conducive to life. Astronomers narrow the search to terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars. The number of discovered exoplanets is mentioned, along with the range of sizes from terrestrial planets to gas giants. The Kepler space telescope&amp;rsquo;s detection of thousands of candidate planets is highlighted. The section notes that there is at least one planet on average per star, and that about 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. The nearest known exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, is mentioned. The least massive and most massive exoplanets known are also identified. The section concludes by emphasizing the importance of considering a wide range of factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-and-cultural-impact&#34;&gt;History and Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#history-and-cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical and cultural context of the search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosmic-pluralism&#34;&gt;Cosmic Pluralism &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-pluralism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the historical development of the concept of extraterrestrial life, beginning with the ideas of ancient Greek scholars. The section highlights the shift from mythological explanations to more rational inquiries about the nature of the universe. The debate between atomists and Aristotelians is discussed, with Epicurus advocating for the existence of other worlds and Aristotle arguing against it. The concept of cosmic pluralism, the belief in numerous worlds beyond Earth, is introduced. The section also mentions the support for cosmic pluralism in Jain scriptures and by medieval Muslim writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-modern-period&#34;&gt;Early Modern Period &lt;a href=&#34;#early-modern-period&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the Copernican Revolution and its impact on the concept of extraterrestrial life. Nicolaus Copernicus&amp;rsquo;s heliocentric model, Johannes Kepler&amp;rsquo;s discovery of elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei&amp;rsquo;s use of the telescope are highlighted as key developments. The section also mentions the resistance to the new ideas from the Catholic Church and Galileo&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-tv-program&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial (TV program) &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-tv-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry details a British-American two-part television documentary miniseries, also known as &lt;em&gt;Alien Worlds&lt;/em&gt; in the UK, which aired in 2005. The program, produced by Big Wave Productions Ltd., explores the hypothetical evolution of alien life on extrasolar planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;series-concept-and-scientific-basis&#34;&gt;Series concept and scientific basis &lt;a href=&#34;#series-concept-and-scientific-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary speculates about life on extrasolar planets, prompted by the discovery of such planets starting in 1989. It highlights the importance of the habitable zone, where temperatures allow liquid water to exist. The program mentions exoplanets Gliese 667 Cc and Gliese 581g (disputed) as examples, noting the challenges in detecting smaller, terrestrial planets. The cancellation of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) project is discussed, along with the shift in focus towards red dwarf stars and binary systems as potential locations for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-1-aurelia&#34;&gt;Episode 1: Aurelia &lt;a href=&#34;#episode-1-aurelia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode focuses on Aurelia, a hypothetical Earth-sized extrasolar planet orbiting a red dwarf star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;planetary-concept&#34;&gt;Planetary concept &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-concept&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists theorize that red dwarf stars, despite being dimmer, offer long lifespans suitable for life evolution. The close proximity required for habitability around a red dwarf would likely result in tidal locking. The program challenges traditional assumptions about tidally locked planets, suggesting they can retain an atmosphere, albeit with unusual characteristics. Aurelia would lack seasons and a day/night cycle, with one side in perpetual darkness and the other experiencing a constant hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifeforms-of-aurelia&#34;&gt;Lifeforms of Aurelia &lt;a href=&#34;#lifeforms-of-aurelia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode speculates on potential lifeforms, assuming carbon-based biology. A plant-like creature called a Stinger Fan is presented as the primary autotroph, with six-legged, beaver-like Mudpods feeding on them. Gulphogs, large, emu-like predators, hunt the Mudpods. Hysteria, tiny, orange creatures similar to tadpoles and piranhas, can form super-organisms to paralyze and consume other animals. All organisms have adaptations to detect and avoid deadly solar flares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-2-blue-moon&#34;&gt;Episode 2: Blue Moon &lt;a href=&#34;#episode-2-blue-moon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode explores the Blue Moon, a fictional moon orbiting a gas giant in a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;planetary-concept-1&#34;&gt;Planetary concept &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-concept-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Moon is covered in water and has a dense atmosphere, allowing for the evolution of enormous flying creatures. It orbits a Water Cloud Jovian planet in a binary star system. The moon&amp;rsquo;s thick atmosphere maintains constant temperatures, and a greenish haze is present due to floating moss and algae. The denser atmosphere allows for massive airborne creatures like Skywhales, which evolved from sea-going animals. High oxygen levels (30%) create a risk of spontaneous combustion during lightning storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifeforms-of-the-blue-moon&#34;&gt;Lifeforms of the Blue Moon &lt;a href=&#34;#lifeforms-of-the-blue-moon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skywhales are preyed upon by insect-like Caped Stalkers, colony-living predators with specialized tasks. Giant Kites, parasol-like grazers, also inhabit the skies. The land is dominated by pagoda trees and balloon plants. The pagoda trees interconnect to reach great heights, collecting rainwater in their hollow leaves. Balloon plants release hydrogen-filled seeds for dispersal. The forest floor features a bioluminescent ecosystem with fungi and other creatures. Mass wildfires pose a threat to the Blue Moon&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem, with balloon plants exploding and releasing seeds during fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-video-releases&#34;&gt;Home video releases &lt;a href=&#34;#home-video-releases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel 4 released a DVD of the documentary in January 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
