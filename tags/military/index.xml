      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1976-tehran-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;1976 Tehran UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-tehran-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1976 Tehran UFO incident involved radar and visual sightings of an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Tehran, Iran, in the early morning hours of September 19, 1976. Two Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) F-4 Phantom II jet interceptors were dispatched to investigate. Pilots reported instrumentation and communication failures as they approached the object, which were restored upon withdrawal. One aircraft also experienced a temporary weapons systems failure while preparing to fire. An initial report was relayed to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff on the day of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 19, 1976, at least four civilians reported a shining object in the sky above Tehran. Lieutenant Yaddi Nazeri and a weapons officer were sent to investigate in an F-4 Phantom II. Nazeri reported losing all instruments and communications upon reaching Tehran, prompting a return to base where the instruments returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Parviz Jafari, a squadron commander, and First Lieutenant Jalal Damirian were dispatched in a second F-4 Phantom II. Jafari acquired radar lock on an object 27 nautical miles away, estimating its size to be comparable to a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. As he approached, Jafari described the object as flashing intense red, green, orange, and blue lights. His plane&amp;rsquo;s communications system shut off. When he attempted to fire an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, his equipment failed and only returned to normal after moving away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jafari reported a round object emerging from the primary object and moving towards him at high speed. His weapons control panel failed, and he lost all instruments and radio communication. Instructed to return to base, Jafari saw the primary, diamond-shaped object and another bright object descending towards the ground, emitting a bright light. The next day, Jafari and Damirian searched the area by helicopter but found nothing. Residents reported hearing a loud noise and seeing a bright flash of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Bridgstock of Griffith University summarized the incident as Iranian air force jets investigating lights in the sky, with at least one jet experiencing electrical failures and an attempt to fire a missile. A nearby airliner also suffered radio failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip J. Klass suggested the pilots initially mistook Jupiter for a UFO. He attributed equipment failures to pilot incompetence and equipment malfunction. Klass noted that only the first F-4 reported equipment failure and had a history of electrical outages. A McDonnell Douglas repair supervisor suggested the radar might have been in &amp;ldquo;manual track&amp;rdquo; mode, leading to misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgstock criticized UFOlogists&amp;rsquo; reports and highlighted Klass&amp;rsquo;s findings that only one aircraft had electrical malfunctions and that the aircrews were tired and could have mistaken stars or meteors for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Dunning noted that the incident occurred during the peak of the Gamma Piscids and Southern Piscids meteorite showers, making observations of falling objects common. A beeping transponder from a C-141 aircraft was found at the supposed crash site. Dunning concluded that the Tehran 1976 UFO case was unusual only because planes chased celestial objects and experienced equipment failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-to-incident-in-the-media&#34;&gt;Reference to incident in the media &lt;a href=&#34;#reference-to-incident-in-the-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Sightings&lt;/em&gt; television program covered the incident in 1994, interviewing participants. &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; listed it among their top 10 UFO sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gallery includes an editorial from the United States Air Force Security Services quarterly &lt;em&gt;MIJI&lt;/em&gt; newsletter, which Dunning describes as a dramatized retelling of the incident offered as an editorial on jamming and interference.&lt;/p&gt;
