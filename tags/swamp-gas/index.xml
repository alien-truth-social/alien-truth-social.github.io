&lt;p&gt;This section details the involvement of J. Allen Hynek, an Air Force UFO expert, who was dispatched to investigate the Dexter and Hillsdale sightings.

He dismissed the Fitzpatrick photograph as being of the moon and Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines the long-term impact of the Michigan UFO sightings. The sightings were listed as a top-ten story for 1966 in Michigan.

The incident has been referenced in popular culture, including &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
