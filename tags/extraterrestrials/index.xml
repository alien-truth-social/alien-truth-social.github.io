      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cattle-mutilation&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilation &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle (and other animals) under unusual and often bloodless circumstances. The phenomenon is often linked to paranormal or supernatural explanations, including cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. The article notes that similar mutilations have been observed in other livestock and wild animals, with specific body parts often removed. Two independent federal investigations in the United States have been conducted on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-history&#34;&gt;Early History &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest documented outbreak of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in England in 1606. Later, Charles Fort collected accounts of cattle mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; Horse Death of 1967 &lt;a href=&#34;#the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the 1967 case of a horse named &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; found mutilated in Alamosa, Colorado. The Pueblo Chieftain published the initial story. The horse&amp;rsquo;s head and neck were skinned and defleshed, and the body displayed precise cuts. No blood was present, and a medicinal odor was reported. This case was the first to link extraterrestrials and UFOs to mutilations. Wadsworth Ayer investigated the case for the Condon Committee and concluded there was no evidence of abnormal causes. Sheriff Ben Phillips suggested a lightning strike as the cause. Two students later confessed to shooting the horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilations 1973â€“1980 &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section covers a wave of cattle mutilations reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico during the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1973-kansas-wave&#34;&gt;1973 Kansas Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1973-kansas-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about suspicious phone calls from someone posing as a USDA official. A series of butchered cows were found on farms in Cloud County, with right ears removed. Local press speculated about a &amp;ldquo;Mad Dog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;phantom&amp;rdquo; butcher. By December, law enforcement reported a wave of cattle deaths in seven counties across Kansas and Nebraska, with sexual organs removed. State Senator Ross Doyen reported a mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&amp;rsquo;s office attributed most deaths to natural causes, but Modlin disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1974-nebraska-wave&#34;&gt;1974 Nebraska Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1974-nebraska-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports resumed in April 1974, with a Nebraska cow found mutilated and drained of blood. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations and helicopter sightings. In May, mutilations were reported in Mills County, Iowa, with coyotes suggested as the cause. By June, mutilations were reported in Lancaster County, Nebraska. Custer County reported helicopter sightings and armed patrols. An unidentified helicopter was spotted hovering above a field where a mutilated cow was later found near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported armed civilian patrols. Cloud County Attorney William Walsh suggested devil-worshiping cultists were responsible. State Sen. John Decamp called for a coordinated investigation. By August 28, 25 mutilations were reported across five Nebraska counties. A rancher near Hartington apparently thwarted a mutilation in progress when he spotted a helicopter. Authorities cautioned the public not to shoot at aircraft. Over 50 law enforcement officials attended a meeting in Center, Nebraska, to discuss the mutilations. Three cases of alleged mutilations were reported in South Dakota. Newsweek became the first national outlet to cover the story. South Dakota Attorney General Kermit Sande reported mutilations in the state. UFO expert J. Allen Hynek denied any link between UFOs and mutilations. Mutilations were also reported in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1975-colorado&#34;&gt;1975 Colorado &lt;a href=&#34;#1975-colorado&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&amp;rsquo;s top story. Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI for help, claiming 130 mutilations in Colorado and reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report indicated an estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing approximately $1 million in damages. Donald E. Flickinger of the Michigan ATF investigated possible links to a &amp;ldquo;Hell-oriented biker gang.&amp;rdquo; The Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. The New York Times published a story examining cattle mutilations across 11 states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34;&gt;1976 Dulce, New Mexico &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1979-public-meeting&#34;&gt;1979 Public Meeting &lt;a href=&#34;#1979-public-meeting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. Paul Bennewitz reported seeing unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. Gabe Valdez reported finding two drugs in the remains of a mutilated bull, one to tranquilize the animal and another to remove blood. On June 14, 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with radar chaff nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-incidents&#34;&gt;Later Incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#later-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since 1967, chiefly in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002. In 1993, photographic evidence surfaced of a mutilated male human corpse found near the Guarapiranga reservoir of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle deaths due to natural causes are extremely common. Unusual cattle deaths are characterized by the absence of sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, rectum, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts are described as &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;surgical.&amp;rdquo; Some animals are reported to have been drained of blood. Nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. Strange marks or imprints near the site have been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;laboratory-reports&#34;&gt;Laboratory Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#laboratory-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory reports on some mutilated animals have shown unusual levels of vitamins or minerals and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. In one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI, an 11-month-old bull belonging to Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, was found mutilated in 1978. The animal&amp;rsquo;s heart, bone, and muscle samples were sent to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, while liver samples were sent to private laboratories. The liver was found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain high levels of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Blood samples were reported to be light pink and did not clot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;helicopter-sightings&#34;&gt;Helicopter Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#helicopter-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters reportedly opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. in Honey Creek, Iowa. On August 20, 1974, the Lincoln Journal Star reported residents seeing unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft resembling a U.S. military helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-investigations&#34;&gt;Official Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#official-investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Mexico Livestock Board sought assistance from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents went undercover. Oklahoma convened a task force. Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34;&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms &lt;a href=&#34;#bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1975, the Minnesota field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) launched an investigation headed by Agent Donald Flickinger to investigate possible connections between cults and cattle mutilation. Flickinger recorded unusual incidents but found insufficient evidence of cult involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34;&gt;Colorado Bureau of Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. 19 animals underwent necropsies at Colorado State University, but no conclusive results emerged. The US Bureau of Land Management grounded all helicopters in Eastern Colorado. By December, the CBI had investigated 203 reports of cattle mutilations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-mexico-state-police&#34;&gt;New Mexico State Police &lt;a href=&#34;#new-mexico-state-police&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 1976, the New Mexico State Police began an investigation headed by Officer Gabe Valdez. Valdez solicited the assistance of retired Sandia National Laboratories scientist Howard Burgess. On the night of July 5, suspecting that cattle might be &amp;ldquo;marked,&amp;rdquo; Burgess and Valdez screened the Gomez herd and found five animals marked with a chemical that fluoresced under ultraviolet light. On June 14, 1981, intact radar chaff was found near a mutilated cow on the Gomez ranch. This investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rommel-investigation&#34;&gt;Rommel Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#rommel-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in May 1979, an investigation was funded by a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and headed by retired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel. The report concluded that the mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but some cases contained anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conventional-explanations&#34;&gt;Conventional Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#conventional-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential explanations for cattle mutilations range from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 20, 1979, C Hibbs of the New Mexico State Veterinary diagnostics Laboratory testified that mutilation fell into three categories: natural causes, deaths caused by pranksters or deviants, and animals mutilated with &amp;ldquo;sharp instruments&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;natural-causes&#34;&gt;Natural Causes &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-causes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing or mutilated mouth, lips, anus, and genitalia are explained as contraction of missing/damaged areas&lt;/p&gt;
