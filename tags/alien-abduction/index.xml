&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of people reporting what they believe to be the real experience of being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. Those who claim to have been abducted are called &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; Most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject claims that alien abduction literally occurs as reported. Some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that most abductees are sane and common people, with psychopathology associated only with some cases. Mack noted the detailed nature of some abduction reports and the existence of a subculture with support groups and a mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, etc.). Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the term &amp;ldquo;alien abduction&amp;rdquo; gained widespread attention, some older stories were speculated to be possible cases, dubbed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1896, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them in Stockton, California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1953, an article in &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; questioned whether humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1955, Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported the mysterious disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, with speculation that they were victims of abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ant√¥nio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 generated widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident was the first in which the claimants described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s and suggested a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became interested in abduction reports in the 1970s and used hypnosis to extract more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980s brought mainstream attention to the subject through works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs, and psychiatrist John E. Mack. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard published a comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees. Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected and that aliens were attempting to create human-alien hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Skeptic Michael Shermer noted that the ubiquity of camera phones increases the burden of evidence for such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; called him &amp;ldquo;a well-meaning man uncritically elaborating on tales of alien abduction, and potentially both cementing and constructing false memories&amp;rdquo;. Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression of claimants helped spread the Grey aliens meme into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. Due to Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief and subsequent promotion of the claims of those he interviewed, his professional reputation suffered, prompting Harvard to review his position in 1994. He retained tenure, but &amp;ldquo;was not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5‚Äì6 percent of the general population allege to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although abduction reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental Health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &amp;ldquo;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&amp;rdquo;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking&amp;rdquo;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &amp;ldquo;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism&amp;rdquo;. UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters but also featured demonization of FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering it important to warn the world of such imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS&amp;rsquo;s definition of &lt;em&gt;abductee&lt;/em&gt;, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; through means like hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although different cases vary in detail, some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp;amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time&lt;/strong&gt;. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany&lt;/strong&gt;. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience&amp;rdquo;, accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says: &amp;ldquo;The entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness &amp;ldquo;the Oz Factor&amp;rdquo;. External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings against environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, figures like psychiatrist John E. Mack have argued that many abductees are sane individuals reporting genuine experiences. A subculture has developed around the phenomenon, complete with support groups and a detailed mythos involving various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics) with specific roles and motivations. Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A November 27, 1896, report in &lt;em&gt;The Evening Mail&lt;/em&gt; of Stockton, California, where Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1953 &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; article questioning if humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s 1955 publication &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt;, which reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Ant√¥nio Vilas-Boas case in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin. Skeptic Peter Rogerson notes that these cases established a template for later abductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

The 1980s brought mainstream attention through works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack, presenting alien abduction as plausible. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard also published a comparative analysis of alleged abductees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than suspected, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been taken. They proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids, with the most advanced stage known as hubrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of systematic interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer noted that camera phones increase the burden of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, criticized Mack for uncritically elaborating on abduction tales and potentially constructing false memories. Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression helped spread the Grey aliens meme. Despite his esteemed reputation, Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief in abduction claims led to a Harvard review in 1994, where he retained tenure but lost professional credibility among colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. CUFOS defines an abductee as someone taken against their will by non-human beings to an extraterrestrial place or spaceship, subjected to examination or communication, with memory of the experience either conscious or recovered through hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though cases vary, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argues there is a fairly consistent sequence of events in a typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the experience, such as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place or expectations of something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown.&amp;rdquo; They also report severe anxiety. This period of foreboding can last for days or be absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the experiencer undergoes an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness, called &amp;ldquo;the Oz Factor&amp;rdquo; by British researchers. External sounds cease to have significance, and the experiencer feels introspective and calm. This marks a transition to &amp;ldquo;limited self-willed mobility.&amp;rdquo; Lights appear, sometimes accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the abduction proceeds, claimants say they walk or are levitated into an alien craft, sometimes through solid objects. Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light into the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. These procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge is often taller and of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John G. Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported by abductors, focusing on the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems like the cardiovascular and respiratory systems receive less attention. Abductors do not appear to wear gloves, and terrestrial medicine constants like pills and tongue depressors are missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, abductees often report other procedures, including imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; involves viewing screens displaying images intended to provoke emotional responses. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is similar, but the images are projected into the experiencer&amp;rsquo;s mind. &amp;ldquo;Staging&amp;rdquo; involves the abductee playing an active role in a vivid, hallucination-like scenario. &amp;ldquo;Testing&amp;rdquo; involves the experiencer operating a complicated electronic device, often finding they know how to operate it despite initial confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abductees sometimes report being subjected&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings about environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that many abductees are sane individuals, with psychopathology only present in some cases. Detailed abduction reports have led to the development of a subculture with support groups and a complex mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types, such as Greys, Reptilians, and Nordics. Some abductees engage in independent research and attribute the lack of wider awareness to extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. One example is Colonel H. G. Shaw&amp;rsquo;s 1896 claim of being harassed by tall, slender humanoids. An article from 1953 asked if flying saucers were kidnapping humans for zoological specimens or vivisection. The 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two landmark cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ant√¥nio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil during the mid-1950s was an early claim but received limited attention initially. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the phenomenon in the 1960s and linked abductions to cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became a key figure in the abductee subculture in the 1970s, using hypnosis to uncover details of remembered events. The 1980s saw increased mainstream attention, with works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack presenting alien abduction as a plausible experience. Thomas E. Bullard&amp;rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than previously thought, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been abducted. They also proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of widespread interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, alien abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer suggests that the ubiquity of camera phones has increased the burden of evidence, contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, suggested that Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression helped spread the Grey aliens meme. Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. His professional reputation suffered due to his belief and promotion of abduction claims, leading to a Harvard review in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. Early studies found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys suggested 5‚Äì6 percent of the general population claim to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While abduction reports are usually made by adults, children sometimes report similar experiences. These reports often share specific details with adult reports, including circumstances, narrative, entities, and aftermaths. Young abductees often have family members who have reported abduction experiences, and family involvement in the military or residence near a military base is also common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that abductees are not different from the general population in terms of psychopathology prevalence. Elizabeth Slater&amp;rsquo;s blind study found abductees prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking,&amp;rdquo; nightmares, and weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally&amp;rsquo;s study concluded that none of the abductees suffered from psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlights links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, and government takeover. He observed the rise of &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism.&amp;rdquo; UFO and abduction stories can be part of stigmatized knowledge narratives. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters, and demonized FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities and may resort to questionable regression therapy. Some espouse conspiracy theories of technological mind control, including implants, to force them to serve a New World Order or for the purposes of the antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. CUFOS defines an abductee as someone taken against their will by non-human beings to an extraterrestrial place or spaceship, subjected to examination or communication, with memories that may be conscious or recovered through hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although cases vary, some UFO researchers argue that there is a fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;: Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp;amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time&lt;/strong&gt;: Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location or with new injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany&lt;/strong&gt;: Abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says that the entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated, with predetermined procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience, such as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place or expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will occur. They also report feeling severe anxiety. Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. External sounds cease to have any significance, and they report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts, lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, often through solid objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge of the operation is often taller than the others and may appear to be of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. The abductors&amp;rsquo; areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems given less attention include the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx, and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the &amp;ldquo;examination.&amp;rdquo; Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives, although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subsequent-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Psychological perspectives on UFO belief</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_0747aa33b15c/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_0747aa33b15c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;psychological-perspectives-on-ufo-belief&#34;&gt;Psychological Perspectives on UFO Belief &lt;a href=&#34;#psychological-perspectives-on-ufo-belief&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of sighting, visitation, and contact with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been the subject of medical and psychological research. Some research suggests psychopathological origins for these claims, while others propose that &amp;ldquo;experiencers&amp;rdquo; may simply have overactive imaginations. Treatment approaches include antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-a-mental-health-disorder&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as a Mental Health Disorder &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-a-mental-health-disorder&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the idea that belief in UFOs and extraterrestrial contact may be linked to underlying mental health conditions. It highlights research suggesting that individuals claiming face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials (ETs) may have distinct psychological profiles compared to those without such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research &lt;a href=&#34;#research&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies are presented that explore the potential link between UFO beliefs and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1983 study in the &lt;em&gt;Canadian Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; examined six individuals claiming extraterrestrial contact and concluded that five suffered from a paranoid delusional state akin to paraphrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1997 study by researchers at the University of Essex found an association between UFO-related beliefs and schizotypy, a construct that may indicate a risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2008 study published in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals alleging alien abduction showed higher levels of dissociativity and a tendency to hallucinate compared to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;individual-experiencers&#34;&gt;Individual Experiencers &lt;a href=&#34;#individual-experiencers&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents case studies of individuals whose belief in alien encounters was linked to mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2000 case study at Boston University Medical Center described a married couple with shared psychotic disorder involving a belief in alien abductions. The husband had a history of mental health issues and suicide attempts, and the couple&amp;rsquo;s shared delusion reinforced their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2008 case at the University of Louisville involved a woman with sleep paralysis who believed she was being abducted by aliens. Her belief was attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the paralysis and cultural acclimation to the alien abduction phenomenon. Psychotherapy improved her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 case study from Nova Southeastern University reported on a 17-year-old boy who felt &amp;ldquo;as if he is being chased by Martians.&amp;rdquo; He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with risperidone, cognitive behavioral therapy, and counseling to stop using marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-a-personality-trait&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as a Personality Trait &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-a-personality-trait&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the idea that belief in UFOs may be related to certain personality traits, particularly fantasy-prone personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons with a fantasy-prone personality spend a significant portion of their lives involved in fantasy and may confuse or mix their fantasies with their real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew suggests that some individuals are prone to exceptionally vivid fantasies and have difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality. Science journalist Eric Smalley hypothesizes that &amp;ldquo;starseeds&amp;rdquo; may be experiencing the Barnum effect, with books providing a sense of authenticity to their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology professor Robert Baker proposed fantasy-prone personality as an explanation for UFO contacts, noting that individuals reporting such contacts are not necessarily psychotic or neurotic, just &amp;ldquo;a little different.&amp;rdquo; Armando Simon, a staff psychologist at the Texas Department of Corrections, argued that belief in UFOs is a cultural norm in North America and not necessarily a sign of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1991 study of 152 individuals reporting alien abductions found that 132 exhibited characteristics consistent with fantasy-prone personality. A 2001 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of UFO and Abduction Studies&lt;/em&gt; found that persons who reported seeing UFOs tended &amp;ldquo;to have a richer fantasy life than those who do not report UFOs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-faulty-perceptuality&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as Faulty Perceptuality &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-faulty-perceptuality&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines how cognitive and perception psychology can explain UFO beliefs, focusing on how human perception, cognitive biases, and psychological tendencies shape beliefs about UAP stimuli. Joey Florez explored UAPs through comparative institutional psychology, focusing on the intuitive and conspiratorial mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florez explains that understanding flawed perception entails considering anomalous phenomena from antiquity, given the over-reliance on superstition and illogical assumptions about the external world. Ancient Greeks interpreted bright flashes in the sky as Zeus firing lightning bolts, reinforcing divine authority and political legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two central modes of information processing, intuitive and conspiratorial, can be used to identify modern UAP beliefs from a cognitive and perceptual perspective. Primary experiences with UAP stimuli often involve intuitive processing, while secondary experiences often involve conspiratorial processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pareidolia refers to anomalies in the brain&amp;rsquo;s initial perception of recognizable patterns in ambiguous visual stimuli, while apophenia is intentional and results in complex convictions of conspiratorial narratives. Research has suggested cognitive reflection and education may reduce narcissistic susceptibility to conspiratorial processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-studies-and-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other Studies and Hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-studies-and-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents additional research and perspectives on UFO belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1993 study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Abnormal Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found no difference in psychopathology and fantasy proneness between persons alleging abduction by UFOs and those with more mundane UFO experiences, concluding that UFO belief did not have a psychopathological origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in 2017 in &lt;em&gt;Motivation and Emotion&lt;/em&gt; found that paranormal beliefs related to extraterrestrial life were partly motivated by the need for meaning in life, with persons experiencing a lack of life meaning demonstrating a higher propensity for such beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard University psychiatrist John E. Mack suggested that some patients related actual encounters with non-humans or non-human controlled UFOs that were not explainable as mental illness. However, a Harvard review committee concluded that Mack was not using &amp;ldquo;rational and scholarly&amp;rdquo; research methods. Mack&amp;rsquo;s use of hypnosis to elicit purportedly repressed memories of abduction experiences has also been criticized. UCLA psychiatrist Fred Frankel and Michael D. Yapko criticized Mack&amp;rsquo;s use of hypnosis, explaining that fantasy and suggestion play a major role during hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grey alien</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_6199f9af3b8b/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_6199f9af3b8b/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and large, black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoids with grey skin, elongated bodies, small chests, and a lack of muscular definition. They are said to lack external human body parts like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their most striking feature is their disproportionately large heads with no hair and large, opaque, black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection further elaborates on the physical appearance of Grey aliens. They are generally depicted as lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from humans. The most prominent feature is their large, black, almond-shaped eyes, often described as lacking eye whites. They are also frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains the origin of the connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system. The association began with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and determined that the aliens&amp;rsquo; home was Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype. It notes that descriptions of beings similar to Greys predate alien encounter claims, citing H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; descriptions of future humans in &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; (1893) and the Eloi in &amp;ldquo;The Time Machine&amp;rdquo; (1895).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the literary and occult origins of the Grey alien concept. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; depictions of future humans and the Eloi are mentioned as early examples of beings with Grey-like characteristics. Aleister Crowley&amp;rsquo;s 1917 encounter with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, described as similar to a modern Grey, is also discussed. Gustav Sandgren&amp;rsquo;s 1933 science fiction novel, &lt;em&gt;Den ok√§nda faran&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;), which describes a race of extraterrestrials with grey skin, bald heads, and large eyes, is identified as a key influence on the modern image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case and its role in popularizing the Grey alien archetype. The Hills claimed that in 1961, they were abducted by grayish-skinned humanoid beings and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s 1990 article suggests that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which featured an alien with large eyes. Carl Sagan echoed these suspicions, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses how Grey aliens became an integral part of ufology and extraterrestrial-related folklore after the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter. Journalist C.D.B. Bryan notes that 73% of reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. The section also mentions the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, and claims that individuals saw the U.S. military handling child-sized beings with oversized heads and slanted eyes. Whitley Strieber&amp;rsquo;s 1987 book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, which described his alleged encounters with Greys, is also discussed. Jimmy Guieu&amp;rsquo;s 1988 interview on TF1&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ciel, mon mardi!&lt;/em&gt; introduced the term &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; to the French public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section further notes that Greys have become the subject of many conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of a government disinformation campaign or a product of mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s 1995 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to depict the autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection analyzes the role of Greys in alien abduction claims. It notes that Greys make up a significant percentage of reported alien encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focus of abduction claims, with abductees reporting that the Greys stare into their eyes during mental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents neurologist Steven Novella&amp;rsquo;s theory that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with their distinctive features representing traits associated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses Frederick V. Malmstrom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis,&amp;rdquo; which suggests that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom argues that the face of a Grey can be reconstructed through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face based on early-childhood sensation and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s argument that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection briefly mentions alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of alleged Grey aliens, including the interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the depiction of Grey aliens in popular culture. It notes that Greys have become a common way to depict extraterrestrials in fiction, supplanting the &amp;ldquo;little green men&amp;rdquo; archetype. Examples include Ultraman (1966), &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;. The section also mentions the increasing association of Greys with conspiracy theories in the 1990s, citing &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; as a prominent example. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The films &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; (2011) and &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; (2013) are also mentioned, as well as the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; (2021) and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt; (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulians, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin, lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition, and having disproportionately short legs. A key feature is their large heads relative to their bodies, devoid of hair, with small orifices for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their eyes are large, opaque, black, and almond-shaped. They are often described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system stems from Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and identified the stars as Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of beings resembling Grey aliens predate reported encounters. H.G. Wells described future humans with similar features in his 1893 article &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; and his 1895 novel &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. In 1917, Aleister Crowley described an entity named Lam with a similar appearance. In 1933, Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, described aliens with grey clothes, bald heads, and large eyes in his science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 brought the Grey alien archetype to public attention in 1965. The Hills claimed they were abducted by grey-skinned humanoids and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which aired shortly before Barney&amp;rsquo;s first hypnotic session. Carl Sagan also suggested &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as a potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter, Greys became a central figure in ufology and extraterrestrial folklore, particularly in the United States, where they account for 73% of reported alien encounters. The alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, was later linked to Greys. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, a book detailing his alleged encounters with Greys, which became a bestseller and was adapted into a film. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu introduced the term &amp;ldquo;les Petits-Gris&amp;rdquo; (little greys) to French audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys have become the subject of conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of government disinformation campaigns or mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage of an autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from Roswell, but later admitted it was a &amp;ldquo;reconstruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greys are frequently associated with alien abduction claims, accounting for a significant percentage of reported encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focal point, with claims of inducing hallucinogenic states or emotions through staring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the presence of Grey aliens in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens have become a common depiction of extraterrestrials in fiction, replacing the earlier &amp;ldquo;little green men.&amp;rdquo; They have appeared in films and television shows such as &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;. During the 1990s, plotlines linking Greys to conspiracy theories became prevalent, as seen in &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The film &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; features a Grey alien who attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; presence in pop culture to government manipulation. The film &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; features child abduction by Greys. Greys also appear in the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-travis-walton-incident&#34;&gt;The Travis Walton Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#the-travis-walton-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Travis Walton incident is an alleged alien abduction that occurred on November 5, 1975, involving American forestry worker Travis Walton in the Apache‚ÄìSitgreaves National Forests near Heber, Arizona. The incident is widely considered a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the alleged abduction, noting that in the early 1970s, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; tabloid offered a substantial prize for proof of extraterrestrial visitors, which may have motivated the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34;&gt;Travis Walton and the Turkey Springs forestry job &lt;a href=&#34;#travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the circumstances surrounding Travis Walton&amp;rsquo;s employment and the forestry contract. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; The forestry job was located in Turkey Springs, about 12 miles south of Heber, Arizona. The crew lived in Snowflake, 30 miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis Walton, his brother Duane, and crew chief Michael H. Rogers are central figures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Motive:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers&amp;rsquo;s forestry contract was behind schedule, potentially leading to financial penalties. The section notes that Walton had a prior criminal record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The Turkey Springs job involved thinning 1,277 acres by August 1975, later extended to November 10. Failure to complete the job could result in a $2,500 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Barney Hill and NBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the potential influence of the 1975 NBC television movie &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt;, which dramatized the alleged abduction of Barney and Betty Hill. It suggests that the film may have inspired Walton and Rogers to fabricate their own abduction story. Skeptics and psychologists are quoted arguing that the film could have motivated someone to claim an abduction for attention. It also mentions that Travis Walton told his mother not to worry if he were ever abducted by aliens because he would return safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the events of November 5, 1975, when Michael H. Rogers reported Travis Walton missing. The crew claimed they saw a lit object near the roadway, Walton approached it, and was struck by a light. The crew drove away in fear and returned to find Walton and the object gone. The police were notified, and a search was initiated. Deputy Kenneth Coplan noted the calm reaction of Walton&amp;rsquo;s mother to the news of his disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-person-investigation&#34;&gt;Missing person investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-person-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the search efforts and initial investigation following Walton&amp;rsquo;s disappearance. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Party:&lt;/strong&gt; A search party of nearly 50 people scoured the Turkey Springs area without success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&amp;rsquo;s Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Law enforcement were surprised by the calm reaction of Travis&amp;rsquo;s mother, who believed he was no longer on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFO Interest:&lt;/strong&gt; It was revealed that Travis, Duane, and their mother were interested in UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers and the crew underwent polygraph examinations to determine if they had harmed Walton. Five were deemed truthful, while one was inconclusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act of God Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers discussed the Forestry contract and the potential for an &amp;ldquo;Act of God&amp;rdquo; clause to excuse the delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walton-returns&#34;&gt;Walton returns &lt;a href=&#34;#walton-returns&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes Walton&amp;rsquo;s reappearance and subsequent events. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton called his sister&amp;rsquo;s home from a payphone in Heber, Arizona, on November 12, shortly after midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deputy Glen Flake:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy Flake witnessed Duane Walton transferring fuel from one car to another after having forgotten to purchase gas before local stations closed. Flake did not reveal that they knew Travis had returned home, and Duane did not tell the deputy that Travis had been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Duane sought medical attention for Travis, consulting with a hypnotherapist and later two medical doctors who were also amateur UFO investigators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheriff Gillespie:&lt;/strong&gt; Sheriff Gillespie insisted on interviewing Travis, but Duane and Travis demanded that the interview not be recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; provided a suite at the Sheraton Inn in Scottsdale in exchange for exclusive access to Walton and his story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis skipped a polygraph interview with police, but was later interviewed by Jack McCarthy a free-lance polygraph examiner arranged by a UFO group and the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;. McCarthy concluded that Travis was engaged in a &amp;ldquo;gross deception&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Television Interview:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton appeared on Phoenix television, claiming he lost consciousness and awoke in a hospital-like room with short, bald creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publicity-and-popular-culture&#34;&gt;Publicity and popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the media attention and cultural impact of the Walton incident. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for &amp;ldquo;best UFO case of the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism:&lt;/strong&gt; Skeptics, including Philip J. Klass, viewed the story as a hoax for financial gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book and Film:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton wrote &lt;em&gt;The Walton Experience&lt;/em&gt; in 1978, which was adapted into the 1993 film &lt;em&gt;Fire in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section notes that the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; publicized the opinion of a private polygraph examiner who reported the witnesses as being truthful, but omitted all mention of Walton&amp;rsquo;s prior polygraph examiner who concluded Walton was being &amp;ldquo;grossly deceptive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents Robert Sheaffer&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis that Rogers and the Waltons used a nearby fire lookout tower to create the illusion of a UFO. Sheaffer suggests that Travis walked towards the tower, which was brightly lit, and an accomplice illuminated him with a spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Narrative of the abduction phenomenon</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_db6885cde2ad/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 09:44:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;narrative-of-the-abduction-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Narrative of the Abduction Phenomenon &lt;a href=&#34;#narrative-of-the-abduction-phenomenon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the alleged core similarities in claims of alien abduction experiences. Proponents believe these similarities point to an objective reality, while skeptics attribute them to psychological and cultural factors. Skeptics also suggest that some reports are hoaxes. Believers argue that the independent generation of similar narratives by individuals is unlikely. Some investigators attempt to confirm abduction claims through observation or experimentation, but these efforts are often dismissed as pseudoscientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the typical sequence of events in an alien abduction narrative, according to UFO researchers like folklorist Thomas E. Bullard. The sequence includes capture, examination, conference, tour, loss of time, return, theophany, and aftermath. It notes that not all abductions feature all events and that some researchers, like Budd Hopkins and David M. Jacobs, have been accused of selectively using data to fit a specific paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nymans-alternate-outline&#34;&gt;Nyman&amp;rsquo;s Alternate Outline &lt;a href=&#34;#nymans-alternate-outline&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents an alternative model for abduction narratives composed by abduction researcher Joe Nyman. The model includes anxious anticipation, transition of consciousness, psycho-physical imposition, reassurance, transition back to normal consciousness, rapid forgetfulness, a marker stage, and a cycle interval. David M. Jacobs is quoted, emphasizing the orchestrated nature of abduction events. The section also mentions the connection between alien abductions and UFO reports, as well as the common portrayal of abductors as &amp;ldquo;Greys.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the events leading up to the alleged abduction. It describes unusual feelings, such as a compulsive desire to be in a certain place or expectations of something unknown. Abductees report a shift in consciousness, often accompanied by lights and a strange mist. They may be levitated into an alien craft, sometimes through solid objects. The section also mentions scenarios involving automobiles, UFO sightings, mechanical failures, and amnesia. The use of a pencil-sized device by the aliens to ensure compliance is also noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the medical procedures and examinations performed by alien beings during the abduction. It highlights the differences between these procedures and typical human medicine, as noted by physician and abduction researcher John G. Miller. The section discusses the abductors&amp;rsquo; areas of interest, such as the cranium, nervous system, skin, and reproductive system, as well as the lack of gloves and other standard medical practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cranial-procedures&#34;&gt;Cranial Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#cranial-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the specific procedures allegedly performed on the abductee&amp;rsquo;s head. Yvonne Smith, a hypnotherapist and abduction researcher, notes similarities in reports of hypnotically retrieved abduction memories. Common procedures include feelings of pressure, insertion of needles into the scalp, drilling into the skull, and procedures involving the ears and nasal passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reproductive-gynecological-and-urological-procedures&#34;&gt;Reproductive, Gynecological and Urological Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#reproductive-gynecological-and-urological-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the gynecological aspects of the abduction experience reported by many female abductees. It notes the absence of standard gynecological practices. Reports of sex with human-alien hybrids or other abductees are mentioned. The insertion of a long needle-like contraption into a woman&amp;rsquo;s navel is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-procedures&#34;&gt;Other Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#other-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers other procedures reported by abductees, such as skin scrapings. Physician and abduction researcher John Altshuler dismisses speculation that the aliens are collecting skin samples to analyze DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reported-devices-and-instruments&#34;&gt;Reported Devices and Instruments &lt;a href=&#34;#reported-devices-and-instruments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the devices and instruments allegedly used by the aliens during the abduction. It mentions a black, cylindrical device with a bluish light used to render abductees compliant. The placement of devices on the chest and the use of diffused colored lights are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subsequent-abduction-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent Abduction Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-abduction-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details procedures that occur after the medical exam, including imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing. Imaging involves viewing screens with emotionally provocative images. Envisioning involves images projected into the abductee&amp;rsquo;s mind. Staging involves the abductee interacting with an illusionary scenario. Testing involves operating a complicated electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;child-presentation&#34;&gt;Child Presentation &lt;a href=&#34;#child-presentation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the &amp;ldquo;child presentation&amp;rdquo; phase, where abductees are shown hybrid children. It is speculated that these children are the products of reproductive procedures. Folklorist Thomas Bullard could not identify this phase in his study of abduction reports. The section discusses the varying ages of the hybrid children, their roles in assisting the abductors, and the expectations placed on the abductees during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;less-common-elements&#34;&gt;Less Common Elements &lt;a href=&#34;#less-common-elements&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses less prominent aspects of abduction claims, based on a study by folklorist Thomas E. Bullard. These elements include the conference, the tour, the journey, and theophany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conference&#34;&gt;Conference &lt;a href=&#34;#conference&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the conference phase, where the entities engage in discussions with the abductee. The discussions may involve interrogation sessions, explanatory segments, task assignments, warnings, and prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tour&#34;&gt;Tour &lt;a href=&#34;#tour&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the rare occurrence of tours of the abductors&amp;rsquo; craft. Abduction claimants often find the &amp;ldquo;engine room&amp;rdquo; to be the most memorable aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;journey&#34;&gt;Journey &lt;a href=&#34;#journey&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes reports of further transport within the abductors&amp;rsquo; vessel, sometimes to other planets. The abductee may be placed in a protective environment, such as a chamber filled with liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;theophany&#34;&gt;Theophany &lt;a href=&#34;#theophany&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the rare experience of &amp;ldquo;theophany,&amp;rdquo; a sense of oneness with the universe or with God. Psychologist Susan A. Clancy notes that abductees often feel &amp;ldquo;changed&amp;rdquo; by their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;return&#34;&gt;Return &lt;a href=&#34;#return&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the return of the abductees to Earth, usually to the same location and circumstances they were in prior to being taken. Explicit memories of the abduction experience are usually absent, and the abductee may realize they have experienced &amp;ldquo;missing time.&amp;rdquo; The section also mentions instances where the abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-time&#34;&gt;Missing Time &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-time&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the phenomenon of &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; in abduction accounts. Don C. Donderi notes that there is often independent confirmation of missing time, as well as confirmation of abduction events reported under hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;realization-event&#34;&gt;Realization Event &lt;a href=&#34;#realization-event&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the &amp;ldquo;realization event,&amp;rdquo; the insight or development leading a person to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon. Physician and abduction researcher John G. Miller identifies common triggers for the realization event, such as tangible evidence, conversations with other abductees, exposure to depictions of the abduction phenomenon in popular culture, and hypnotic retrieval of abduction memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skeptical-response&#34;&gt;Skeptical Response &lt;a href=&#34;#skeptical-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the skeptical perspective on the abduction phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;role-of-hypnosis-and-investigators-in-shaping-the-narrative&#34;&gt;Role of Hypnosis and Investigators in Shaping the Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#role-of-hypnosis-and-investigators-in-shaping-the-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses how individual abduction researchers appear to exert influence on the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall. Skeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass argue that this influence reinforces the preconceived biases of the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effect-of-geography-and-culture-on-abduction-reports&#34;&gt;Effect of Geography and Culture on Abduction Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#effect-of-geography-and-culture-on-abduction-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the variation in abduction reports across cultures and geographic boundaries. Skeptics assert that this variation supports a psycho-social hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of the abduction phenomenon. The section also notes that the contents and structure of the &amp;ldquo;abduction narrative&amp;rdquo; were already established in fictional form by 1930 in a Buck Rogers strip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;making-contact-a-serious-handbook-for-locating-and-communicating-with-extraterrestrials&#34;&gt;Making Contact: A Serious Handbook for Locating and Communicating With Extraterrestrials &lt;a href=&#34;#making-contact-a-serious-handbook-for-locating-and-communicating-with-extraterrestrials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making Contact: A Serious Handbook for Locating and Communicating With Extraterrestrials&lt;/em&gt; is a book published in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents &lt;a href=&#34;#contents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the book&amp;rsquo;s subject matter, which encompasses various aspects of close encounters with extraterrestrials.
