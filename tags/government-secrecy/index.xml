      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;area-51&#34;&gt;Area 51 &lt;a href=&#34;#area-51&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&amp;rsquo;s a remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&amp;rsquo;s believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF and CIA acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it a frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&amp;rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Area 51 is located in southern Nevada, 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas. The surrounding area, including the town of Rachel, is a popular tourist destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography &lt;a href=&#34;#geography&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;area-51-1&#34;&gt;Area 51 &lt;a href=&#34;#area-51-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original rectangular base is part of the &amp;ldquo;Groom box,&amp;rdquo; a rectangular area of restricted airspace. It&amp;rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with roads leading to Mercury and Yucca Flat. Groom Lake Road runs northeast through the Jumbled Hills, past a security checkpoint, and descends to the Tikaboo Valley, converging with State Route 375, the &amp;ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&amp;rdquo; south of Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;groom-lake&#34;&gt;Groom Lake &lt;a href=&#34;#groom-lake&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groom Lake is a salt flat in Nevada used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (XTA/KXTA) on the north of the Area 51 USAF military installation. The lake is located within the Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, south of Rachel, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the name &amp;ldquo;Area 51&amp;rdquo; is unclear. The correct names for the facility are Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake. The facility has also been referred to as &amp;ldquo;Dreamland&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch&amp;rdquo;. Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864, and the English company &lt;em&gt;Groome Lead Mines Limited&lt;/em&gt; financed the Conception Mines in the 1870s. The airfield on the Groom Lake site began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-2-program&#34;&gt;U-2 program &lt;a href=&#34;#u-2-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE: the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Project director Richard M. Bissell Jr. understood that the flight test and pilot training programs could not be conducted at Edwards Air Force Base or Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s Palmdale facility. Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s U-2 designer Kelly Johnson stated that Groom Lake was ideal due to the dry lake bed and the protection from visitors afforded by the Emigrant Valley&amp;rsquo;s mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter. The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated &amp;ldquo;Area 51&amp;rdquo; on the map, and to add it to the Nevada Test Site. Johnson named the area &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch&amp;rdquo; to encourage workers to move to the new facility. The Ranch initially consisted of little more than a few shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. The base received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oxcart-program&#34;&gt;OXCART program &lt;a href=&#34;#oxcart-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project OXCART was established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12. This included testing at Groom Lake, which had inadequate facilities. A-12 test facility construction began in September 1960, including a new runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) began construction of &amp;ldquo;Project 51&amp;rdquo; on 1 October 1960. The contractor upgraded base facilities and built a new runway diagonally across the southwest corner of the lakebed. They marked an Archimedean spiral on the dry lake approximately two miles (three kilometers) across so that an A-12 pilot approaching the end of the overrun could abort instead of plunging into the sagebrush. Area 51 pilots called it &amp;ldquo;The Hook&amp;rdquo;. By August 1961, construction of the essential facilities was complete. Security was enhanced for the arrival of OXCART and the small mine was closed in the Groom basin. In January 1962, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expanded the restricted airspace in the vicinity of Groom Lake. The CIA facility received eight USAF F-101 Voodoos for training, two T-33 Shooting Star trainers, a C-130 Hercules for cargo transport, a U-3A for administrative purposes, a helicopter for search and rescue, and a Cessna 180 for liaison use, and Lockheed provided an F-104 Starfighter for use as a chase plane. The first A-12 test aircraft was covertly trucked from Burbank on 26 February 1962 and arrived at Groom Lake on 28 February. It made its first flight 26 April 1962 when the base had over 1,000 personnel. Groom was also the site of the first Lockheed D-21 drone test flight on 22 December 1964. By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA-operated &amp;ldquo;1129th Special Activities Squadron&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;d-21-tagboard&#34;&gt;D-21 Tagboard &lt;a href=&#34;#d-21-tagboard&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of Gary Powers&amp;rsquo; U-2 over the Soviet Union, there were several discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. The Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The project designated &amp;ldquo;Q-12&amp;rdquo; was renamed the &amp;ldquo;D-21&amp;rdquo;. (The &amp;ldquo;12&amp;rdquo; was reversed to &amp;ldquo;21&amp;rdquo;). &amp;ldquo;Tagboard&amp;rdquo; was the project&amp;rsquo;s code name. The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the &amp;ldquo;M-21&amp;rdquo;. Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight, suffered from an unstart of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program. The remaining drones were transferred by a C-5A and placed in dead storage. The tooling used to build the D-21Bs was ordered destroyed. In 1993, the B-52/D-21B program was made public. That same year, the surviving D-21Bs were released to museums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foreign-technology-evaluation&#34;&gt;Foreign technology evaluation &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-technology-evaluation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured Soviet fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Munir Redfa&amp;rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 from Iraq for Israel&amp;rsquo;s Mossad in Operation Diamond led to the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters. In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel after being ordered to attack Iraqi Kurd villages with napalm. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in late 1967 for study. Israel loaned the MiG-21 to the US Air Force from January 1968 to April 1968. In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy&amp;rsquo;s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet-made aircraft in simulated air combat training. On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of MiG-17Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel. Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed Top Gun school at NAS Miramar&lt;/p&gt;
