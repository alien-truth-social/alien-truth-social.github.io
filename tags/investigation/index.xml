      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; were initially used to describe UFOs, stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass a broader range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged later, gaining traction in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and earthbound explanations for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs, upon investigation, are identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft (military, civilian, experimental, drones), astronomical objects (bright stars, planets, meteors), balloons (weather, research, toy), hoaxes, light phenomena (mirages, flares, searchlights), other atmospheric objects (birds, unusual clouds, plasma), and psychological effects (pareidolia, hallucinations). Studies, such as one by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry, have found that most sightings are honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena due to inexperience or misperception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes things moving through the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts and leaflets from the 15th and 16th centuries depicting &amp;ldquo;miracles&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sky spectacles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Martin&amp;rsquo;s 1878 report of a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying at high speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings ranged from St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire to German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects over Scandinavia, referred to as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with the widely reported sighting by Kenneth Arnold in 1947, who described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers.&amp;rdquo; This sparked a media frenzy and numerous reports of similar sightings, including the Roswell incident. UFO enthusiasts formed &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs,&amp;rdquo; and books promoting the extraterrestrial hypothesis gained popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., media accounts and speculation led to the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. From 1947 to 1969, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. The CIA also conducted a study in 1952, concluding that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat. Public pressure for declassification of UFO records mounted, but the CIA resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official U.S. Air Force interest waned after the Condon Report in 1969, which concluded that further study of UFOs was not justified. However, some government documents suggest that non-public UFO investigations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became part of popular culture&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the supernatural and paranormal. The Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gained notoriety, and UFO stories were featured in TV shows and films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention resurfaced with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream interest in UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government-sponsored programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims. Congressional hearings were held to discuss military reports of UAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls showing that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-cases-and-incidents&#34;&gt;Notable cases and incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-cases-and-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rendlesham Forest incident (1980) involved reported sightings of unexplained lights near Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk, England.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;france&#34;&gt;France &lt;a href=&#34;#france&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kecksburg UFO incident (1965) in Pennsylvania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travis Walton&amp;rsquo;s alleged alien abduction (1975).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigations-of-reports&#34;&gt;Investigations of reports &lt;a href=&#34;#investigations-of-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO reports have been investigated by governments and academics in various countries. No official government investigation has publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects of extraterrestrial origin, or a threat to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable government studies include the Swedish military&amp;rsquo;s ghost rockets investigation, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, and Brazil&amp;rsquo;s OperaÃ§Ã£o Prato. France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN) since 1977, and Uruguay has had a similar investigation since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;americas&#34;&gt;Americas &lt;a href=&#34;#americas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brazil-19522016&#34;&gt;Brazil (1952â€“2016) &lt;a href=&#34;#brazil-19522016&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Archives of Brazil has been receiving documentation from the Brazilian Air Force regarding UFO investigations between 1952 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;chile-c-1968&#34;&gt;Chile (c. 1968) &lt;a href=&#34;#chile-c-1968&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEFAA (previously CEFAA) has been receiving case reports of UFO sightings in Chile since 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;canada-c-1950&#34;&gt;Canada (c. 1950) &lt;a href=&#34;#canada-c-1950&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of National Defence has investigated UFO reports across Canada, including the Falcon Lake incident and the Shag Harbour UFO incident. Early Canadian studies included Project Magnet and Project Second Storey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;united-states-1&#34;&gt;United States &lt;a href=&#34;#united-states-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigations into UFOs include Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, the CIA&amp;rsquo;s Directorate of Science &amp;amp; Technology study, the Robertson Panel, the Brookings Report, the Condon Committee, the RAND Corporation study, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Sturrock panel, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force Regulation 200-2 (1953â€“1954) defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and outlined investigation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Committee&amp;rsquo;s negative conclusion in 1968 led to the closure of Project Blue Book in 1970. However, some documents suggest that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, the White House released an official response stating that the U.S. government has no evidence of extraterrestrial life or government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on UAPs, finding that the UAPTF was unable to identify 143 objects spotted between 2004 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;uruguay-c-1989&#34;&gt;Uruguay (c. 1989) &lt;a href=&#34;#uruguay-c-1989&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uruguayan Air Force has conducted UFO investigations since 1989, analyzing approximately 2,100 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;europe&#34;&gt;Europe &lt;a href=&#34;#europe&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2007, the French space agency CNES published an archive of UFO sightings online. French studies include GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN, which has studied 6,000 cases, with about 22% remaining unexplained. In 2008, the Sigma Commission was created to investigate UFO phenomena worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;italy-19332005&#34;&gt;Italy (1933â€“2005) &lt;a href=&#34;#italy-19332005&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alleged UFO sightings have gradually increased since the war, peaking in 1978 and 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flying Saucer Working Party</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;flying-saucer-working-party&#34;&gt;Flying Saucer Working Party &lt;a href=&#34;#flying-saucer-working-party&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flying Saucer Working Party (FSWP) was the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence&amp;rsquo;s (MOD) initial formal investigation into UFOs. It originated from a study commissioned in 1950 by Sir Henry Tizard, the MOD&amp;rsquo;s Chief Scientific Adviser and a radar expert. Tizard insisted that UFO sightings should be scientifically examined, leading to the establishment of the FSWP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up&#34;&gt;Set-up &lt;a href=&#34;#set-up&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flying Saucer Working Party was established in October 1950 by Sir Henry Tizard. Tizard believed UFO reports warranted serious study. He authorized a small team to investigate the phenomenon. The group&amp;rsquo;s final report was published in June 1951. It was released to UFO researchers Dr. David Clarke and Andy Roberts in 2001 by the MOD, following requests made under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Working Party concluded that all studied reports could be explained by astronomical or meteorological phenomena, misidentification of objects, optical illusions, psychological delusions, or deliberate hoaxes. The report recommended ceasing further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena unless material evidence emerged. A detailed commentary and analysis of this material can be found at the Real UFO Project website, including scans of the report and associated documents.&lt;/p&gt;
