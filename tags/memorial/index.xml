&lt;p&gt;The Ã„ngelholm UFO memorial is a monument in Kronoskogen forest near Ã„ngelholm, Sweden, commemorating an alleged UFO landing in 1946. It features a concrete model of a flying saucer, purported landing impressions, and copper plaques with eyewitness testimony. The monument is based on the account of GÃ¶sta Carlsson, who claimed his success was due to a UFO encounter. Erected in 1972, it is maintained by the local government and is a tourist destination and national heritage site, despite lacking corroborating evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details the background of GÃ¶sta Carlsson, the man behind the alleged UFO encounter and the subsequent memorial. Carlsson (1918â€“2003) founded the herbal medicine company Cernelle in 1953, becoming known as &lt;em&gt;Pollenkungen&lt;/em&gt; due to his success with bee pollen extracts. He invested in the local ice hockey club, RÃ¶gle BK, and attributed his success to a May 1946 UFO encounter in Kronoskogen forest near Ã„ngelholm. He claimed to have seen a disc-shaped craft with a crew, and that the encounter inspired him to experiment with pollen. He didn&amp;rsquo;t publicly discuss the encounter until the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;statements&#34;&gt;Statements &lt;a href=&#34;#statements&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers statements made by Carlsson and others regarding the alleged UFO encounter. Carlsson first spoke publicly about the incident in a 1971 interview with journalist Eugen Semitjov. Semitjov visited the clearing with Carlsson and found no definitive marks. A quartz rod Carlsson claimed to have found at the site was analyzed and found to be ordinary. In 1995, ufologist Clas Svahn co-authored a book with Carlsson, &lt;em&gt;MÃ¶tet i glÃ¤ntan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The meeting in the clearing&lt;/em&gt;), but ultimately disbelieved the encounter while acknowledging Carlsson&amp;rsquo;s conviction. Historian Dick Harrison described Carlsson&amp;rsquo;s narrative as &amp;ldquo;alleged but not proven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monument&#34;&gt;Monument &lt;a href=&#34;#monument&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the physical features of the Ã„ngelholm UFO memorial. At the center is a one-eighth-scale concrete model of a flying saucer, based on Carlsson&amp;rsquo;s sketches. Concrete paths depict landing impressions, and copper plaques on pillars provide eyewitness testimony. The monument is a Swedish National Heritage Board site (RAÃ„ StrÃ¶velstorp 47:1). Located near Ã„ngelholm and the beach, it attracts tourists. Guided tours are common, often starting from the SkÃ¥ne Line bunkers. Ã„ngelholm Municipality maintains the site.&lt;/p&gt;
