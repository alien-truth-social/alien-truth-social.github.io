&lt;p&gt;Roswell is a city located in Chaves County, New Mexico, serving as its county seat. It&amp;rsquo;s known for the alleged Roswell incident and is home to the New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI) and an Eastern New Mexico University campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area was first settled by pioneers from Missouri in 1865, though they abandoned the site due to lack of water. Van C. Smith and Aaron Wilburn established a general store and post office in 1869, which marked the beginning of the modern city. Smith named the town after his father, Roswell Smith. Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family acquired the land in 1877. The discovery of a major aquifer in 1890 and the arrival of the Pecos Valley Railroad in 1892 spurred growth. During World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was located nearby, with German POWs contributing to infrastructure projects. Walker Air Force Base was important from 1941 to 1967, after which Roswell transitioned into a retirement community. The city has capitalized on the Roswell UFO incident, attracting tourists interested in UFOs and aliens. In 2024, Roswell was chosen to host the Reno Air Races starting in 2025. Felix Baumgartner&amp;rsquo;s record-breaking skydive occurred in Roswell in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

The initial &lt;em&gt;Simpsons Comics&lt;/em&gt; story and the first three issues of the &lt;em&gt;Roswell, Little Green Man&lt;/em&gt; series, which detail the origin story of Roswell, were collected in the trade paperback &lt;em&gt;Roswell Walks Among Us&lt;/em&gt; in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
