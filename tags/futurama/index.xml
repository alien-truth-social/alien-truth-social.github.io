      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;roswell-that-ends-well&#34;&gt;Roswell That Ends Well &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-that-ends-well&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roswell That Ends Well&amp;rdquo; is the 19th episode of the third season of the animated television series &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;. It originally aired on December 9, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planet Express crew, while observing a supernova, accidentally time travel to 1947 after Fry microwaves a metal pan of popcorn. They crash-land in Roswell, New Mexico, becoming part of the Roswell Incident. Bender is shattered upon impact. The crew searches for a way back to the 31st century. Zoidberg is captured by the U.S. military and experimented on at Roswell Air Base. The military reconstructs Bender&amp;rsquo;s body into a flying saucer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew needs a microwave oven to return to their time. Professor Farnsworth warns Fry against interacting with his grandfather, Enos, to avoid a grandfather paradox. Fry tries to protect Enos, but Enos dies in a nuclear weapon test. Fry sleeps with Mildred, Enos&amp;rsquo;s fiancÃ©e, and realizes she is his grandmother, making him his own grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew storms Roswell Air Base to steal a microwave dish. Fry and Leela rescue Zoidberg from an alien autopsy. Farnsworth retrieves Bender&amp;rsquo;s body. While time jumping, Bender&amp;rsquo;s head is left behind. Back in the 31st century, the crew returns to Roswell, finds Bender&amp;rsquo;s head, and reattaches it to his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing team developed the episode from ideas initially considered for &amp;ldquo;Anthology of Interest II.&amp;rdquo; The writers initially avoided time travel in &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;, but changed their minds. They made the time travel unintentional, triggered by a supernova, to avoid regular time travel. The episode was directed by Rich Moore, who used screen position and character movement to represent time travel. Actions to the left represented the past, while actions to the right indicated progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-references&#34;&gt;Cultural references &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode references time travel stories like &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt;. It also shares similarities with the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&lt;/em&gt; episode &amp;ldquo;Little Green Men.&amp;rdquo; Bender&amp;rsquo;s head buried in the sand is similar to Data&amp;rsquo;s head in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;. Enos&amp;rsquo;s character is based on Gomer Pyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast-and-reception&#34;&gt;Broadcast and reception &lt;a href=&#34;#broadcast-and-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roswell That Ends Well&amp;rdquo; won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (Programming Less Than One Hour) in 2002. Rich Moore won an Annie Award for directing. IGN ranked it as one of the best &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; episodes. David X. Cohen considered it one of his favorite episodes. &lt;em&gt;Sci Fi Weekly&lt;/em&gt; gave it an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; grade. Despite critical acclaim, the episode had low ratings during its original airing.&lt;/p&gt;
