&lt;p&gt;Maxwell &amp;ldquo;Max&amp;rdquo; Evans is a fictional character created by Melinda Metz for the &lt;em&gt;Roswell High&lt;/em&gt; book series and adapted for the &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt; television series (1999-2002). He is portrayed by Jason Behr in the original series and by Nathan Parsons in the CW reboot. Max is a central character throughout the series, first appearing in the pilot episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fictional-character-summary&#34;&gt;Fictional character summary &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-character-summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the TV character, distinguishing it from the &lt;em&gt;Roswell High&lt;/em&gt; book version. Max&amp;rsquo;s backstory reveals that in a previous life, he was Zan, the king of Antar. After Zan&amp;rsquo;s death, his DNA and human DNA were used to create alien/human hybrids or clones, including Isabel Evans (Vilandra, Zan&amp;rsquo;s sister), Michael Guerin (Rath, Vilandra&amp;rsquo;s betrothed), and Tess Harding (Ava, Zan&amp;rsquo;s bride). These clones were sent to Earth to escape their enemies, particularly Kivar. The craft carrying Max, Isabel, Michael, and Tess crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. Army initially took the alien pods, but they were rescued and hidden. The clones emerged in 1989, appearing as children. Max and Isabel were adopted by the Evans, while Michael ended up in foster care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max is presented as shy and introverted, a facade necessitated by his hybrid nature. He is a complex character, displaying both timidity and passion.

He takes responsibility for his actions and is known for his unique healing powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max possesses molecular manipulation and telekinesis, abilities shared by the other hybrids. His unique power is healing through physical contact, famously used to save Liz Parker in the pilot episode. He also develops the ability to generate a force field. It is suggested that his healing ability can trigger the development of alien powers in those he heals, such as Liz Parker.&lt;/p&gt;
