      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nordic-aliens&#34;&gt;Nordic Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#nordic-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ufology, &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites&amp;rdquo; are terms used to describe alleged humanoid extraterrestrials who purportedly resemble Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans. They are said to originate from the Pleiades star cluster and are often described by contactees as being taller than average humans (6-7 ft), with blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some reports also mention pale-blue/grey or pastel purple skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stories of Nordic aliens may have been inspired by the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;. Within the ufology community, these aliens are often associated with spiritual growth, benevolence, and protection. They are described as concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic abilities, and exhibiting paternal, watchful, affectionate, and youthful characteristics. While popular in the 1950s, claims of encounters with Nordic aliens have become less frequent, with the grey alien becoming more prominent in reported extraterrestrial encounters. David J. Skal, a cultural historian, and Stephanie Kelley-Romano, a professor at Bates College, are mentioned in relation to their perspectives on Nordic aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;crop-circle&#34;&gt;Crop Circle &lt;a href=&#34;#crop-circle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crop circle, also known as a crop formation or corn circle, is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural causes or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two hoaxers, claimed responsibility for creating over 200 crop circles throughout England. Reported circles in the United Kingdom appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population, and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury, and usually appear overnight. Archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but these do not appear overnight, and are always in the same places every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1678 news pamphlet &lt;em&gt;The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire&lt;/em&gt; describes a crop whose stalks were cut rather than bent. In 1686, English naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms in &lt;em&gt;The Natural History of Stafford-Shire&lt;/em&gt;, proposing air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991, meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles. An 1880 letter to the editor of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how several circles of flattened crops in a field were formed under suspicious circumstances and possibly caused by &amp;ldquo;cyclonic wind action&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;20th-century&#34;&gt;20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester. In &lt;em&gt;Fortean Times,&lt;/em&gt; David Wood reported that in 1940 he made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. In 1963, Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire and several circular and elliptical areas in nearby wheat fields. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes. During the 1960s, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada. On 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo;. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported they started creating crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo; case. The first film to depict a geometric crop circle, in this case created by super-intelligent ants, was the 1974 science-fiction film &lt;em&gt;Phase IV&lt;/em&gt;. The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared and spread since the late 1970s. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity. The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bower-and-chorley&#34;&gt;Bower and Chorley &lt;a href=&#34;#bower-and-chorley&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, made headlines by saying they had started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978, using simple tools. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a &amp;ldquo;cereologist&amp;rdquo;, Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978–1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;art-and-business&#34;&gt;Art and business &lt;a href=&#34;#art-and-business&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reports of simple circles in the 1970s, increasingly complex geometric designs have been created by anonymous artists, in some cases to attract tourists to an area. Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of its art practice and also for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set that was released on 7 September 1990, features an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. On the night of 11–12 July 1992, a crop-circle-making competition with a prize of £3,000 was held in Berkshire. In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own. In 2009, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts. A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A 3 ha (7 acres) crop circle depicting the emblem of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;legal-implications&#34;&gt;Legal implications &lt;a href=&#34;#legal-implications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1992, Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then aged 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle in Hungary. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-origin&#34;&gt;Human origin &lt;a href=&#34;#human-origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-origins&#34;&gt;Natural origins &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather &lt;a href=&#34;#weather&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes. In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm. In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;animal-activity&#34;&gt;Animal activity &lt;a href=&#34;#animal-activity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-explanations&#34;&gt;Alternative explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In science magazines from the 1980s and 1990s, one could read reports suggesting that the plants were bent by something that could be microwave radiation, rather than broken by physical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paranormal&#34;&gt;Paranormal &lt;a href=&#34;#paranormal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have been the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators, ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lightning and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Responding to local beliefs that &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial beings&amp;rdquo; in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &amp;ldquo;man-made&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes-to-crops&#34;&gt;Changes to crops &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-to-crops&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have claimed to observe differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;related-art&#34;&gt;Related art &lt;a href=&#34;#related-art&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow, by using skis, snow shoes or just walking with ordinary shoes. Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in sand. Images can be made in forests by cutting trees, especially in areas with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;folklore&#34;&gt;Folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Crop circles are culture dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularised Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they do not appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of &amp;ldquo;fairie rings&amp;rdquo;. A 17th-century English woodcut called the &lt;em&gt;Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt; depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. In the&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ancient-astronauts&#34;&gt;Ancient Astronauts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-astronauts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced the development of human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected modern cultures, technologies, religions, and human biology. A common idea is that deities from religions are extraterrestrial in origin, and advanced technologies were seen as divine by early humans. Academics and archaeologists dismiss these claims as pseudoarchaeological or unscientific, lacking credible peer-reviewed studies. Some argue that these theories have racist undertones, diminishing the accomplishments of indigenous cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI. Believers often claim that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence who landed on Earth in the past. They suggest that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these visitors, who acted as a &amp;ldquo;mother culture.&amp;rdquo; Proponents also claim that aliens built structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island or aided humans in their construction. Evidence is said to come from gaps in historical and archaeological records and artifacts that are considered anachronistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a pseudoarcheology, the idea is featured in fringe media, such as the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The show mixes fact with fiction to spread theories of an alternate past with tropes that follow white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents claim to be an oppressed minority of academics that &amp;lsquo;big archaeology&amp;rsquo; is conspiring to disenfranchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like archaeological endeavors of the criticized past, these proponents focus primarily on monumental archaeological structures claiming they could have only been constructed with extraterrestrial intervention. The implication is that the non-white Indigenous people in the regions in which these monuments appear could not have built them on their own. However, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer Ruth H. Burns counters that ancient alien theory and the idea of extraterrestrials in general supports the viewpoints of indigenous, non-European peoples. She believes the denial of extraterrestrial encounters and indigenous peoples’ stories tracing their origins to extraterrestrials is part of “Indigenous erasure,” as it minimizes or completely discounts the viewpoints of indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common feature in the stories portray the aliens as light-skinned or Aryan in complexion, as prominent alien astronaut proponent Erich von Däniken claims in his foundational work &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; Some ancient astronaut proponents are thus associated with white supremacism, although their theories are sometimes applied to European cultures as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These claims are so outlandish that up until recently, mainstream archaeologists essentially ignored them as absurdities. The few dedicated popular science explainers and skeptics who did offer opinions on the ideas universally panned them. Carl Sagan noted that cases of interest have reasonable alternative explanations or are misreported, fabricated, or distorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34;&gt;History of ancient aliens beliefs and their proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paleocontact narratives first appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt; (1898) and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It grew in popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and the success of Erich von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s works. Critics emerged throughout the 1970s, discrediting Von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s claims. Ufologists separated the idea from the UFO controversy. By the early 1980s little remaining support could be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shklovskii-and-sagan&#34;&gt;Shklovskii and Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#shklovskii-and-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan co-authored &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; with Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky in 1966. In &lt;em&gt;Broca&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1979), Sagan suggested that he and Shklovsky might have inspired the wave of 1970s ancient astronaut books, expressing disapproval of &amp;ldquo;von Däniken and other uncritical writers&amp;rdquo; who seemingly built on these ideas not as guarded speculations but as &amp;ldquo;valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact.&amp;rdquo; Sagan pointed out that many legends, artifacts, and purported out-of-place artifacts were cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses, &amp;ldquo;very few require more than passing mention&amp;rdquo; and could be easily explained with more conventional hypotheses. Sagan also reiterated his earlier conclusion that extraterrestrial visits to Earth were possible but unproven and improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;erich-von-däniken&#34;&gt;Erich von Däniken &lt;a href=&#34;#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erich von Däniken was a leading proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis in the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining a large audience through the 1968 publication of his best-selling book &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; and its sequels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to von Däniken, certain artifacts require more sophisticated technological ability in their construction than that which was available to the ancient cultures who constructed them. Von Däniken maintains that these artifacts were constructed either directly by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from said visitors. These include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken writes that ancient art and iconography throughout the world illustrates air and space vehicles, non-human but intelligent creatures, ancient astronauts, and artifacts of an anachronistically advanced technology. Von Däniken also states that geographically separated historical cultures share artistic themes, which he argues imply a common origin. One such example is von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the sarcophagus lid recovered from the tomb of the Classic-era Maya ruler of Palenque, Pacal the Great. Von Däniken writes that the design represented a seated astronaut. The iconography and accompanying Maya text, however, identifies it as a portrait of the ruler himself with the World Tree of Maya mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origins of many religions are interpreted by von Däniken as reactions to encounters with an alien race. According to his view, humans considered the technology of the aliens to be supernatural and the aliens themselves to be gods. Von Däniken states that the oral and written traditions of most religions contain references to alien visitors in the way of descriptions of stars and vehicular objects traveling through air and space. One such is Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s revelation, which Däniken interprets as a detailed description of a landing spacecraft (&lt;em&gt;The Spaceships of Ezekiel&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. after the NBC-TV documentary &lt;em&gt;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; hosted by Rod Serling, and the film &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, that many of his claims were unfounded, and that none of his core claims have been validated. In particular the Christian creationist community is highly critical of most of von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s work. Young Earth creationist author Clifford A. Wilson published &lt;em&gt;Crash Go the Chariots&lt;/em&gt; in 1972 in which he attempted to discredit all the claims made in &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt;, regarding the Nazca Lines, von Däniken states that &amp;ldquo;Seen from the air, the clear-cut impression that the 60 km [37-mile] long plain of Nazca made on me was that of an airfield.&amp;rdquo; Considering he was in the process of seeking evidence of ancient aliens, von Däniken exhibits confirmation bias, as he does not consider the Nazca Lines to be man-made until after the publication of &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; This etic perspective that he presents could be easily accepted by a reader familiar with air travel, and an undeveloped knowledge of the nature of the geoglyphs. Furthermore, since the majority of readers of &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; are not educated in viewing artifacts from ancient civilizations, their interpretations are highly subject to von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s opinions of the artifacts. Kenneth L. Feder argues a reader seeing the Nazca Lines for the first time in a book about aliens would be much more likely to associate those features with extraterrestrial origins, rather than from a civilization that existed on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, von Däniken admitted that the Nazca markings &amp;ldquo;could have been laid out on their gigantic scale by working from a model using a system of coordinates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s series &lt;em&gt;The Earth Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;, beginning with &lt;em&gt;The 12th Planet&lt;/em&gt;, revolves around Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s unique interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts from around the world. He hypothesizes that the gods of old Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet &amp;ldquo;Nibiru&amp;rdquo;, which Sitchin states the Sumerians believed to be a remote &amp;ldquo;12th planet&amp;rdquo; (counting the Sun, Moon, and Pluto as planets) associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin argues that there are Sumerian texts that tell the story that 50 Anunnaki, inhabitants of a planet named Nibiru, came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago with the intent of mining raw materials, especially gold, for transport back to Nibiru. With their small numbers they soon grew tired of the task and set out to genetically engineer&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be immediately identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and escalated during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained. Government investigations and studies by various organizations have occurred over the years, but without confirmation of claims that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence or other unconventional hypotheses. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes. The philosophical implications of UFOs relate to epistemology, dealing with temporarily or permanently unknowable anomalous phenomena. The U.S. government has two entities dedicated to UFO data collection and analysis: NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the Department of Defense&amp;rsquo;s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs,&amp;rdquo; originating from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to replace the misleading term &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has gained usage in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; UAP is sometimes expanded to &amp;ldquo;unidentified anomalous phenomenon.&amp;rdquo; In popular culture, UFO has become synonymous with alien spacecraft, sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena after careful investigation. Common identified sources include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. The USAF&amp;rsquo;s 1952–1955 study categorized UFOs as balloons, astronomical objects, aircraft, light phenomena, birds, clouds, dust, insufficient information, psychological manifestations, unknown, and other. Allan Hendry, a CUFOS researcher, found that fewer than one percent of cases were hoaxes, with most sightings being misidentifications of prosaic phenomena due to inexperience or misperception. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that thorough investigation often reveals less to the stories than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, planetary conjunctions, and optical phenomena. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet, first recorded by Chinese astronomers, was often seen as a supernatural portent or omen. Some UFO enthusiasts have drawn parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, but art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens, a Roman writer, documented wonders and portents in Rome between 249 and 12 BCE, with descriptions resembling meteor showers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo, a Song Chinese scholar-official, described a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in his &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt; (1088).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woodcut by Hans Glaser from 1561, known as the &amp;ldquo;celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg,&amp;rdquo; has been linked to ancient astronaut claims, though skeptics argue it depicts a sundog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A similar report from 1566 over Basel, along with other leaflets from the 15th and 16th centuries, described &amp;ldquo;miracles&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sky spectacles&amp;rdquo; resembling natural phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1878, farmer John Martin reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer, marking one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From November 1896 to April 1897, newspapers reported numerous sightings of &amp;ldquo;mystery airships,&amp;rdquo; with some people claiming to have spoken to the pilots. Thomas Edison dismissed these reports as fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings included St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire, the planet Venus, hallucinations, and German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, referred to as &amp;ldquo;Russian hail&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected, primarily by the Swedish military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science fiction depictions of spacecraft similar to flying saucers predated the first widely reported UFO sighting in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO craze began with the Kenneth Arnold sighting on June 24, 1947, when he described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; near Mount Rainier. Within weeks, reports of flying saucer sightings became common, including the Roswell incident in 1947. In 1950, influential books by Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, and Gerald Heard proposed the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media speculation ran rampant, especially during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. By 1953, intelligence officials worried that genuine incursions by enemy aircraft could be lost in a flood of UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force began investigating UFO reports through Project Sign, followed by Project Grudge and Project Blue Book. In the late 1950s, public pressure mounted for declassification of UFO records, but the CIA resisted. Official U.S. Air Force interest in UFO reports ended in 1969 after the Condon Report concluded that further investigation was not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became part of American popular culture&amp;rsquo;s obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. In 1961, the Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gained notoriety. In 1966, 5% of Americans reported seeing something they thought was a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention increased with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, funded from 2007 to 2012. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream attention to UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims more fully. In May 2022, the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee held congressional hearings on UAPs, the first public hearing on UFO sightings in the US in over 50 years. Another Congressional hearing took place on July 26, 2023, featuring the whistleblower claims of former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls have shown varying levels of belief in UFOs among Americans, with some indicating that a significant percentage believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFOs have been taken up by religious studies scholars, and popular culture has played a significant role in shaping public perception of extraterrestrials.&lt;/p&gt;

No official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known government studies include the Swedish military&amp;rsquo;s ghost rockets investigation (1946–1947), Project Blue Book by the USAF (1947–1969), Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948–1951), Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 by the Battelle Memorial Institute, and the Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Operação Prato (1977). France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN) since 1977, and Uruguay has had a similar investigation since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as physical spacecraft occupied by intelligent extraterrestrial organisms or probes designed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature back to the 1960s. Key figures mentioned include French ufologist Jacques Vallée, who used the term in his 1966 book, and French engineer Aimé Michel. James E. McDonald and James Harder also used the term in 1968, including during testimony before Congress. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; in 1969 when presenting the findings of the Condon Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical roots of the ETH, tracing it back to earlier concepts such as Percival Lowell&amp;rsquo;s ideas about Martian canals and civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups like NICAP and APRO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34;&gt;Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides examples of early speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a story from 1864 about American geologists discovering an alien-like creature inside an egg-shaped structure. It also discusses H. G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; and the &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; reported in the late 19th century, with some speculating they were from Mars. The section also notes the influence of comic strips, radio, and movie serials like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon on popularizing the idea of alien visitation in spaceships. The 1938 radio broadcast of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; by Orson Welles is mentioned as creating public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34;&gt;The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the events following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting of unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier in June 1947. It notes that Arnold quickly considered the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial. The section mentions the speculation in newspapers about the nature of the objects, including comments from U.S. Senator Glen Taylor and R. DeWitt Miller. It also references Charles Fort&amp;rsquo;s earlier documentation of unidentified flying objects. The section highlights that most people were initially unwilling to conclude the objects were extraterrestrial, with theories such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria being more popular. It cites a Gallup poll from August 1947 showing that most people either had no opinion or believed in a mundane explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-public-opinion&#34;&gt;Evolution of Public Opinion &lt;a href=&#34;#evolution-of-public-opinion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines how public opinion on UFOs and the ETH evolved. It mentions the release of several movies in the early 1950s depicting flying saucers and aliens. It cites a &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt; poll from 1951 indicating that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen man-made aircraft, while only a small percentage believed they had seen an alien craft. By 1957, a quarter of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A Roper poll in 2002 reported that a majority of respondents thought UFOs were real, with nearly half believing they had visited Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion&#34;&gt;Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society founded by George King in 1955 as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses NASA&amp;rsquo;s evolving stance on UAPs. It mentions that in June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP using scientific methods. Kopparapu presented a paper in August 2021 that supported ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-or-government-studies&#34;&gt;Private or Government Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#private-or-government-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details private and governmental studies that have supported the ETH or had members who dissented from official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Estimate of the Situation in 1948, which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation for unexplained cases, but was ordered destroyed. A secret West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s internal review of UFOs is mentioned, with some scientists considering the ETH. The section also notes individuals within Project Blue Book, such as Major Dewey Fournet and consultant J. Allen Hynek, who supported the ETH. Statements from former CIA Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter and Greek physicist Paul Santorini are included. The section also mentions the COMETA report, and Jean-Jacques Velasco&amp;rsquo;s book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34;&gt;Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It states that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien presence on Earth. It notes that no rigorous analysis has ever concluded that UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34;&gt;U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery &lt;a href=&#34;#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the U.S. military&amp;rsquo;s involvement in investigating and debunking UFOs. It mentions the Army Air Forces Intelligence&amp;rsquo;s secret study of saucer reports in 1947 and the formation of Project Sign. It notes that Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Scientific Investigation took interest in UFOs following the 1952 UFO flap. The Robertson Panel, organized by the CIA in 1953, reviewed Blue Book&amp;rsquo;s evidence and recommended a policy of public debunkery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;involvement-of-scientists&#34;&gt;Involvement of Scientists &lt;a href=&#34;#involvement-of-scientists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the scientific community&amp;rsquo;s lack of support for the ETH. It mentions Stephen Hawking&amp;rsquo;s skepticism and quotes Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s warning against self-deception in accepting or rejecting the idea of extraterrestrial visitation. It also quotes Peter A. Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s call for examining other possible theories beyond the ETH. The section presents the results of Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s polls of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and American Astronomical Society members, showing limited support for the ETH. It summarizes J. Allen Hynek&amp;rsquo;s seven key reasons for not accepting the ETH, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa-1&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section states NASA&amp;rsquo;s official position as of 2006, which is that the ETH lacks empirical evidence. It quotes David Morrison&amp;rsquo;s statements that no one has ever found a single artifact or convincing evidence for alien visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cia&#34;&gt;CIA &lt;a href=&#34;#cia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions the CIA&amp;rsquo;s organization of the Robertson Panel in 1953 to debunk the data collected by Project Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-white-house-position&#34;&gt;Official White House Position &lt;a href=&#34;#official-white-house-position&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents the White House&amp;rsquo;s official response in November 2011 to petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge alien visits and disclose any withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. The response states that the U.S. government has no evidence of life outside our planet or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Counter Critique of the Official Position: Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the concept of a conspiracy of silence or official cover-up to conceal information about UFOs. It mentions James Harder&amp;rsquo;s argument in 1968 that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs but had been suppressed. It cites a 1971 survey showing that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs than believed in the existence of UFOs or the ETH itself. It also mentions comments from former NASA astronauts Gordon Cooper and Brian O&amp;rsquo;Leary about NASA and the government suppressing UFO sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
