      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;mariana-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Mariana UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#mariana-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mariana UFO incident occurred in August 1950 in Great Falls, Montana. It involves a sighting filmed by local baseball coach Nick Mariana, considered among the first motion picture footage of a UFO. The U.S. Air Force initially claimed the objects were reflections of two F-94 jet fighters, a claim they later retracted and then endorsed again. Multiple investigations have yielded inconclusive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 15, 1950, at 11:29 am, Nick Mariana and his secretary, Virginia Raunig, spotted two bright, silvery objects rotating while flying over Great Falls at an estimated speed of 200 to 400 miles per hour. Mariana filmed the objects for sixteen seconds using his 16 mm movie camera. The &lt;em&gt;Great Falls Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reported the sighting the next day, and Mariana showed the film to local groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-investigation&#34;&gt;Air Force Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;em&gt;Great Falls Tribune&lt;/em&gt; informed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base about the sighting, Captain John P. Brynildsen interviewed Mariana and Raunig at Malmstrom AFB. Brynildsen sent the film to Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis. The Air Force initially determined the objects were reflections from two F-94 jet fighters. However, controversy arose when Mariana claimed the first thirty-five frames of his film, which clearly showed the UFOs as rotating disks, were missing. The Air Force denied removing more than a single damaged frame. Edward J. Ruppelt, who later headed Project Blue Book, noted the initial lack of Air Force interest in the UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lawsuit&#34;&gt;Lawsuit &lt;a href=&#34;#lawsuit&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1951, Bob Considine, a writer and UFO skeptic, wrote an article for &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/em&gt; debunking famous UFO sightings, including Mariana&amp;rsquo;s. Mariana filed a slander lawsuit against Considine, which was eventually dropped in September 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-studies&#34;&gt;Later Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#later-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 1952, Ruppelt convinced Mariana to allow the Air Force to reanalyze the film. Analysts at Wright-Patterson AFB ruled out birds, balloons, meteors, and reflections from F-94 jets. Ruppelt concluded the film showed an unknown object. In January 1953, the Robertson Panel, convened by the Air Force and CIA, judged the objects to be reflections of aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;baker-analysis&#34;&gt;Baker Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#baker-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1954, Greene-Rouse Productions hired Robert M.L. Baker, Jr. of Douglas Aircraft to analyze Mariana&amp;rsquo;s film for a documentary. Baker concluded that the jet reflection explanation was strained. In 1968, Baker testified before a Congressional hearing on UFOs, stating that his analysis excluded most natural phenomena. In 1969, at an AAAS UFO panel, Baker presented a paper concluding the Mariana film was unidentifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condon-report&#34;&gt;Condon Report &lt;a href=&#34;#condon-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, the U.S. government funded a study of the UFO phenomenon at the University of Colorado, chaired by Edward U. Condon. Roy Craig, a skeptical physicist, and David Saunders, a psychologist interested in the Mariana incident, reinvestigated the film. They disagreed on the film&amp;rsquo;s authenticity and the removal of frames. William Hartmann, an astronomer, analyzed the film and suggested airplanes remained the principal working hypothesis, though he acknowledged arguments against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of Mariana&amp;rsquo;s film are in the US National Archives. The film is featured in documentaries and online, and continues to be debated. Great Falls, Montana, has had over 100 UFO sightings since Mariana&amp;rsquo;s incident. In 2008, the minor league baseball team in Great Falls was renamed the Great Falls Voyagers in honor of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
