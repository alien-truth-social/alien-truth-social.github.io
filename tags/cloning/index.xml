&lt;p&gt;This entry provides a detailed overview of the 1997 science fiction horror film &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and written by Joss Whedon.

&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;rsquo;s story unfolds 200 years after &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt;. Military scientists aboard the USM &lt;em&gt;Auriga&lt;/em&gt; clone Ellen Ripley (Ripley 8) from pre-death blood samples to extract an Alien queen embryo. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it, and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. Ripley 8 possesses enhanced abilities due to the Xenomorph queen&amp;rsquo;s DNA. A group of mercenaries, including Elgyn, Johner, Christie, Vriess, Hillard, and Call, arrives on the &lt;em&gt;Auriga&lt;/em&gt; with abducted humans for use as Alien hosts.
