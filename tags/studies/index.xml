      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;identification-studies-of-ufos&#34;&gt;Identification studies of UFOs &lt;a href=&#34;#identification-studies-of-ufos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the challenges in identifying Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) due to the often poor quality of evidence and untrained observers. It notes that most investigated UFO sightings are eventually attributed to misidentified natural phenomena, aircraft, or other ordinary explanations. The term &amp;ldquo;identified flying objects&amp;rdquo; (IFOs) is used for UFOs that have been explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-studies&#34;&gt;UFO studies &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists major studies conducted over the past 70+ years concerning the identification of UFOs. Key studies mentioned include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Sign:&lt;/strong&gt; An early investigation into the credibility of UFO existence, considering factors like lift and propulsion methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14:&lt;/strong&gt; A statistical study by the Battelle Memorial Institute for the USAF, analyzing 3,200 UFO cases between 1952 and 1954. It found that 22% were unidentified, 69% were identified, and 9% had insufficient information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEPAN/SEPRA:&lt;/strong&gt; The official French government UFO investigation, which investigated about 6000 cases between 1977 and 2004. It found that 13% defied rational explanation, 46% were readily identifiable, and 41% lacked sufficient information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condon Committee:&lt;/strong&gt; An USAF-sponsored study that reported all 117 cases studied were or could probably be explained. A later review suggested 30% remained unexplained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICAP:&lt;/strong&gt; A civilian UFO organization that judged 16% of about 5,000 cases as unknowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pentagon UFO Report:&lt;/strong&gt; A United States federally mandated assessment summarizing information regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs), also known as unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAPs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allan Hendry&amp;rsquo;s study:&lt;/strong&gt; As chief investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), Hendry investigated 1,307 UFO reports and found that 89% were identifiable, 9% were unidentified, and only 1.5% were &amp;ldquo;hardcore&amp;rdquo; cases defying conventional explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-sign&#34;&gt;Project Sign &lt;a href=&#34;#project-sign&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s approach to investigating the credibility of UFOs, focusing on technical analysis of support (lift) and propulsion (thrust) methods. It lists various factors considered, such as wings, fuselage lift, rotor, vertical jet, Magnus effect, aerostatics, propeller engines, rockets, ramjets, and aerodynamic effects like the Katzmayer effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-blue-book-special-report-no-14&#34;&gt;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 &lt;a href=&#34;#project-blue-book-special-report-no-14&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14, which analyzed 3,201 reported UFO sightings between 1951 and 1954. Battelle analysts categorized cases into &amp;ldquo;knowns,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;unknowns,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;insufficient information,&amp;rdquo; further classifying them by quality. A case was deemed &amp;ldquo;identified&amp;rdquo; if two analysts agreed on a solution and &amp;ldquo;unidentified&amp;rdquo; if all four analysts agreed it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be matched to any known object or phenomenon. The study found 69% of cases to be identified, 22% unidentified, and 9% with insufficient information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;breakdown-by-category-of-ifo-and-case-quality&#34;&gt;Breakdown by category of IFO and case quality &lt;a href=&#34;#breakdown-by-category-of-ifo-and-case-quality&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents a table breaking down identified flying objects (IFOs) by category (Astronomical, Aircraft, Balloon, Light phenomena, Birds, Clouds, dust, etc., Psychological, Other) and case quality (Excellent, Good, Doubtful, Poor). It shows the percentage of each category within each quality level, providing insights into the types of misidentifications and their correlation with the quality of the reported sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;military-vs-civilian-breakdown&#34;&gt;Military vs. civilian breakdown &lt;a href=&#34;#military-vs-civilian-breakdown&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section compares the identification rates of UFOs reported by military personnel versus civilians, based on the quality of the reports. It shows that military witnesses tended to submit better quality reports, had fewer reports with insufficient information, and had higher percentages of unknowns compared to civilian reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;comparison-of-ifos-to-ufos-by-characteristics&#34;&gt;Comparison of IFOs to UFOs by characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#comparison-of-ifos-to-ufos-by-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses a statistical comparison between IFOs and UFOs based on characteristics like color, number of objects, shape, duration, speed, and brightness. The study aimed to determine if UFOs were simply misidentified IFOs or distinctly different phenomena. Initial results showed significant differences, but after removing &amp;ldquo;astronomical&amp;rdquo; sightings, only number and speed remained highly significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;allan-hendry-study&#34;&gt;Allan Hendry study &lt;a href=&#34;#allan-hendry-study&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details astronomer Allan Hendry&amp;rsquo;s investigation of 1,307 UFO reports. Hendry found that 88.6% of cases had prosaic explanations (IFOs), 8.6% were unknowns (UFOs), and 2.8% were &amp;ldquo;garbage&amp;rdquo; cases. Of the UFOs, 1.5% had no plausible explanation. He attributed most misidentifications to inexperience or misperception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;breakdown-of-cases&#34;&gt;Breakdown of cases &lt;a href=&#34;#breakdown-of-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents a detailed breakdown of Hendry&amp;rsquo;s case classifications, using a system developed by J. Allen Hynek. It categorizes cases by type (Nocturnal Lights, Daylight Discs, Radar/Visual, Close Encounters) and explanation (Astronomical, Aircraft, Balloons, Birds, Clouds, Light phenomena, Other). The table shows the number and percentage of cases falling into each category, providing a comprehensive overview of the types of phenomena commonly misidentified as UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;common-causes-of-misidentification-and-ufos&#34;&gt;Common causes of misidentification and UFOs &lt;a href=&#34;#common-causes-of-misidentification-and-ufos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores common objects and phenomena that are frequently misidentified as UFOs. It highlights that astronomical objects, aircraft, and balloons account for a large majority of identifiable UFO reports. Specific examples include bright stars and planets (especially Venus), meteors, hovering aircraft, and balloons. The section emphasizes that claims of misidentification are retrospective analyses and do not negate the experiences themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;venus&#34;&gt;Venus &lt;a href=&#34;#venus&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Venus as a common cause of UFO misidentification. It notes that Venus is the brightest object in the sky (excluding the Sun, Moon, and ISS) and can be easily mistaken for a UFO, especially by inexperienced observers or in unusual atmospheric conditions. Astronomer Phil Plait is mentioned as suggesting that Venus is responsible for the majority of all UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;meteors&#34;&gt;Meteors &lt;a href=&#34;#meteors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses meteors, particularly bright bolides, as a source of UFO sightings. It explains that bolides are long-lasting fireballs that can leave visible trails and be witnessed over large areas. People unfamiliar with meteors may mistake them for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;balloons-aircraft-satellites-and-other-man-made-objects&#34;&gt;Balloons, aircraft, satellites and other man-made objects &lt;a href=&#34;#balloons-aircraft-satellites-and-other-man-made-objects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers various man-made objects that are often misidentified as UFOs. It mentions Skyhook balloons, Project Loon test balloons, stealth aircraft, and drones as examples. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s report indicating that many UFO reports in the 1950s were classified aircraft like the SR-71 and U-2 is also noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lenticular-clouds&#34;&gt;Lenticular clouds &lt;a href=&#34;#lenticular-clouds&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section identifies lenticular clouds as a cause of UFO sightings due to their peculiar, lens-like shape. These stationary cloud formations often appear above mountains and can resemble &amp;ldquo;flying saucers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;misperception&#34;&gt;Misperception &lt;a href=&#34;#misperception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores how misperception can lead to UFO sightings. It discusses light distortion from air turbulence, the autokinetic effect (where stationary lights appear to move), and induced motion (where moving clouds create the illusion of object movement). It also notes that witnesses may underestimate distances to celestial objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fata-morgana&#34;&gt;Fata Morgana &lt;a href=&#34;#fata-morgana&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains Fata Morgana, a type of mirage, as a cause of UFO sightings. Fata Morgana can make objects below the horizon appear to be hovering in the sky, magnify images, and make them unrecognizable. It also mentions that Fata Morgana can affect radar, leading to radar mirages. The official UFO investigation in France, GEPAN/SEPRA, is cited regarding atmospheric ducting and radar mirages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;other-misidentifications&#34;&gt;Other misidentifications &lt;a href=&#34;#other-misidentifications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists other less common causes of UFO reports based on misidentification. These include birds, light phenomena (mirages, moondogs, sundogs, auroras, searchlights), and atmospheric phenomena (clouds, dust, fog, lenticular clouds, noctilucent clouds, rainbow effects, ice crystals). Other causes include kites, flares, reflections, and windborne debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;upper-atmospheric-lightning&#34;&gt;Upper atmospheric lightning &lt;a href=&#34;#upper-atmospheric-lightning&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces upper-atmospheric lightning phenomena like sprites, elves, and blue jets as potential explanations for some UFO sightings. Professor Colin Price of Tel Aviv University is mentioned as suggesting this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;electronic-warfare&#34;&gt;Electronic warfare &lt;a href=&#34;#electronic-warfare&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the potential for advanced electronic warfare (EW) techniques to deceive sensors and create false velocity and position information, leading to UFO sightings. Jeff Wise of &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; and David Hambling of &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; are cited regarding EW capabilities and laser technology that could produce &amp;ldquo;mid-air images.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;psychological&#34;&gt;Psychological &lt;a href=&#34;#psychological&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores psychological factors contributing to UFO sightings. Greg Eghigian of &lt;em&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine suggests that the nature of the UFO phenomenon evolves with technology. Sociologist David L. Miller notes that experts attribute many UFO sightings to social contagion or mass hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
