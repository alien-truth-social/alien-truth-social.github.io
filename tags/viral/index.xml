&lt;p&gt;Storm Area 51 was a Facebook event and internet meme that gained widespread attention in 2019. It centered around the idea of raiding Area 51, a highly classified United States Air Force facility, in search of extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area 51 is a United States Air Force facility within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It opened in 1955 and functioned as an aircraft testing and development facility during the Cold War. Due to its intense secrecy, Area 51 has become the subject of conspiracy theories regarding the presence of aliens. These theories began in the 1950s, with some individuals reporting UFO sightings at the base. Conspiracy theorists believe aliens, UFOs, or related information are stored at Area 51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-event-and-internet-meme&#34;&gt;Facebook event and Internet meme &lt;a href=&#34;#facebook-event-and-internet-meme&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matty Roberts, a Bakersfield resident and moderator of the Facebook page &lt;em&gt;Shitposting cause I&amp;rsquo;m in shambles&lt;/em&gt;, created the Storm Area 51 event. He devised the idea after watching Area 51 conspiracy theorist Bob Lazar and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell on &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; podcast. The event was planned to take place in Amargosa Valley on September 20, 2019. The Facebook event page included the phrase &amp;ldquo;If we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens.&amp;rdquo; The event quickly went viral, spreading to other social media platforms. The event received 2 million &amp;ldquo;going&amp;rdquo; and 1.5 million &amp;ldquo;interested&amp;rdquo; signatures. Rapper Lil Nas X released a music video for the remix of &amp;ldquo;Old Town Road&amp;rdquo; about the planned raid. Copycat events were also created, such as plans to storm a genealogical vault of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Loch Ness, the Bermuda Triangle, the US Capitol Building, and the Vatican City&amp;rsquo;s archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;response&#34;&gt;Response &lt;a href=&#34;#response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;national-government&#34;&gt;National government &lt;a href=&#34;#national-government&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated that officials were aware of the event and issued a warning against attempting to enter the area. The FBI also stated that they would be monitoring the situation. The FAA posted temporary flight restrictions, closing the airspace above two places nearby Area 51. The DVIDS made a Twitter post depicting military personnel and a B-2 stealth bomber with a controversial caption, which was later deleted, and an apology was issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;local-government&#34;&gt;Local government &lt;a href=&#34;#local-government&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln County officials drafted an emergency declaration and a plan to pool resources with neighboring counties, anticipating a large crowd. Concerns were raised about the limited number of hotel rooms, cellphone network capacity, and overcrowding at campsites, gas stations, and medical facilities. The town of Rachel posted a caution on its website, advising attendees to be experienced in desert survival and warning that the town would likely be unable to provide sufficient resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;businesses&#34;&gt;Businesses &lt;a href=&#34;#businesses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business owners in and around Rachel, Nevada, made preparations for visitors. Connie West, co-owner of the Little A&amp;rsquo;Le&amp;rsquo;Inn, booked all rooms and planned to open up camping space. Las Vegas businessman George Harris planned to hire bands for a festival called &amp;ldquo;The Swarm.&amp;rdquo; Other businesses around the U.S. based products and services on the event. Bud Light planned to release a promotional alien-themed beer label. Arby&amp;rsquo;s had planned to deliver food with a special menu to the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gathering-and-music-festivals&#34;&gt;Gathering and music festivals &lt;a href=&#34;#gathering-and-music-festivals&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the event was intended as comedic, some took it seriously and traveled to areas surrounding the facility. The Lincoln County Sheriff estimated that about 1,500 people showed up at the festivals, while about 150 people made the journey to the back gate of Area 51. One person attempted to enter the facility and received a warning, while six others were arrested for various offenses. Two people were injured in a rollover crash near Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two music festivals were announced: Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada, and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in Hiko, Nevada. Event creator Roberts pulled out of Alienstock 10 days before the festival, citing poor planning, and joined an alien-themed party in Las Vegas. Roberts&amp;rsquo;s lawyers sent a cease and desist regarding use of the name to Little A&amp;rsquo;Le&amp;rsquo;Inn owner Connie West, who continued with the name Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada. After the raid, the Area 51 Basecamp event was deemed a failure, while Alienstock was considered a success. The event&amp;rsquo;s aftermath saw several pending lawsuits surrounding the festival and Roberts&amp;rsquo;s call to breach the government facility.&lt;/p&gt;
