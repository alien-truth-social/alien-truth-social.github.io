      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and large, black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoids with grey skin, elongated bodies, small chests, and a lack of muscular definition. They are said to lack external human body parts like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their most striking feature is their disproportionately large heads with no hair and large, opaque, black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection further elaborates on the physical appearance of Grey aliens. They are generally depicted as lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from humans. The most prominent feature is their large, black, almond-shaped eyes, often described as lacking eye whites. They are also frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains the origin of the connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system. The association began with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and determined that the aliens&amp;rsquo; home was Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype. It notes that descriptions of beings similar to Greys predate alien encounter claims, citing H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; descriptions of future humans in &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; (1893) and the Eloi in &amp;ldquo;The Time Machine&amp;rdquo; (1895).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the literary and occult origins of the Grey alien concept. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; depictions of future humans and the Eloi are mentioned as early examples of beings with Grey-like characteristics. Aleister Crowley&amp;rsquo;s 1917 encounter with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, described as similar to a modern Grey, is also discussed. Gustav Sandgren&amp;rsquo;s 1933 science fiction novel, &lt;em&gt;Den okÃ¤nda faran&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;), which describes a race of extraterrestrials with grey skin, bald heads, and large eyes, is identified as a key influence on the modern image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case and its role in popularizing the Grey alien archetype. The Hills claimed that in 1961, they were abducted by grayish-skinned humanoid beings and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s 1990 article suggests that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which featured an alien with large eyes. Carl Sagan echoed these suspicions, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses how Grey aliens became an integral part of ufology and extraterrestrial-related folklore after the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter. Journalist C.D.B. Bryan notes that 73% of reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. The section also mentions the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, and claims that individuals saw the U.S. military handling child-sized beings with oversized heads and slanted eyes. Whitley Strieber&amp;rsquo;s 1987 book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, which described his alleged encounters with Greys, is also discussed. Jimmy Guieu&amp;rsquo;s 1988 interview on TF1&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ciel, mon mardi!&lt;/em&gt; introduced the term &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; to the French public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section further notes that Greys have become the subject of many conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of a government disinformation campaign or a product of mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s 1995 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to depict the autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection analyzes the role of Greys in alien abduction claims. It notes that Greys make up a significant percentage of reported alien encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focus of abduction claims, with abductees reporting that the Greys stare into their eyes during mental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents neurologist Steven Novella&amp;rsquo;s theory that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with their distinctive features representing traits associated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses Frederick V. Malmstrom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis,&amp;rdquo; which suggests that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom argues that the face of a Grey can be reconstructed through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face based on early-childhood sensation and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s argument that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection briefly mentions alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of alleged Grey aliens, including the interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the depiction of Grey aliens in popular culture. It notes that Greys have become a common way to depict extraterrestrials in fiction, supplanting the &amp;ldquo;little green men&amp;rdquo; archetype. Examples include Ultraman (1966), &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;. The section also mentions the increasing association of Greys with conspiracy theories in the 1990s, citing &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; as a prominent example. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The films &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; (2011) and &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; (2013) are also mentioned, as well as the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; (2021) and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt; (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulians, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin, lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition, and having disproportionately short legs. A key feature is their large heads relative to their bodies, devoid of hair, with small orifices for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their eyes are large, opaque, black, and almond-shaped. They are often described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system stems from Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and identified the stars as Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of beings resembling Grey aliens predate reported encounters. H.G. Wells described future humans with similar features in his 1893 article &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; and his 1895 novel &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. In 1917, Aleister Crowley described an entity named Lam with a similar appearance. In 1933, Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, described aliens with grey clothes, bald heads, and large eyes in his science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 brought the Grey alien archetype to public attention in 1965. The Hills claimed they were abducted by grey-skinned humanoids and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which aired shortly before Barney&amp;rsquo;s first hypnotic session. Carl Sagan also suggested &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as a potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter, Greys became a central figure in ufology and extraterrestrial folklore, particularly in the United States, where they account for 73% of reported alien encounters. The alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, was later linked to Greys. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, a book detailing his alleged encounters with Greys, which became a bestseller and was adapted into a film. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu introduced the term &amp;ldquo;les Petits-Gris&amp;rdquo; (little greys) to French audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys have become the subject of conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of government disinformation campaigns or mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage of an autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from Roswell, but later admitted it was a &amp;ldquo;reconstruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys are frequently associated with alien abduction claims, accounting for a significant percentage of reported encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focal point, with claims of inducing hallucinogenic states or emotions through staring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the presence of Grey aliens in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens have become a common depiction of extraterrestrials in fiction, replacing the earlier &amp;ldquo;little green men.&amp;rdquo; They have appeared in films and television shows such as &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;. During the 1990s, plotlines linking Greys to conspiracy theories became prevalent, as seen in &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The film &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; features a Grey alien who attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; presence in pop culture to government manipulation. The film &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; features child abduction by Greys. Greys also appear in the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
