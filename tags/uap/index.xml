      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufology&#34;&gt;Ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufology is the investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) by individuals who believe they may have extraordinary origins, often extraterrestrial. While governments, private groups, and fringe science may investigate UFOs, ufology is generally considered pseudoscience by skeptics and science educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology &lt;a href=&#34;#etymology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;ufology&amp;rdquo; is a neologism derived from &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; and the suffix &amp;ldquo;-logy.&amp;rdquo; Edward J. Ruppelt is credited with coining the term UFO. Early uses of &amp;ldquo;ufology&amp;rdquo; appeared in a 1957 &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Universe&lt;/em&gt; article and a 1958 presentation for The Planetary Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-background&#34;&gt;Historical background &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufology&amp;rsquo;s roots can be traced to several historical phenomena: the &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; of the late 1890s, &amp;ldquo;foo fighters&amp;rdquo; reported during World War II, &amp;ldquo;ghost fliers&amp;rdquo; of the 1930s, &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets&amp;rdquo; in Scandinavia in 1946, and the Kenneth Arnold &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; sighting in 1947. The Arnold sighting significantly popularized the concept of flying saucers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased UFO publicity after World War II coincided with the Cold War and concerns about Soviet aircraft. Official government activities related to ufology in the United States ended in the late 1960s after the Condon Committee report and the termination of Project Blue Book. Similar government-sponsored activities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden, also ended. France is an exception, maintaining the GEIPAN program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2023, NASA appointed Mark McInerney as the Director of U.A.P. to study such occurrences scientifically and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;as-a-field&#34;&gt;As a field &lt;a href=&#34;#as-a-field&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;status-as-a-pseudoscience&#34;&gt;Status as a pseudoscience &lt;a href=&#34;#status-as-a-pseudoscience&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufology is not recognized as a scientific field by academia and is generally considered a pseudoscience by skeptics and science educators. Pseudoscience lacks adherence to the scientific method, supporting evidence, plausibility, or falsifiability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social factors contribute to ufology&amp;rsquo;s status as a pseudoscience. Some argue that mistrust between ufology, the sciences, and government bodies contributes to this status. Poor science communication regarding the extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) hypothesis for UFOs hinders public understanding and discourages academic inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-interest&#34;&gt;Current interest &lt;a href=&#34;#current-interest&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Avi Loeb launched The Galileo Project to collect scientific evidence of extraterrestrials or their technology near Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of WÃ¼rzburg in Germany is developing sensors to detect and analyze aerial objects, potentially applicable to UAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 Gallup poll indicated an increase in the belief among Americans that some UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, NASA announced a study to establish a roadmap for investigating UAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the RAND Corporation published a study reviewing public reports of UAP sightings in the United States from 1998 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;methodological-issues&#34;&gt;Methodological issues &lt;a href=&#34;#methodological-issues&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific UFO research faces challenges due to the unpredictable nature of the phenomena, lack of reproducibility, and absence of tangible physicality. Most UFO sightings have mundane explanations, limiting the interpretive power of extraordinary events. Carl Sagan noted that reliable cases are uninteresting, and interesting cases are unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek and Jacques VallÃ©e developed descriptive systems for characterizing UFO sightings and organizing ufology investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phenomena-linked-to-ufology&#34;&gt;Phenomena linked to ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#phenomena-linked-to-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain phenomena are of interest to some ufologists, including crop circles, cattle mutilations, anomalous materials, alien abductions, and implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ufologists promote UFO conspiracy theories, including the Roswell Incident, Majestic 12 documents, and UFO disclosure advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Sheaffer has accused ufology of a &amp;ldquo;credulity explosion,&amp;rdquo; where increasingly outlandish stories gain traction. James E. McDonald identified &amp;ldquo;cultism&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;extreme subgroups&amp;rdquo; as negatively impacting ufology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-posadism&#34;&gt;In Posadism &lt;a href=&#34;#in-posadism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, ufology was synthesized with Posadism, a Trotskyist movement in South America. Juan Posadas, the main theorist, believed humanity should appeal to extraterrestrials to collaborate in suppressing poverty and creating a socialist system on Earth. This belief contributed to the decline of Posadism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;governmental-and-private-ufology-studies&#34;&gt;Governmental and private ufology studies &lt;a href=&#34;#governmental-and-private-ufology-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1940s, governmental agencies and private groups sponsored investigations, studies, and conferences related to ufology. These studies include Project Sign, Project Magnet, Project Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, and the Condon Committee in the United States; the Flying Saucer Working Party and Project Condign in Britain; GEIPAN in France; and Project Hessdalen in Norway. Private studies include those by the RAND Corporation, Harvey Rutledge of the University of Missouri, and the National Press Club&amp;rsquo;s Disclosure Project. The United Nations sponsored meetings and hearings concerning UFO sightings from 1977 to 1979. In August 2020, the United States Department of Defense established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to detect, analyze, and catalog unidentified aerial phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-organizations-and-events&#34;&gt;UFO organizations and events &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-organizations-and-events&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous private organizations worldwide are dedicated to the study, discussion, and publicity of ufology. Skeptic organizations emphasize the pseudoscientific nature of ufology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World UFO Day (July 2), ufologists raise public awareness of ufology, including group gatherings to search for and observe UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pentagon-ufo-videos&#34;&gt;Pentagon UFO Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#pentagon-ufo-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the widely publicized cockpit instrumentation display videos from US Navy fighter jets, often characterized as UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the videos, referencing historical UFO photographs and events. It details the initial incident on November 14, 2004, involving Commander David Fravor of the USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; Carrier Strike Group investigating radar indications of a possible target off the coast of southern California. The USS &lt;em&gt;Princeton&lt;/em&gt; had been tracking unusual aircraft for two weeks prior to the incident. Fravor&amp;rsquo;s account of encountering a white, oval object hovering above an ocean disturbance is highlighted, as well as the observations of other pilots. It also mentions Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, who recorded the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; video and coined the term &amp;ldquo;Tic Tac&amp;rdquo; to describe the object. The section also mentions the 2014-2015 incidents involving fighter pilots associated with the USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; carrier strike group operating off the East Coast of the United States, during which the GIMBAL and GOFAST videos were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-videos&#34;&gt;Release of Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the public release of the videos. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on the incidents and published the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL&amp;rdquo; videos in December 2017, while the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published the &amp;ldquo;GOFAST&amp;rdquo; video. Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, provided the videos to the press. Luis Elizondo, the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy. In September 2019, the Pentagon confirmed the videos were made by naval aviators. On April 27, 2020, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. In February 2020, the United States Navy confirmed that intelligence briefings have been provided to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021-release&#34;&gt;2021 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2021-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the release of additional footage in 2021. In April 2021, the Pentagon confirmed the authenticity of a video taken by Navy personnel aboard USS &lt;em&gt;Russell&lt;/em&gt; in 2019, showing a triangular object. Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acorn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metallic blimp&amp;rdquo;. In May 2021, a second video recorded by Navy personnel aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Omaha&lt;/em&gt; on July 15, 2019, was confirmed and is under review by the UAP Task Force. The video purportedly shows a spherical object flying over the ocean. Mick West commented on the video, suggesting it could simply be a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2023-release&#34;&gt;2023 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2023-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the release of additional videos in 2023. In early 2023, an object was filmed by two MQ-9 drones in South Asia, initially believed to be anomalous but later identified as a commuter aircraft. On May 31, 2023, Sean M. Kirkpatrick shared an infrared video recorded in the western United States in 2021, which AARO concluded to be commercial aircraft. On April 19, 2023, the Pentagon released another video featuring MQ-9 drone footage from the Middle East depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon resembling a small &amp;ldquo;metallic orb&amp;rdquo;. Sean M. Kirkpatrick briefed a Senate Armed Services subcommittee on the video, but stated they are unable to fully identify anything from the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-explanations&#34;&gt;Potential Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the aerial phenomena recorded in the videos. As of 2020, the Department of Defense characterizes the phenomena as &amp;ldquo;unidentified&amp;rdquo;. Skeptical explanations include instrument malfunction, human observational error, or common aircraft. Mick West cautioned that believers in &amp;ldquo;alien disclosure&amp;rdquo; are &amp;ldquo;encroaching on these real issues of UAPs&amp;rdquo;. Adam Frank speculated that the UFOs could be drones deployed by rivals like Russia and China. Thomas Bania speculated that they could be some form of electronic warfare fielded by China or Russia. The US Navy updated its reporting guidelines for unexplained aerial observations. Senator Marco Rubio expressed concern that the UFOs may be Chinese or Russian technology. Admiral Gary Roughead said that most assessments were inconclusive. Jeff Wise suggests advancements in electronic warfare could deceive sensors. In 2023, David Fravor testified under oath regarding the USS Nimitz sighting, stating that the technology was far superior to anything the US had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2021-ufo-report&#34;&gt;June 2021 UFO Report &lt;a href=&#34;#june-2021-ufo-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the preliminary report on UAPs released by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on June 25, 2021. The report came to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, citing a lack of sufficient data. Some UAPs appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics, including high velocity and maneuverability. The report indicated that the UAP recordings probably were of physical objects and proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; category. The report raised concerns about safety and security issues and indicated that investigation of the topic would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34;&gt;FOI Request by The Black Vault &lt;a href=&#34;#foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details a Freedom of Information request made by The Black Vault for the release of more video footage. The government confirmed it had more footage but refused to release it, citing concerns for national security. Gregory Cason stated that the release of this information would harm national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In Popular Culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes the videos&amp;rsquo; appearance in the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Unidentified: Inside America&amp;rsquo;s UFO Investigation&lt;/em&gt; and an interview with Fravor on &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pentagon-ufo-videos&#34;&gt;Pentagon UFO videos &lt;a href=&#34;#pentagon-ufo-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon UFO videos are visual recordings from United States Navy fighter jets, widely publicized as UFOs. These videos were recorded using forward-looking infrared (FLIR) targeting cameras from fighter jets based aboard the aircraft carriers USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; and USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; in 2004, 2014, and 2015. Additional footage was taken by other Navy personnel in 2019. The videos, characterized as officially documenting UFOs, have received extensive media coverage since 2017. The Pentagon officially released the first three videos of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in 2020 and confirmed the provenance of the leaked 2019 videos in 2021. Footage of UAPs was also released in 2023, sourced from MQ-9 military drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicity surrounding the videos has prompted explanations including drones or unidentified terrestrial aircraft, anomalous instrument readings, physical observational phenomena, human observational and interpretive error, and speculations of alien spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Pentagon UFO videos, referencing the broader history of UFO sightings and investigations. It mentions UFO photographs and links to other Wikipedia articles on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 14, 2004, Commander David Fravor of the USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; Carrier Strike Group investigated radar indications of a possible target off the coast of southern California. Fravor reported seeing a white, oval object hovering above an ocean disturbance. A second wave of fighters, including Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, recorded the FLIR video, with Underwood coining the term &amp;ldquo;Tic Tac&amp;rdquo; to describe the infrared image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2014â€“2015, fighter pilots associated with the USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; carrier strike group recorded the GIMBAL and GOFAST videos while operating off the East Coast of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-videos&#34;&gt;Release of videos &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the public release of the videos and the reactions that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 16, 2017, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on the incidents and published two videos, &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL.&amp;rdquo; The &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published a video titled &amp;ldquo;GOFAST.&amp;rdquo; The reports led to speculation by UFO investigators. Journalism professor Keith Kloor criticized the reporting as thinly-sourced and slanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos were initially provided to the press by Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. Luis Elizondo, the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2019, the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were made by naval aviators. On April 27, 2020, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. In February 2020, the United States Navy confirmed that intelligence briefings have been provided to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021-release&#34;&gt;2021 release &lt;a href=&#34;#2021-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the release of additional videos and images in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2021, the Pentagon confirmed that video footage of an unidentified triangular object taken by Navy personnel aboard USS &lt;em&gt;Russell&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 was authentic. Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acorn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metallic blimp&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes the release of additional footage in 2023, including analysis of the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, an object was filmed by two MQ-9 drones in South Asia. Initially believed to be anomalous, the object was later identified as a commuter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 31, 2023, Sean M. Kirkpatrick shared an infrared video recorded in the western United States in 2021, which the AARO concluded to be commercial aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 19, 2023, the Pentagon released another video featuring MQ-9 drone footage from the Middle East depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Sean M. Kirkpatrick briefed a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that it resembled a small &amp;ldquo;metallic orb&amp;rdquo; but said they are unable to fully identify anything from this video. Some skeptics suggested it might be a balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-explanations&#34;&gt;Potential explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses potential explanations for the aerial phenomena recorded in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2020, the Department of Defense characterizes the phenomena as &amp;ldquo;unidentified.&amp;rdquo; Widespread media attention has led to various theories, including pseudoscientific explanations such as ufology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptical explanations include instrument malfunction, human observational illusion, or common aircraft. Mick West cautioned that believers in &amp;ldquo;alien disclosure&amp;rdquo; are encroaching on real issues and that the recorded UFOs might be commercial airplanes or balloons distorted by infrared glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicist Adam Frank speculated that the UFOs could be drones deployed by rivals like Russia and China. Astronomer Thomas Bania speculated that they could be electronic warfare technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Navy updated its guidelines for reporting unexplained aerial observations. A spokesman suggested that the increase in reported intrusions could be due to the rise in availability of unmanned aerial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Marco Rubio expressed concern that the UFOs may be Chinese or Russian technology. Retired Admiral Gary Roughead said that most assessments were inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Dodd and security expert Jack Weinstein say that neither China nor Russia presently have the capability to produce aircraft with such extraordinary capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Wise suggested that advancements in electronic warfare techniques could deceive sensors, resulting in false velocity and position information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, David Fravor testified under oath that the technology they faced was far superior to anything they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2021-ufo-report&#34;&gt;June 2021 UFO report &lt;a href=&#34;#june-2021-ufo-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) preliminary report on UAPs released on June 25, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report came to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, citing a lack of sufficient data. In a limited number of incidents, UAP appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics. Some of the UAPs appeared to move with no discernible means of propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report indicated that, in most cases, the UAP recordings probably were of physical objects. The report proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report raised concerns about safety and security issues and indicated that investigation of the topic would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;preliminary-assessment-unidentified-aerial-phenomena&#34;&gt;Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena &lt;a href=&#34;#preliminary-assessment-unidentified-aerial-phenomena&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document summarizes the Wikipedia article on the &amp;ldquo;Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,&amp;rdquo; also known as the UAP Report or the Pentagon UFO Report, published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on June 25, 2021. It covers the background, content, and aftermath of the report, which assessed information regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), including unidentified flying objects (UFOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the events leading up to the report&amp;rsquo;s release. The Senate Intelligence Committee mandated the Director of National Intelligence to collaborate with the Secretary of Defense on a report detailing government knowledge of UAPs, commonly known as UFOs. This mandate was included in Senate Report 116-233 accompanying the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The report was to include detailed analysis of data and intelligence gathered by the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), and the FBI. It also required a description of an interagency process for data collection and analysis and identification of potential national security threats. The mandate followed articles confirming the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, a Department of Defense program that began in 2007. The Department of Defense released three videos recorded by US Navy pilots, known as the Pentagon UFO videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;report&#34;&gt;Report &lt;a href=&#34;#report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the content of the nine-page preliminary assessment released on June 25, 2021. The UAPTF focused on 144 observations of &amp;ldquo;unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; by the U.S. Armed Forces, mostly from U.S. Navy personnel, from 2004 to 2021. The report found that the UAPTF was unable to identify causes of the observations found in 143 reports, with only one identified as &amp;ldquo;a large, deflating balloon&amp;rdquo;. Eighteen incidents featured &amp;ldquo;unusual flight characteristics&amp;rdquo;. Some UAP released radio frequency energy picked up by U.S. military aircraft. The report did not link the sightings to extraterrestrial life. There were 11 reports of near misses between pilots and UAPs. The report established five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, U.S. government or American industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catch-all &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;classified-annex&#34;&gt;Classified Annex &lt;a href=&#34;#classified-annex&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the classified annex accompanying the public report. Lawmakers were given &amp;ldquo;little information beyond what&amp;rsquo;s publicly available&amp;rdquo; during the classified briefing, and the only videos shown had already been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;categories&#34;&gt;Categories &lt;a href=&#34;#categories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the five potential explanatory categories for UAPs observed between 2004 and 2021, as identified in the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airborne Clutter:&lt;/strong&gt; Objects like birds, balloons, or debris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Atmospheric Phenomena:&lt;/strong&gt; Ice crystals, moisture, and thermal fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USG or Industry Developmental Programs:&lt;/strong&gt; Developments and classified programs by U.S. entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Adversary Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Technologies deployed by China, Russia, or other nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other:&lt;/strong&gt; Unidentified UAP due to limited data or challenges in collection, processing, or analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reactions-and-aftermath&#34;&gt;Reactions and Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#reactions-and-aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the responses to the report. The report was largely considered inconclusive. The UAPTF announced efforts to acquire additional reporting and standardize incident reporting across US military services and government agencies. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks ordered the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s top intelligence and security official to establish a more formal means of coordinating the collection, reporting, and analysis of UAP information. Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio commented on the report, emphasizing the need to understand and mitigate threats to pilots and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;response-and-analysis&#34;&gt;Response and Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#response-and-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents various perspectives on the report and the broader topic of UFOs. Adam Mann of Wired magazine traces the current interest in UFOs back to To the Stars, which made the Pentagon UFO videos available to the New York Times. Jim Semivan and Tom DeLonge of To the Stars reject the idea that Russian or Chinese technology is responsible for UAP reports. Mick West argues that advocates of alien disclosure are mischaracterizing UAPs. Ravi Kumar Kopparapu suggests that making the data informing the report publicly available would be helpful. Kathryn Dorsch sees parallels with Cold War-era interest in UFOs. Jeff Wise speculates that advanced Electronic Warfare techniques could deceive sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section serves as an introduction to the topic, stating that the US government has been investigating UFOs since 1947 through various branches and agencies. It emphasizes that despite decades of interest, no evidence supports the extraordinary origins of UFOs, attributing sightings to natural phenomena, human technology, misapprehensions, delusions, or hoaxes. It mentions the initial Air Force projects (Sign, Grudge, Blue Book) and the Condon Report&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that further UFO study was not justified. It also highlights the 2017 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) and the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s release of UAP videos. Finally, it notes the establishment of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), congressional hearings on UAPs, NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP study team, and the creation of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-government-activity-from-1947-to-1969&#34;&gt;U.S. government activity from 1947 to 1969 &lt;a href=&#34;#us-government-activity-from-1947-to-1969&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the early period of US government UFO investigations, primarily through Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;projects-sign-grudge-and-blue-book&#34;&gt;Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book &lt;a href=&#34;#projects-sign-grudge-and-blue-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the three main Air Force projects dedicated to investigating UFOs during the specified time frame. It mentions Steven J. Dick&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s role in officially recognizing the extraterrestrial hypothesis. The section discusses the Mantell incident and the challenges the Air Force faced in quashing extraterrestrial rumors. It describes Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s initial extraterrestrial hypothesis, which was rejected by General Hoyt S. Vandenburg. It contrasts Project Sign with Project Grudge, which adopted a more skeptical approach. The section also highlights the role of J. Allen Hynek, who advocated for continued UFO studies. It provides statistics on the number of reported sightings investigated under these projects and the percentage that remained unidentified. It also mentions the CIA&amp;rsquo;s involvement and the Robertson Panel&amp;rsquo;s concerns about the sensationalization of UFO reports. Finally, it touches on Air Force Regulation 200-2, which governed the release of information about UFOs to the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condon-report-and-congressional-hearings&#34;&gt;Condon Report and Congressional hearings &lt;a href=&#34;#condon-report-and-congressional-hearings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the Condon Report&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that further UFO study was not justified and mentions the Congressional hearings held on the topic in 1966 and 1969.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides a summary of government activity during this period. It notes that most military and defense authorities concluded that UFOs posed no threat to national security, but investigations were shrouded in secrecy due to classified aviation projects. It contrasts the US approach with that of other governments, which have released formerly classified UFO documents. It also mentions J. Allen Hynek and Nick Pope as exceptions to the consensus against government investment in UFO investigations. Finally, it cites Robert Sheaffer&amp;rsquo;s assessment that Project Blue Book did not yield any significant findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-government-inactivity-from-1969-to-2017&#34;&gt;U.S. government inactivity from 1969 to 2017 &lt;a href=&#34;#us-government-inactivity-from-1969-to-2017&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the period of nearly five decades when the US government did not have public programs for investigating UFOs. It mentions a 1977 request from Frank Press to NASA to reopen investigations, and NASA&amp;rsquo;s initial inclination to agree, followed by a decision against establishing a research activity or convening a symposium on the subject. It also notes the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s release of two investigative reports on the Roswell incident in the 1990s due to renewed media interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-government-activity-from-2017-to-present&#34;&gt;U.S. government activity from 2017 to present &lt;a href=&#34;#us-government-activity-from-2017-to-present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the renewed interest and activity by the US government in UFO investigations starting in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;formation-of-uaptf-and-pentagon-release-of-uap-videos&#34;&gt;Formation of UAPTF and Pentagon release of UAP videos &lt;a href=&#34;#formation-of-uaptf-and-pentagon-release-of-uap-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the 2017 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report revealing the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) and the subsequent change in the conversation around UFOs. It mentions the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s release of UAP videos and the establishment of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF). It also notes Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s statement about unexplained objects in the skies and the release of the &amp;ldquo;Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena&amp;rdquo; report. It describes the May 17, 2022, congressional hearings on UAPs, where Pentagon officials reported a database of 400 UAP incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;formation-of-nasas-uap-study-team-and-the-pentagons-aaro&#34;&gt;Formation of NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP study team and the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s AARO &lt;a href=&#34;#formation-of-nasas-uap-study-team-and-the-pentagons-aaro&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the establishment of NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the replacement of the UAPTF with the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). It mentions Sean Kirkpatrick&amp;rsquo;s testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee and Avi Loeb&amp;rsquo;s critique of the testimony. It notes the first public meeting of the NASA team on May 31, 2023, and AARO&amp;rsquo;s ongoing investigation of over 800 UAP reports. It also discusses the July 26, 2023, Congressional hearing featuring testimony from David Grusch, Ryan Graves, and David Fravor, including Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims about a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program and the retrieval of &amp;ldquo;non-human&amp;rdquo; biological matter. Finally, it mentions the strengthening of UAP reporting requirements and the proposed legislation to create a commission for declassifying government UFO documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uap-disclosure-act&#34;&gt;UAP Disclosure Act &lt;a href=&#34;#uap-disclosure-act&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act (UAPDA), a series of bipartisan bills aimed at compelling the disclosure of UFO/UAP data, biological materials, and technologies originating from non-human extraterrestrial intelligence held by the US government and its contractors. It notes that the UAPDA was introduced as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs,&amp;rdquo; stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass the diverse range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has seen increased usage in the 21st century, partly to avoid the negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; In popular culture, &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; often implies an alien spacecraft, while the term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish this explanation from earthbound ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies indicate that most UFOs, upon thorough investigation, are identifiable as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft (military, civilian, experimental, drones), astronomical objects (bright stars, planets, meteors), balloons (weather, research, toy), hoaxes, light phenomena (mirages, flares, searchlights), other atmospheric objects (birds, unusual clouds, plasma), and psychological effects (pareidolia, hallucinations). Allan Hendry&amp;rsquo;s 1979 study found that fewer than 1% of investigated cases were hoaxes, with most sightings being misidentifications due to inexperience or misperception. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that increased investigation often reveals less mystery than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet, for example, was recorded by Chinese astronomers as early as 240 BC. Such events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes objects moving through the sky in ancient Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt; (1088), which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts from 1561 and 1566 depicting celestial phenomena over Nuremberg and Basel, respectively, which some connect to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An 1878 &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; article reporting John Martin&amp;rsquo;s sighting of a large, dark, circular object, one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous reports of &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; in United States newspapers from 1896 to 1897.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings ranged from St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire to German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, dubbed &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected, primarily by the Swedish military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s widely reported sighting in 1947, where he described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; near Mount Rainier. This event sparked a media frenzy and numerous subsequent sightings. Weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred, involving the recovery of a downed observation balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs&amp;rdquo; emerged, and influential books by Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, and Gerald Heard promoted the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis. Media speculation intensified, particularly during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force initiated investigations into UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings between 1952 and 1969. Public pressure for declassification of UFO records mounted, but the CIA resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into American popular culture, with the Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gaining notoriety. In 1966, a Gallup poll revealed that 5% of Americans claimed to have seen a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo; Despite efforts to debunk UFO claims, public fascination persisted, fueled by sci-fi films and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention surged following &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; report on the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos further heightened interest. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government-sponsored programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Harris Poll in 2009 indicated that 32% of Americans believed in UFOs. A 2021 Pew research poll found that 51% in the United States thought that UFOs reported by people in the military were likely to be evidence of intelligent life from beyond the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable cases and incidents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rendlesham Forest incident (1980).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; The Valensole UFO incident (1965) and the Trans-en-Provence Case (1981).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kecksburg UFO incident (1965), the Travis Walton abduction claim (1975), and the Phoenix Lights (1997).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous hoaxes include the Maury Island incident and the George Adamski claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UFO reports have been investigated by governments and academics in various countries. No official government investigation has definitively confirmed that UFOs are real, physical objects of extraterrestrial origin or a threat to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known government studies include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Swedish military&amp;rsquo;s ghost rockets investigation (1946â€“1947).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USAF&amp;rsquo;s Project Blue Book (1947â€“1969).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Army/Air Force Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948â€“1951).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s OperaÃ§Ã£o Prato (Operation Saucer) (1977).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France&amp;rsquo;s GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN investigation (1977â€“present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s government investigation (1989â€“present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;americas&#34;&gt;Americas &lt;a href=&#34;#americas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Archives of Brazil holds documentation from the Brazilian Air Force regarding UFO investigations between 1952 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;chile-c-1968&#34;&gt;Chile (c. 1968) &lt;a href=&#34;#chile-c-1968&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEFAA (previously CEFAA), a department of the DGAC, receives reports of UFO sightings from the public, civil aviators, and the Chilean Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;canada-c-1950&#34;&gt;Canada (c. 1950) &lt;a href=&#34;#canada-c-1950&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of National Defence has investigated UFO reports across Canada, including the Falcon Lake incident and the Shag Harbour UFO incident. Early Canadian studies included Project Magnet (1950â€“1954) and Project Second Storey (1952â€“1954).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;united-states&#34;&gt;United States &lt;a href=&#34;#united-states&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigations into UFOs include Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, the CIA&amp;rsquo;s DS&amp;amp;T study, the Robertson Panel, the Brookings Report, the Condon Committee, the RAND Corporation study, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Sturrock panel, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953â€“1954) defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and mandated its investigation as a potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Committee&amp;rsquo;s negative conclusion in 1968 led to the closure of Project Blue Book in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, the White House released an official response stating that the U.S. government has no evidence of&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; were initially used to describe UFOs, stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass a broader range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged later, gaining traction in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and earthbound explanations for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs, upon investigation, are identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. Studies have shown that misidentification of prosaic phenomena, often due to inexperience or misperception, is a primary factor in UFO sightings. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that thorough investigation often reveals less mystery than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and atmospheric optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians typically offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes objects moving through the sky in ancient Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts from the 16th century depicting celestial phenomena over Nuremberg and Basel, which some connect to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A report in the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in 1878, where a farmer described seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; In 1946, the Swedish military collected over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, referred to as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Arnold described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers,&amp;rdquo; sparking widespread public interest. Weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred, involving the recovery of debris from a downed observation balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs&amp;rdquo; emerged, and books like Donald Keyhoe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Flying Saucers Are Real&lt;/em&gt; popularized the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Media speculation intensified, particularly during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings. The Condon Report in 1968 concluded that further UFO studies were not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into popular culture, with alien abduction accounts like the Barney and Betty Hill incident gaining prominence. Films like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, along with TV series like &lt;em&gt;In Search of&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, fueled public fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention resurfaced with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream interest. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project, aiming to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government programs like NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were established to investigate UFO claims. Congressional hearings were held in 2022 and 2023, featuring whistleblower claims from former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls indicating that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s OperaÃ§Ã£o Prato (1977).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France&amp;rsquo;s GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN (1977â€“present).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil (1952â€“2016):&lt;/strong&gt; The National Archives of Brazil has been receiving documentation from the Brazilian Air Force regarding UFO investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chile (c. 1968):&lt;/strong&gt; The SEFAA (previously CEFAA) receives case reports from the public, civil aviators, and the Chilean Air Force.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s final report stated that there was not enough data to determine the origin of some UFOs. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate concluding an extraterrestrial origin, but the Air Force Chief of Staff ordered it destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classified U.S. study by the CIA in 1952 concluded that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge, which was later reorganized as Project Blue Book. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, became critical of the program&amp;rsquo;s scientific rigor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force Regulation 200-2 defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and outlined procedures for investigation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Condon Report in 1968 arrived at a negative conclusion regarding UFOs. Project Blue Book closed down in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II. Investigations by governments, organizations, and individuals have sought to understand these phenomena, but definitive confirmation of unconventional explanations remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UFOs are unexplained aerial objects or phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term UAP is increasingly used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most UFOs are identified as known objects or phenomena after investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small percentage remains unexplained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s following the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; for the USAF to encompass a broader range of reported shapes. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has gained usage in the 21st century. In popular culture, &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; often implies an alien spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flying saucer&amp;rdquo; was an early term for UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports of unusual aerial phenomena have existed throughout history. UFOs became a cultural phenomenon after World War II, with the Kenneth Arnold sighting in 1947 sparking widespread interest. Government investigations, such as Project Blue Book, were initiated to study UFO reports. The cultural phenomenon has inspired intellectual works, such as Carl Jung&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in UFOs, now often referred to as UAPs, with government-sponsored programs and increased media attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. Some UFO enthusiasts have drawn parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; In 1946, numerous reports of unidentified aerial objects over Scandinavia, known as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected. The modern UFO era began with the Kenneth Arnold sighting in 1947. The U.S. Air Force initiated Project Sign in 1947, followed by Project Grudge and Project Blue Book.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; were initially used to describe UFOs, stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass a broader range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged later, gaining traction in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and earthbound explanations for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs, upon investigation, are identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft (military, civilian, experimental, drones), astronomical objects (bright stars, planets, meteors), balloons (weather, research, toy), hoaxes, light phenomena (mirages, flares, searchlights), other atmospheric objects (birds, unusual clouds, plasma), and psychological effects (pareidolia, hallucinations). Studies, such as one by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry, have found that most sightings are honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena due to inexperience or misperception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes things moving through the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts and leaflets from the 15th and 16th centuries depicting &amp;ldquo;miracles&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sky spectacles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Martin&amp;rsquo;s 1878 report of a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying at high speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings ranged from St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire to German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects over Scandinavia, referred to as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with the widely reported sighting by Kenneth Arnold in 1947, who described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers.&amp;rdquo; This sparked a media frenzy and numerous reports of similar sightings, including the Roswell incident. UFO enthusiasts formed &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs,&amp;rdquo; and books promoting the extraterrestrial hypothesis gained popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., media accounts and speculation led to the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. From 1947 to 1969, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. The CIA also conducted a study in 1952, concluding that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat. Public pressure for declassification of UFO records mounted, but the CIA resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official U.S. Air Force interest waned after the Condon Report in 1969, which concluded that further study of UFOs was not justified. However, some government documents suggest that non-public UFO investigations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became part of popular culture&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the supernatural and paranormal. The Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gained notoriety, and UFO stories were featured in TV shows and films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention resurfaced with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream interest in UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government-sponsored programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims. Congressional hearings were held to discuss military reports of UAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls showing that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigations into UFOs include Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, the CIA&amp;rsquo;s Directorate of Science &amp;amp; Technology study, the Robertson Panel, the Brookings Report, the Condon Committee, the RAND Corporation study, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Sturrock panel, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force Regulation 200-2 (1953â€“1954) defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and outlined investigation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Committee&amp;rsquo;s negative conclusion in 1968 led to the closure of Project Blue Book in 1970. However, some documents suggest that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, the White House released an official response stating that the U.S. government has no evidence of extraterrestrial life or government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on UAPs, finding that the UAPTF was unable to identify 143 objects spotted between 2004 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uruguayan Air Force has conducted UFO investigations since 1989, analyzing approximately 2,100 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2007, the French space agency CNES published an archive of UFO sightings online. French studies include GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN, which has studied 6,000 cases, with about 22% remaining unexplained. In 2008, the Sigma Commission was created to investigate UFO phenomena worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alleged UFO sightings have gradually increased since the war, peaking in 1978 and 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NASA Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study Team (UAPIST) was a group of experts assembled by NASA to create a plan for analyzing unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;David Spergel, chair of NASA&amp;rsquo;s independent study on UAPs, answers a question during a public meeting of the team on May 31, 2023.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAPIST was officially created by Karen St. Germain, the director of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Earth Science Division, as a subcommittee of the Earth Science Advisory Committee (ESAC) on May 24, 2022. NASA appointed astrophysicist David Spergel as the chair of the team, and Daniel Evans as the official responsible for the study. The team&amp;rsquo;s goal was to gather data from various sources (civilians, government, non-profits, companies) to analyze UAPs. NASA emphasized openness and transparency, stating that findings would be shared publicly. The study was separate from the Department of Defense&amp;rsquo;s UAP efforts, although NASA coordinated with the government. In July 2022, the Department of Defense replaced the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group with the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). Further terms of reference were signed on May 18, 2023, extending the UAPIST and renaming it by changing &amp;ldquo;Aerial&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Anomalous&amp;rdquo;. Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Defense Department&amp;rsquo;s AARO, spoke at the first public meeting on May 31, 2023, emphasizing the complementary nature of NASA and AARO&amp;rsquo;s efforts. NASA focused on unclassified data, while AARO included classified material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uap-versus-ufo-terminology&#34;&gt;UAP versus UFO terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#uap-versus-ufo-terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term UAP emerged in the late 1960s, while &amp;ldquo;unidentified flying object&amp;rdquo; (UFO) dates back to 1947. UAP avoids the cultural associations with extraterrestrial life linked to UFOs. UFO has become associated with aliens, conspiracy theories, and religious movements. NASA updated the name of its independent study team at the start of 2023 from &amp;ldquo;unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;unidentified anomalous phenomena&amp;rdquo; to be consistent with the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;team-members&#34;&gt;Team members &lt;a href=&#34;#team-members&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA announced the UAP study team members on October 21, 2022. The team included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Spergel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anamaria Berea (George Mason University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federica Bianco (University of Delaware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paula Bontempi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reggie Brothers (AE Industrial Partners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jen Buss (Potomac Institute for Policy Studies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nadia Drake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Gold (Redwire)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Grinspoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Kelly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt Mountain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Randolph (FAA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walter Scott (Maxar Technologies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joshua Semeter (Boston University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karlin Toner (FAA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shelley Wright (University of California, San Diego)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Eghigian noted that the NASA study team represents a significant shift, with many academics now supporting scholarly research into UFOs. He highlighted that NASA&amp;rsquo;s involvement and the scientifically informed questions being asked are unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;team-member-commentary&#34;&gt;Team member commentary &lt;a href=&#34;#team-member-commentary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first public meeting on May 31, 2023, the NASA team addressed questions about UFOs. They emphasized collecting empirical data and improving UAP analysis. Spergel noted that many UAP events could be attributed to commercial aircraft, drones, balloons, weather, and ionospheric phenomena, but some events remain unexplained due to poor data quality. He cited fast radio bursts as an example of how anomalies can lead to novel physical phenomena. Regarding David Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims of a government coverup, Joshua Semeter stated that the NASA team is collaborating with the Defense Department&amp;rsquo;s AARO to determine the origin and nature of UAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-report&#34;&gt;Final report &lt;a href=&#34;#final-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent study team&amp;rsquo;s final report was published on September 14, 2023, along with the announcement of a director of UAP research at NASA. The report found no evidence of extraterrestrial life. The report stated that the lack of reproducible data makes it difficult to draw conclusions about some UAP origins. It recommended a rigorous, evidence-based approach to studying UAPs, including data collection methods using artificial intelligence and citizen observers. NASA was deemed well-positioned to lead this study. According to its 2023 terms of reference, the team was dissolved upon the completion and submission of its final report.&lt;/p&gt;
