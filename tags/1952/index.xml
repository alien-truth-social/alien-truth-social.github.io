      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;washington-dc-ufo-incident-1952&#34;&gt;Washington, D.C. UFO Incident (1952) &lt;a href=&#34;#washington-dc-ufo-incident-1952&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details a series of unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings that occurred in Washington, D.C., during July 1952. These sightings, known as the &amp;ldquo;Washington flap,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Washington National Airport Sightings,&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Invasion of Washington,&amp;rdquo; garnered significant media attention and became one of the most well-known UFO incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1952-ufo-flap&#34;&gt;1952 UFO flap &lt;a href=&#34;#1952-ufo-flap&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the broader context of the 1952 UFO flap, a period of heightened media and public interest in UFO sightings. It notes the surge in reported sightings during the summer of 1952, with the US Air Force receiving over 717 new reports, compared to 615 in the previous four years. It mentions the role of media coverage, including a &lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; magazine article titled &amp;ldquo;Have We Visitors From Space?&amp;rdquo; which is believed to have contributed to the increased sightings. The section also highlights other notable sightings and reports leading up to the Washington D.C. events, including a UFO report filed by Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles and an interception of a UFO over Boston by F-94s. The Nash-Fortenberry UFO sighting over Chesapeake Bay is also mentioned. Edward J. Ruppelt, the director of Project Blue Book, is a key figure mentioned in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings-over-washington-dc&#34;&gt;Sightings over Washington, D.C. &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings-over-washington-dc&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the specific UFO sightings that occurred over Washington, D.C., on two consecutive Saturday nights in July 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;night-of-july-19&#34;&gt;Night of July 19 &lt;a href=&#34;#night-of-july-19&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the events of the first night of sightings, beginning with air traffic controller Edward Nugent spotting seven objects on radar at Washington National Airport. Senior air-traffic controller Harry Barnes also witnessed the objects and noted their unusual movements. Controllers at the airport&amp;rsquo;s control tower, Howard Cocklin and Joe Zacko, also reported seeing unidentified blips on radar and a &amp;ldquo;bright light&amp;rdquo; in the sky. Airman William Brady at Andrews Air Force Base reported seeing an &amp;ldquo;orange ball of fire.&amp;rdquo; S.C. Pierman, a Capital Airlines pilot, observed six &amp;ldquo;white, tailless, fast-moving lights&amp;rdquo; near his plane. Staff Sgt. Charles Davenport at Andrews Air Force Base observed an orange-red light exhibiting unusual movements. Two F-94 Starfire jet fighters were dispatched from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware, but the objects vanished from radar upon their arrival, only to reappear after the jets left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;publicity-and-air-force-reaction&#34;&gt;Publicity and Air Force reaction &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-air-force-reaction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the widespread media coverage of the July 19-20 sightings, which made front-page headlines across the nation. It mentions the involvement of USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the supervisor of Project Blue Book, who was in Washington at the time but faced difficulties in investigating the sightings. The section also notes that an Air Force radar specialist, Captain Roy James, suggested that unusual weather conditions could have caused the radar targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;night-of-july-26&#34;&gt;Night of July 26 &lt;a href=&#34;#night-of-july-26&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection describes the events of the second night of sightings, beginning with a pilot and stewardess on a National Airlines flight reporting lights above their plane. Radar centers at National Airport and Andrews AFB tracked more unknown objects. USAF master sergeant Charles E. Cummings visually observed the objects at Andrews. Albert M. Chop, the press spokesman for Project Blue Book, arrived at National Airport. Two F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base were scrambled. Captain John McHugo, the flight leader, saw nothing, but his wingman, Lieutenant William Patterson, saw four white &amp;ldquo;glows&amp;rdquo; and chased them. USAF Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Book&amp;rsquo;s liaison at the Pentagon, and Lt. John Holcomb, a United States Navy radar specialist, arrived at the radar center at National Airport. Civilian aircraft also reported glowing objects that corresponded to radar blips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions a report from West Palm Beach scoutmaster Sonny DesVergers, who claimed to have been burned by a flying disc on August 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-explanation&#34;&gt;Air Force explanation &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-explanation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s official explanation for the sightings. Major Generals John Samford, USAF Director of Intelligence, and Roger M. Ramey, USAF Director of Operations, held a press conference at the Pentagon on July 29, 1952. Samford stated that the visual sightings could be explained as misidentified aerial phenomena, such as stars or meteors, and the unknown radar targets could be attributed to temperature inversion. The crew of a B-25 bomber and Air Force Captain Harold May are mentioned as witnesses who supported the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation. The CAA&amp;rsquo;s Technical Development and Evaluation Center also conducted an analysis that supported the temperature inversion theory. Donald Menzel and Philip Klass are mentioned as prominent UFO skeptics who also supported the temperature inversion/mirage hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;criticisms&#34;&gt;Criticisms &lt;a href=&#34;#criticisms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents criticisms of the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation. Edward J. Ruppelt, in his book, noted that radar and control tower personnel, as well as some Air Force officers, disagreed with the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation. Michael Wertheimer, a researcher for the Condon Report, stated that radar witnesses still disputed the Air Force explanation in 1966. Former radar controller Howard Cocklin maintained his belief that he saw an object over Washington National Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;white-house-concern-and-cia-interest&#34;&gt;White House concern and CIA interest &lt;a href=&#34;#white-house-concern-and-cia-interest&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the concern that the sightings caused within the White House and the CIA. President Harry Truman requested an explanation of the sightings and radar returns. CIA historian Gerald Haines noted that the Truman administration was alarmed by the sightings. The CIA formed a special study group to review the situation and recommended continued monitoring of the problem. This concern led to the creation of the Robertson Panel in January 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-robertson-panel&#34;&gt;The Robertson Panel &lt;a href=&#34;#the-robertson-panel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the creation and findings of the Robertson Panel, formed in January 1953 due to the high number of UFO reports. The panel, chaired by physicist Howard P. Robertson, consisted of prominent scientists who examined UFO cases collected by Project Blue Book. The panel dismissed most cases as not representing anything unusual or threatening and recommended that the Air Force and Project Blue Book focus on debunking UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes the appearances of the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident in popular culture, specifically in the History Channel television series &lt;em&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/em&gt; and the Netflix series &lt;em&gt;Top Secret UFO Projects Declassified&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
