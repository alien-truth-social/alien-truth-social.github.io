      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pentagon-ufo-videos&#34;&gt;Pentagon UFO Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#pentagon-ufo-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the series of videos recorded by US Navy fighter jets that have been widely publicized as documenting UFOs. These videos, taken from cockpit instrumentation displays, show unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and have garnered significant media attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the videos, referencing earlier UFO photographs and the history of UFO investigations by the US government. It details the initial incident on November 14, 2004, when Commander David Fravor of the USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; Carrier Strike Group investigated radar indications of a possible target off the coast of southern California. The USS &lt;em&gt;Princeton&lt;/em&gt; had been tracking unusual aircraft for two weeks prior to the incident. Fravor reported seeing a white, oval object hovering above an ocean disturbance. Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, equipped with an advanced infrared camera (FLIR), recorded the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; video and coined the term &amp;ldquo;Tic Tac&amp;rdquo; to describe the object. The section also mentions the 2014-2015 recordings made by fighter pilots associated with the USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; carrier strike group off the East Coast of the United States, which resulted in the &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GOFAST&amp;rdquo; videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-videos&#34;&gt;Release of Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines how the videos became public. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on the incidents and published the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL&amp;rdquo; videos on December 16, 2017. The &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published the &amp;ldquo;GOFAST&amp;rdquo; video. Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, provided the videos to the press. Luis Elizondo, the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy. The Pentagon formally released the three videos on April 27, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021-release&#34;&gt;2021 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2021-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the release of additional footage in 2021. In April 2021, the Pentagon confirmed the authenticity of a video taken by Navy personnel aboard USS &lt;em&gt;Russell&lt;/em&gt; in 2019, showing what appeared to be an unidentified triangular object. Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acorn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metallic blimp&amp;rdquo;. In May 2021, a video recorded on July 15, 2019, aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Omaha&lt;/em&gt;, purportedly showing a spherical object flying over the ocean, was also confirmed. Mick West commented that the object in the video moved and acted like a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2023-release&#34;&gt;2023 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2023-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the release of UAP footage from MQ-9 drones in early 2023. One video, filmed in South Asia, initially appeared &amp;ldquo;truly anomalous&amp;rdquo; but was later identified as a commuter aircraft. Another video from the Western United States in 2021 was identified as commercial aircraft by the AARO. In April 2023, the Pentagon released a video featuring MQ-9 drone footage from the Middle East depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon resembling a small &amp;ldquo;metallic orb&amp;rdquo;. Sean M. Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, briefed a Senate Armed Services subcommittee on the video but stated that they were unable to fully identify anything from the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-explanations&#34;&gt;Potential Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores various explanations for the aerial phenomena. The Department of Defense characterizes the recorded events as &amp;ldquo;unidentified&amp;rdquo;. Explanations range from instrument malfunction and human observational error to common aircraft or aerial devices. Skeptical explanations include instrument or software malfunction, anomaly or artifact, human observational illusion, or common aircraft. Adam Frank speculated that the UFOs could be drones deployed by rivals like Russia and China. Marco Rubio expressed concern that the UFOs may be Chinese or Russian technology. Jeff Wise suggests that advancements in electronic warfare could deceive sensors, resulting in false velocity and position information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2021-ufo-report&#34;&gt;June 2021 UFO Report &lt;a href=&#34;#june-2021-ufo-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) preliminary report on UAPs, released on June 25, 2021. The report came to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, citing a lack of sufficient data. Some UAPs appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics, including high velocity, breaking the sound barrier without producing a sonic boom, high maneuverability, long-duration flight, and an ability to submerge into the water. The report indicated that the UAPs could be a safety issue and pose a security threat. It proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34;&gt;FOI Request by The Black Vault &lt;a href=&#34;#foi-request-by-the-black-vault&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses a Freedom of Information request made by The Black Vault for the release of more video footage. The government confirmed it had more footage but refused to release it, citing concerns for national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In Popular Culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes the videos&amp;rsquo; appearances in the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Unidentified: Inside America&amp;rsquo;s UFO Investigation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, where Fravor was interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
