      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no such life has been conclusively detected, the possibility ranges from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The science dedicated to studying extraterrestrial life is astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a framework for understanding the topic of extraterrestrial life within the broader context of life in the universe. It outlines related topics such as planetary habitability within and outside the Solar System, including specific locations like Venus, Mars, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. It also touches on the habitability of various star systems, including binary star systems, those with natural satellites, neutron stars, red dwarfs, K-type main-sequence stars, yellow dwarfs, and F-type main-sequence stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the debate surrounding the prevalence of life in the cosmos. It presents the argument for ubiquitous extraterrestrial life, emphasizing the size and age of the universe, the commonality of life&amp;rsquo;s building blocks, and the universality of physical laws. Scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view, which aligns with the Copernican and mediocrity principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposing view, the Rare Earth hypothesis, suggests that life, especially complex life, may be rare due to a unique combination of factors specific to Earth. The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic tool for estimating the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. However, its controversial nature is highlighted due to the speculative nature of its variables. The Fermi paradox, the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for them, is also mentioned. Dennis W. Sciama, Zhi-Wei Wang, and Samuel L. Braunstein are mentioned in relation to the Fermi Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section delves into the potential biochemical makeup of extraterrestrial life. It acknowledges the possibility of diverse life forms, from microorganisms to intelligent beings, and uses Earth&amp;rsquo;s life as a reference point. The section discusses the requirements for life, including non-equilibrium thermodynamics and a source of energy, such as stars, volcanoes, or hydrothermal vents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of a liquid solvent, particularly water, for biochemical reactions is emphasized, while also considering alternatives like ammonia or liquid hydrocarbons. The section explores potential alternative chemical elements for life, focusing on carbon and its possible replacements like silicon.

&lt;p&gt;This section assesses the potential for life on various bodies within our Solar System. Besides Earth, Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most promising candidates. Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that took a different evolutionary path. Mars is considered a possibility due to past water abundance. The gas and ice giants are deemed unlikely to host life, but their moons are of interest. Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are mentioned as having subsurface oceans, with Europa being the most promising due to its ocean&amp;rsquo;s contact with the rocky surface. Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, is highlighted for its eruption columns that release water into space. Titan, another moon of Saturn, is noted for having liquid bodies on its surface composed of hydrocarbons. Mary Voytek is mentioned as an astrobiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-search&#34;&gt;Scientific Search &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-search&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the scientific approach to searching for extraterrestrial life, primarily through astrobiology. It emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the field, encompassing astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric sciences. The search is conducted both directly, by looking for biosignatures, and indirectly, by searching for habitable exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-basic-life&#34;&gt;Search for Basic Life &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-basic-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-tv-program&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial (TV program) &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-tv-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry details a British-American two-part television documentary miniseries, also known as &lt;em&gt;Alien Worlds&lt;/em&gt; in the UK, which aired in 2005. The program, produced by Big Wave Productions Ltd., explores the hypothetical evolution of alien life on extrasolar planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;series-concept-and-scientific-basis&#34;&gt;Series concept and scientific basis &lt;a href=&#34;#series-concept-and-scientific-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary speculates about life on extrasolar planets, prompted by the discovery of such planets starting in 1989. It highlights the importance of the habitable zone, where temperatures allow liquid water to exist. The program mentions exoplanets Gliese 667 Cc and Gliese 581g (disputed) as examples, noting the challenges in detecting smaller, terrestrial planets. The cancellation of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) project is discussed, along with the shift in focus towards red dwarf stars and binary systems as potential locations for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-1-aurelia&#34;&gt;Episode 1: Aurelia &lt;a href=&#34;#episode-1-aurelia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode focuses on Aurelia, a hypothetical Earth-sized extrasolar planet orbiting a red dwarf star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;planetary-concept&#34;&gt;Planetary concept &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-concept&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists theorize that red dwarf stars, despite being dimmer, offer long lifespans suitable for life evolution. The close proximity required for habitability around a red dwarf would likely result in tidal locking. The program challenges traditional assumptions about tidally locked planets, suggesting they can retain an atmosphere, albeit with unusual characteristics. Aurelia would lack seasons and a day/night cycle, with one side in perpetual darkness and the other experiencing a constant hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifeforms-of-aurelia&#34;&gt;Lifeforms of Aurelia &lt;a href=&#34;#lifeforms-of-aurelia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode speculates on potential lifeforms, assuming carbon-based biology. A plant-like creature called a Stinger Fan is presented as the primary autotroph, with six-legged, beaver-like Mudpods feeding on them. Gulphogs, large, emu-like predators, hunt the Mudpods. Hysteria, tiny, orange creatures similar to tadpoles and piranhas, can form super-organisms to paralyze and consume other animals. All organisms have adaptations to detect and avoid deadly solar flares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-2-blue-moon&#34;&gt;Episode 2: Blue Moon &lt;a href=&#34;#episode-2-blue-moon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode explores the Blue Moon, a fictional moon orbiting a gas giant in a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;planetary-concept-1&#34;&gt;Planetary concept &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-concept-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Moon is covered in water and has a dense atmosphere, allowing for the evolution of enormous flying creatures. It orbits a Water Cloud Jovian planet in a binary star system. The moon&amp;rsquo;s thick atmosphere maintains constant temperatures, and a greenish haze is present due to floating moss and algae. The denser atmosphere allows for massive airborne creatures like Skywhales, which evolved from sea-going animals. High oxygen levels (30%) create a risk of spontaneous combustion during lightning storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifeforms-of-the-blue-moon&#34;&gt;Lifeforms of the Blue Moon &lt;a href=&#34;#lifeforms-of-the-blue-moon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skywhales are preyed upon by insect-like Caped Stalkers, colony-living predators with specialized tasks. Giant Kites, parasol-like grazers, also inhabit the skies. The land is dominated by pagoda trees and balloon plants. The pagoda trees interconnect to reach great heights, collecting rainwater in their hollow leaves. Balloon plants release hydrogen-filled seeds for dispersal. The forest floor features a bioluminescent ecosystem with fungi and other creatures. Mass wildfires pose a threat to the Blue Moon&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem, with balloon plants exploding and releasing seeds during fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-video-releases&#34;&gt;Home video releases &lt;a href=&#34;#home-video-releases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel 4 released a DVD of the documentary in January 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
