      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;chicago-ohare-ufo-sighting&#34;&gt;Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare UFO Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#chicago-ohare-ufo-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This details a supposed paranormal event that occurred on November 7, 2006, around 4:15 p.m. at O&amp;rsquo;Hare International Airport. Twelve United Airlines employees and other witnesses reported seeing a UFO. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) dismissed the incident as a &amp;ldquo;weather phenomenon&amp;rdquo; due to the object not being detected on radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sighting&#34;&gt;The Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#the-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7, 2006, at approximately 4:15 PM CST, a group of twelve airport employees at Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare International Airport reported witnessing a metallic, saucer-shaped craft hovering over Gate C-17. A ramp employee first spotted the object while pushing back United Airlines Flight 446, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina. The employee alerted the flight crew. Pilots, airline management, and mechanics also witnessed the object. Air traffic controllers did not see the object, and it did not appear on radar. Witnesses described the object as silent, dark gray, and ranging from 6 to 24 feet in diameter. Independent witnesses outside the airport also reported seeing the object. One witness described a disc-shaped craft hovering over the airport that shot through the clouds at high velocity, leaving a clear blue hole. Eyewitness accounts varied regarding the shape, height, movement, time, and number of objects sighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reaction-from-the-federal-aviation-administration-and-united-airlines&#34;&gt;Reaction from the Federal Aviation Administration and United Airlines &lt;a href=&#34;#reaction-from-the-federal-aviation-administration-and-united-airlines&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, both United Airlines and the FAA denied having information about the sighting. The &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, prompting the FAA to conduct an internal review of air-traffic communications tapes. The review uncovered a call from a United supervisor to an FAA manager in the airport tower regarding the UFO sighting. The FAA concluded that the sighting was due to a &amp;ldquo;weather phenomenon&amp;rdquo; and would not investigate further. Astronomer Mark Hammergren suggested that weather conditions were conducive to a &amp;ldquo;hole-punch cloud.&amp;rdquo; UFO investigators argued that the FAA&amp;rsquo;s refusal to investigate contradicted its mandate to investigate potential security breaches at airports. Some witnesses expressed frustration that federal officials declined to investigate the matter further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare airport UFO story received coverage from major media outlets, including CNN, CBS, MSNBC, Fox News, the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, and NPR. The History Channel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; reviewed the incident in an episode titled &amp;ldquo;Aliens at the Airport&amp;rdquo; on February 11, 2009. The incident is also featured in &lt;em&gt;Hangar 1: The UFO Files&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; and an episode of &lt;em&gt;Boston Legal&lt;/em&gt; reference the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dover Demon</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_670cdf070164/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dover-demon&#34;&gt;Dover Demon &lt;a href=&#34;#dover-demon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dover Demon is a creature reportedly sighted in Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the reported sightings of the Dover Demon in April 1977. William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Bartlett, John Baxter, and Abby Brabham, all teenagers at the time, independently reported seeing a strange creature. Bartlett described it as about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth, with a watermelon-shaped head. Baxter reported a similar sighting on Miller Hill Road, and Brabham claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue. The teenagers drew sketches of the creature, with Bartlett swearing on a stack of Bibles to the accuracy of his drawing. The locations of the sightings, when plotted on a map, formed a straight line over 2 miles. The sightings became public in May, and a local investigator noted similarities to the creatures in the Kellyâ€“Hopkinsville encounter. The Mutual UFO Network also investigated the sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-explanations&#34;&gt;Possible explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the Dover Demon sightings. One suggestion is that the creature was a foal or a moose calf. Skeptic Joe Nickell proposes that the creature was likely a snowy owl, citing its size and plumage, which could reflect yellow headlights. The &amp;ldquo;long spindly arms&amp;rdquo; could be the partially opened wings of the owl. Police suggested the sightings were a school vacation hoax. Ben Radford suggests the sightings may have been influenced by the release of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the Dover Demon&amp;rsquo;s appearances in popular culture. It was featured in an episode of the American horror television series &lt;em&gt;Lost Tapes&lt;/em&gt; on Animal Planet in 2009. The Dover Demon appears as a character in the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;, where it can see into the future, and in &lt;em&gt;The Perhapanauts&lt;/em&gt;. It also made appearances in &lt;em&gt;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&lt;/em&gt;. A Dover Demon appears in the webcomic &lt;em&gt;Gunnerkrigg Court&lt;/em&gt;. In the manga series &lt;em&gt;Dandadan&lt;/em&gt;, an alien known as Dover Demon takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pascagoula Abduction</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pascagoula-abduction&#34;&gt;Pascagoula Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#pascagoula-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pascagoula Abduction refers to an alleged UFO sighting and alien abduction that occurred in 1973. Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed to have been abducted and examined by extraterrestrial beings while fishing near the Pascagoula River in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alleged-abduction&#34;&gt;Alleged abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alleged-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of October 11, 1973, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker reported to the Jackson County, Mississippi, sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office that they experienced an unusual event while fishing on a pier along the Pascagoula River. They described hearing a strange whirring sound and seeing flashing blue lights, followed by the appearance of an oval-shaped object. Hickson and Parker claimed they were paralyzed and then taken aboard the object by three creatures with robotic features and crab-like pincers, where they underwent an examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publicity-and-later-activities&#34;&gt;Publicity and later activities &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-later-activities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, Charles Hickson engaged in interviews, lectures, and television appearances, including an episode of &lt;em&gt;To Tell The Truth&lt;/em&gt;. He also claimed additional encounters with aliens and authored a book titled &lt;em&gt;UFO Contact at Pascagoula&lt;/em&gt;. Calvin Parker attended UFO conventions and started a company called &amp;ldquo;UFO Investigations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Hickson died in September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Calvin Parker released his own book, &lt;em&gt;Pascagoula: The Closest Encounter, My Story&lt;/em&gt;, providing his full account of the event and its impact on his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, a historical marker was unveiled at the site of the alleged abduction. Calvin Parker, along with Hickson&amp;rsquo;s son and family, attended the unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin Parker died in August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skepticism&#34;&gt;Skepticism &lt;a href=&#34;#skepticism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aviation journalist and UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass found discrepancies in Hickson&amp;rsquo;s story and noted his refusal to take a polygraph exam. Klass concluded that the case was a hoax. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell questioned Hickson&amp;rsquo;s behavior and suggested that the alien encounter may have been a hypnagogic &amp;ldquo;waking dream state.&amp;rdquo; Nickell also suggested that Parker&amp;rsquo;s corroboration was due to suggestibility, as he initially claimed to have passed out during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
