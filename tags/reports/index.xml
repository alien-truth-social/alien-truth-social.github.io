      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-ufo-sightings-in-the-czech-republic&#34;&gt;List of UFO Sightings in the Czech Republic &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-ufo-sightings-in-the-czech-republic&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article documents alleged UFO sightings in the Czech Republic, spanning from 1976 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1976-radkov&#34;&gt;1976, Radkov &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-radkov&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, a family in Radkov witnessed a triangular, boomerang-shaped UFO while at a campfire. Two years later, a similar object was reportedly pursued by a military aircraft from Žatec over Western Bohemia, without success. In 1992, similar objects were observed in Cheb, near Prague, and near Dvůr Králové.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1987-vranov&#34;&gt;1987, Vranov &lt;a href=&#34;#1987-vranov&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vranov UFO incident, considered the most famous in the Czech Republic, occurred on July 12, 1987, in Vranov nad Dyjí above the Vranov Reservoir. A helicopter regiment was ordered to pursue a black, cigar-shaped object first located near the Austrian border. Pilots were instructed to shoot it down, but the object&amp;rsquo;s erratic movements and the presence of vacationers below prevented them. First Lieutenant Jaroslav Špaček reported the object flew towards their helicopter, forcing them to dodge it. The object then moved at high speed over Brno, Jaslovské Bohunice, and Bratislava before disappearing from radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1991-miličín&#34;&gt;1991, Miličín &lt;a href=&#34;#1991-mili%c4%8d%c3%adn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 12, 1991, a glowing round object was sighted near Miličín, causing panic among the local population. The sphere appeared randomly and silently followed people. Some witnesses reported seeing figures within the sphere, who allegedly left the sphere to &amp;ldquo;repair&amp;rdquo; something on a cottage roof, leaving behind large, four-fingered footprints. A local pastor reportedly told people it was a divine miracle and to remain silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1992-tři-sekery&#34;&gt;1992, Tři Sekery &lt;a href=&#34;#1992-t%c5%99i-sekery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 1992, military radars detected an object approaching the Czechoslovak border from Germany, crossing near Tři Sekery and heading towards Hvozd. Fighter jets and helicopters were dispatched, but despite radar visibility and ground observers, pilots could not locate the object. The object reportedly headed towards Chomutov and disappeared near Jirkov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1993-borová&#34;&gt;1993, Borová &lt;a href=&#34;#1993-borov%c3%a1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 21, 1993, a man in Borová encountered a flatfish-shaped object hovering above the road. The object then moved and floated noiselessly. The following day, numerous UFO sightings of various shapes and sizes were reported across the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2009&#34;&gt;2009 &lt;a href=&#34;#2009&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During late May 2009, multiple reports of flying objects emerged from various locations in the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 23, 2009, four people near Klínovec saw four orange lights flying at equal intervals. Similar objects were seen later that night above Chrást near Plzeň.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 24, 2009, people in Říčany observed three glowing spheres in the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 25, 2009, a university professor, who wished to remain anonymous, reported seeing disc-shaped objects resembling car high beams above the Brno highway.&lt;/li&gt;
