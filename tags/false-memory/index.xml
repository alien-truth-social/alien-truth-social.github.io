      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article details the alleged alien abduction of Barney and Betty Hill in 1961, a case that gained significant notoriety and influenced the alien abduction narrative. The article covers the background of the Hills, the details of their reported encounter, the aftermath, analysis of the star map Betty Hill claimed to have seen, and the cultural impact of their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney and Betty Hill were an interracial couple living in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Barney was a postal worker and Betty was a social worker. They were active in civil rights and community affairs. The article also mentions that they are the grandparents of UFC fighter Angela Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-encounter&#34;&gt;UFO Encounter &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-encounter&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 19-20, 1961, the Hills claimed to have encountered a UFO while driving back from a vacation in Canada. Near Lancaster, New Hampshire, Betty noticed a bright light in the sky. They stopped near Twin Mountain to observe the object, which Betty viewed through binoculars. Barney initially thought it was a commercial airliner, but it rapidly descended towards them. They continued driving, observing the object near Cannon Mountain and the Old Man of the Mountain. South of Indian Head, the object descended rapidly, causing Barney to stop the car. He observed humanoid figures through binoculars. Fearing capture, Barney ran back to the car, and as they drove away, they heard beeping sounds and experienced a daze. They reported the incident to NICAP investigator Walter Webb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;immediate-aftermath&#34;&gt;Immediate Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#immediate-aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home, the Hills noted odd sensations and unexplained occurrences. Betty insisted on keeping their luggage near the back door. Their watches stopped working. Barney found the binocular strap torn and his shoes scraped. They both took showers to remove possible contamination and drew pictures of what they had seen. Betty&amp;rsquo;s dress was torn and had a pinkish powder on it. Shiny, concentric circles appeared on their car&amp;rsquo;s trunk, which affected a compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34;&gt;Initial Report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member, interviewed the Hills. Barney mentioned a &amp;ldquo;mental block&amp;rdquo; and suspected he was suppressing parts of the event. Webb concluded that they were truthful, and the incident likely occurred as reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bettys-dreams&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Dreams &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-dreams&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after the encounter, Betty began experiencing vivid dreams for five consecutive nights. In her dreams, they encountered a roadblock and were forced into a forest by small men in blue uniforms. The men appeared nearly human with greyish skin. They were eventually returned to their car and watched the craft depart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34;&gt;Medical Help and More Interviews &lt;a href=&#34;#medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills sought medical help to understand their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;missing-time&#34;&gt;Missing Time &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-time&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a follow-up interview with NICAP members C.D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann, the Hills realized they had &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; â€“ a period of about seven hours they couldn&amp;rsquo;t account for. They recalled almost nothing of a 35-mile stretch of road and an image of a fiery orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;private-disclosure&#34;&gt;Private Disclosure &lt;a href=&#34;#private-disclosure&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the Hills privately disclosed their encounter to Captain Ben H. Swett of the United States Air Force, who was interested in the &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Hypnosis Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills underwent hypnosis with Dr. Benjamin Simon to recover their memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barneys-sessions&#34;&gt;Barney&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#barneys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under hypnosis, Barney recalled the binocular strap breaking as he ran from the UFO. He remembered being compelled to drive into the woods and seeing six men. He described the beings&amp;rsquo; terrifying eyes and their communication through &amp;ldquo;thought transference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bettys-sessions&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s account under hypnosis was similar to her dreams, with some differences. The technology on the craft was different, the short men differed significantly in physical appearance and the sequential order of the abduction differed. Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s memories in hypnotic regression were consistent with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simons-conclusions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Conclusions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-conclusions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon concluded that the case was a psychological aberration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34;&gt;Post-Hypnosis Publicity and Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s Death &lt;a href=&#34;#post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills initially kept a low profile. However, in 1965, a front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Boston Traveller&lt;/em&gt; revealed their story, leading to international attention. John G. Fuller wrote the book &lt;em&gt;The Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; about the case in 1966. Barney died in 1969, and Betty became a figure in the UFO community. Betty died in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-the-star-map&#34;&gt;Analyzing the Star Map &lt;a href=&#34;#analyzing-the-star-map&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Marjorie Fish, an amateur astronomer, attempted to decipher the star map Betty Hill had drawn. Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars and concluded that the map&amp;rsquo;s perspective matched the Zeta Reticuli star system. The analysis was debated, with Carl Sagan arguing it was a random alignment of points. Later, more accurate data from the Hipparcos mission led Fish to reject her hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interrupted-journey&#34;&gt;Interrupted Journey &lt;a href=&#34;#interrupted-journey&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; by John G. Fuller detailed the Hills&amp;rsquo; claims. Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s niece, Kathleen Marden, further explored these themes in &lt;em&gt;Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rebutting-the-hills&#34;&gt;Rebutting the Hills &lt;a href=&#34;#rebutting-the-hills&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Macdonald argued that the Hills&amp;rsquo; experience was caused by misinterpreting an aircraft warning beacon on Cannon Mountain, combined with stress, sleep deprivation, and false memories. Robert Sheaffer criticized Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s credibility, citing her UFO photos and later delusional stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34;&gt;Influence from &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt;. Jason Colavito pointed out other episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; that aired before Barney&amp;rsquo;s hypnosis sessions that were even more reminiscent of the Hill&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-media&#34;&gt;In Popular Media &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills&amp;rsquo; story has been depicted in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nonfictional-accounts&#34;&gt;Nonfictional Accounts &lt;a href=&#34;#nonfictional-accounts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney Hill appeared on &lt;em&gt;To Tell the Truth&lt;/em&gt; in 1966. Kathleen Marden and Stanton Friedman authored &lt;em&gt;Captured&lt;/em&gt; in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-fiction&#34;&gt;In Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1975 film &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; dramatized the Hills&amp;rsquo; abduction. The story has also been referenced in comic books, films like &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, virtual reality exhibits, and television series like &lt;em&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
