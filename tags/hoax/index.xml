&lt;h2 id=&#34;lilith&#34;&gt;Lilith &lt;a href=&#34;#lilith&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilith is a fictitious, invisible moon of Earth, proposed in 1918 by astrologer Walter Gorn Old (Sepharial). He claimed it had the same mass as Earth&amp;rsquo;s Moon. Sepharial associated it with the Lilith of Jewish legend and claimed it was the same second moon that scientist Georg Waltemath claimed to have discovered earlier. Sepharial claimed to have observed it crossing the Sun. The scientific community had already discredited Waltemath&amp;rsquo;s moon. Modern astrologers use the name Lilith to refer to the position of the Moon&amp;rsquo;s apogee. Black Moon Lilith is sometimes defined as the second focus of the ellipse described by the Moon&amp;rsquo;s orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-modern-astrology&#34;&gt;In Modern Astrology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-modern-astrology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contemporary astrology, &amp;ldquo;Lilith&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Black Moon Lilith&amp;rdquo; denotes a point on a horoscope corresponding to the Moon&amp;rsquo;s apogee. This point, considered the second focus of the Moon&amp;rsquo;s elliptical orbit (with Earth as the first), completes a zodiac circuit in approximately 8 years and 10 months, tracking apsidal precession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planets-proposed-by-l-ron-hubbard&#34;&gt;Planets Proposed by L. Ron Hubbard &lt;a href=&#34;#planets-proposed-by-l-ron-hubbard&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, proposed a Galactic Confederacy as part of his cosmology. This confederacy consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets, including Earth, then known as &amp;ldquo;Teegeeack.&amp;rdquo; Helatrobus is another planet mentioned in Scientology doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ummo&#34;&gt;Ummo &lt;a href=&#34;#ummo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummo is a hypothetical planet believed to be located in the Constellation Virgo. It is described in claims of communication between aliens from Ummo and people on Earth. This information was disseminated through detailed documents and letters sent to esoteric groups and UFO enthusiasts. The Ummo affair gained attention in France and Spain in the 1960s. Ummoism refers to groups interested in studying the ideas presented in the Ummo letters. JosÃ© Luis JordÃ¡n PeÃ±a has claimed responsibility for writing the letters, leading many to believe Ummo is a hoax. Jacques VallÃ©e compared the creators of the Ummo documents to the fictional creators of Borges&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;TlÃ¶n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.&amp;rdquo; Mike Dash notes that Ummoism began on February 6, 1966, in Madrid, when JordÃ¡n PeÃ±a claimed to have seen a UFO. Fernando Sesma Manzano, a contactee, became involved after receiving documents purportedly from the Ummites. Jean-Pierre Petit claims to have detected signs of superior intelligence in Ummite writings and that they have inspired his research in cosmology and magnetohydrodynamics. Antonio Ribera mentions 403 Ummo words in a 1978 compilation. Jean Pollion lists over a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planets-proposed-by-zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Planets Proposed by Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#planets-proposed-by-zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s work has gained attention among ufologists, ancient astronaut theorists, and conspiracy theorists. He claimed to have found evidence in Sumerian texts that extraterrestrials from a distant planet in the Solar System visited/created the human race. His theory involves an astronomical interpretation of the Babylonian creation myth, the &lt;em&gt;Enuma Elish&lt;/em&gt;, where he replaced the names of gods with hypothetical planets. Academics consider his work pseudoscience and pseudohistory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s theory proposes the planets Tiamat and Nibiru. Tiamat supposedly existed between Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit was disrupted by the arrival of Nibiru, which caused Tiamat to collide with one of Nibiru&amp;rsquo;s moons. The debris formed the asteroid belt and Earth. Sitchin claims the Babylonians associated Nibiru with the god Marduk. He hypothesized it as a planet in a highly elliptic orbit around the Sun, with a perihelion passage some 3,600 years ago. He claimed it was the home of the Anunnaki, who visited Earth in search of gold and created humanity by genetically crossing themselves with primates. Websites such as ZetaTalk have claimed that Nibiru or &amp;ldquo;Planet X&amp;rdquo; is a brown dwarf soon to pass close to Earth. Sitchin disagreed it is a star. Sitchin also postulated that Pluto began life as Gaga, a satellite of Saturn which, due to perturbation caused by Nibiru&amp;rsquo;s passing, was flung into orbit beyond Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;serpo&#34;&gt;Serpo &lt;a href=&#34;#serpo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Serpo is an alleged top-secret exchange program between the United States government and an alien planet called Serpo in the Zeta Reticuli star system. Details of the alleged exchange program have appeared in UFO conspiracy stories. In 1983, a man identifying himself as United States Air Force Sergeant Richard C. Doty contacted investigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe claiming to be able to supply her Air Force records of the exchange for her HBO documentary &lt;em&gt;The ET Factor&lt;/em&gt;, only to pull out without providing any evidence to substantiate his story. In 2005, a series of emails were sent to a UFO discussion group run by Victor Martinez claiming that the project was real. Some variations state that Serpo is the nickname of the extrasolar planet. The first mention of &amp;lsquo;Project Serpo&amp;rsquo; was in a UFO email list maintained by enthusiast Victor Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the most common version of the story, an alien survived a crash near Roswell in the later 1940s. This alien was detained but treated well by American military forces, contacted its home planet and eventually repatriated. This led to the establishment of a relationship between the American government and the people of its home world, said to be a planet of the binary star system Zeta Reticuli. Zeta Reticuli has a history in ufology, having been claimed as the home system of the Greys. Twelve American military personnel visited the planet between 1965 and 1978 and that all of the party have since died, from &amp;ldquo;after effects of high radiation levels from the two suns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One criticism of Project Serpo stems from the lack of veracity of one of its alleged witnesses, Sergeant Richard Doty. Doty has been involved in other alleged UFO-related activities, and thus is a discredited source. Additionally, there is no physical evidence supporting the project&amp;rsquo;s existence. According to Tim Swartz of &lt;em&gt;Mysteries Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, Doty, who promised evidence to Moulton Howe before backing out, has been involved in circulating several other UFO conspiracy stories. Bill Ryan, a chief proponent of publicizing the Project Serpo claims, announced on 5 March 2007, that he was stepping down from his role as webmaster for the Serpo material.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-travis-walton-incident&#34;&gt;The Travis Walton Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#the-travis-walton-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Travis Walton incident is an alleged alien abduction that occurred on November 5, 1975, involving American forestry worker Travis Walton in the Apacheâ€“Sitgreaves National Forests near Heber, Arizona. The incident is widely considered a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the alleged abduction, noting that in the early 1970s, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; tabloid offered a substantial prize for proof of extraterrestrial visitors, which may have motivated the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34;&gt;Travis Walton and the Turkey Springs forestry job &lt;a href=&#34;#travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the circumstances surrounding Travis Walton&amp;rsquo;s employment and the forestry contract. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; The forestry job was located in Turkey Springs, about 12 miles south of Heber, Arizona. The crew lived in Snowflake, 30 miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis Walton, his brother Duane, and crew chief Michael H. Rogers are central figures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Motive:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers&amp;rsquo;s forestry contract was behind schedule, potentially leading to financial penalties. The section notes that Walton had a prior criminal record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The Turkey Springs job involved thinning 1,277 acres by August 1975, later extended to November 10. Failure to complete the job could result in a $2,500 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Barney Hill and NBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the potential influence of the 1975 NBC television movie &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt;, which dramatized the alleged abduction of Barney and Betty Hill. It suggests that the film may have inspired Walton and Rogers to fabricate their own abduction story. Skeptics and psychologists are quoted arguing that the film could have motivated someone to claim an abduction for attention. It also mentions that Travis Walton told his mother not to worry if he were ever abducted by aliens because he would return safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the events of November 5, 1975, when Michael H. Rogers reported Travis Walton missing. The crew claimed they saw a lit object near the roadway, Walton approached it, and was struck by a light. The crew drove away in fear and returned to find Walton and the object gone. The police were notified, and a search was initiated. Deputy Kenneth Coplan noted the calm reaction of Walton&amp;rsquo;s mother to the news of his disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-person-investigation&#34;&gt;Missing person investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-person-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the search efforts and initial investigation following Walton&amp;rsquo;s disappearance. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Party:&lt;/strong&gt; A search party of nearly 50 people scoured the Turkey Springs area without success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&amp;rsquo;s Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Law enforcement were surprised by the calm reaction of Travis&amp;rsquo;s mother, who believed he was no longer on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFO Interest:&lt;/strong&gt; It was revealed that Travis, Duane, and their mother were interested in UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers and the crew underwent polygraph examinations to determine if they had harmed Walton. Five were deemed truthful, while one was inconclusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act of God Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers discussed the Forestry contract and the potential for an &amp;ldquo;Act of God&amp;rdquo; clause to excuse the delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walton-returns&#34;&gt;Walton returns &lt;a href=&#34;#walton-returns&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes Walton&amp;rsquo;s reappearance and subsequent events. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton called his sister&amp;rsquo;s home from a payphone in Heber, Arizona, on November 12, shortly after midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deputy Glen Flake:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy Flake witnessed Duane Walton transferring fuel from one car to another after having forgotten to purchase gas before local stations closed. Flake did not reveal that they knew Travis had returned home, and Duane did not tell the deputy that Travis had been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Duane sought medical attention for Travis, consulting with a hypnotherapist and later two medical doctors who were also amateur UFO investigators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheriff Gillespie:&lt;/strong&gt; Sheriff Gillespie insisted on interviewing Travis, but Duane and Travis demanded that the interview not be recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; provided a suite at the Sheraton Inn in Scottsdale in exchange for exclusive access to Walton and his story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis skipped a polygraph interview with police, but was later interviewed by Jack McCarthy a free-lance polygraph examiner arranged by a UFO group and the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;. McCarthy concluded that Travis was engaged in a &amp;ldquo;gross deception&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Television Interview:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton appeared on Phoenix television, claiming he lost consciousness and awoke in a hospital-like room with short, bald creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publicity-and-popular-culture&#34;&gt;Publicity and popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the media attention and cultural impact of the Walton incident. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for &amp;ldquo;best UFO case of the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism:&lt;/strong&gt; Skeptics, including Philip J. Klass, viewed the story as a hoax for financial gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book and Film:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton wrote &lt;em&gt;The Walton Experience&lt;/em&gt; in 1978, which was adapted into the 1993 film &lt;em&gt;Fire in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Appearances:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton has appeared at UFO conventions and on television, including &lt;em&gt;The Moment of Truth&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; podcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details a public dispute between Mike Rogers and Travis Walton in 2021. Rogers initially recanted his status as a witness to the abduction, claiming it was a hoax, but later reconciled with Walton and retracted his confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;modern-views&#34;&gt;Modern views &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents contemporary perspectives on the Walton incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the Walton family&amp;rsquo;s interest in UFOs and their reputation for pranks. It suggests that the incident may have been planned by Travis Walton and Mike Rogers. Crew member Steve Pierce expressed suspicion that the incident had been a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-enquirer-misrepresented-polygraph-results&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; misrepresented polygraph results &lt;a href=&#34;#national-enquirer-misrepresented-polygraph-results&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes that the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; publicized the opinion of a private polygraph examiner who reported the witnesses as being truthful, but omitted all mention of Walton&amp;rsquo;s prior polygraph examiner who concluded Walton was being &amp;ldquo;grossly deceptive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section contrasts Walton&amp;rsquo;s account with typical alien abduction narratives, noting that Walton didn&amp;rsquo;t report paralysis, recovered memories, or other common elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-role-of-fire-lookout-tower&#34;&gt;Possible role of fire lookout tower &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-role-of-fire-lookout-tower&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents Robert Sheaffer&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis that Rogers and the Waltons used a nearby fire lookout tower to create the illusion of a UFO. Sheaffer suggests that Travis walked towards the tower, which was brightly lit, and an accomplice illuminated him with a spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;belgian-ufo-wave&#34;&gt;Belgian UFO Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#belgian-ufo-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian UFO wave was a series of sightings of triangular UFOs in Belgium from November 29, 1989, to April 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sightings&#34;&gt;The Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#the-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the timeline and specifics of the UFO sightings during the Belgian UFO wave. It began in November 1989, with reports describing a large, flat, triangular object flying at low altitude. The peak of the wave occurred on the night of March 30, 1990. On that night, an unknown object was tracked on radar, prompting the Belgian Air Force to send two F-16s to investigate. While the pilots didn&amp;rsquo;t visually confirm the object, many people claimed to have witnessed it. The Control Reporting Center (CRC) at Glons received initial reports of unusual lights moving towards Thorembais-Gembloux. Traffic Center Control at Semmerzake tracked an object on radar, leading to the scrambling of two F-16 fighters from Beauvechain Air Base. The F-16s attempted nine interceptions, achieving radar lock briefly on three occasions, but these locks were later determined to be on each other. Members of the Wavre gendarmerie reported seeing four lights in a square formation, making jerky movements before disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;patrick-marÃ©chal-hoax-photograph&#34;&gt;Patrick MarÃ©chal Hoax Photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#patrick-mar%c3%a9chal-hoax-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the famous &amp;ldquo;Petit-Rechain photo,&amp;rdquo; which depicted a black triangular object with lights. The photo was widely circulated and examined by various organizations, including NASA, the French National Centre for Scientific Research, and the Belgian Royal Military Academy. For two decades, the UFOlogical organization &lt;em&gt;SociÃ©tÃ© belge d&amp;rsquo;Ã©tude des phÃ©nomÃ¨nes spatiaux&lt;/em&gt; (SOBEPS) claimed the photo was genuine. However, in 2011, photographer Patrick MarÃ©chal confessed that it was a hoax. He explained that he had constructed the UFO from a polystyrene triangle with lightbulbs to prank his workmates. Brian Dunning discussed the photograph in his Skeptoid podcast, highlighting it as emblematic of the quality of evidence during the Belgian UFO wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores various explanations proposed for the Belgian UFO wave. In 1992, Marc Hallet criticized SOBEPS, arguing that the wave was a mass delusion fueled by misinformation. Pierre Magain and Marc Remy suggested that the phenomenon would be better studied by human scientists than physicists. Renaud Leclet and co. proposed that some sightings could be explained by helicopters, with the lack of noise attributed to environmental factors. Jean-Michel Abrassart argued that the beginning of the wave aligns with the psychosocial hypothesis. Auguste Meessen defended the unexplained nature of the wave, prompting rebuttals from Roger Paquay and Jean-Michel Abrassart. Brian Dunning discussed the F-16 chase, noting that radar locks were likely on each other due to atmospheric interference (Bragg scattering). He concludes that the sightings were a psychosocial phenomenon, explaining the lack of substantial evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;gulf-breeze-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Gulf Breeze UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#gulf-breeze-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Breeze UFO incident refers to a series of claimed UFO sightings that occurred in Gulf Breeze, Florida, between November 1987 and May 1988. The events gained widespread attention after the &lt;em&gt;Gulf Breeze Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; newspaper published photographs purportedly showing a UFO, provided by local contractor Ed Walters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;events-of-november-11-1987--may-1-1988&#34;&gt;Events of November 11, 1987 â€“ May 1, 1988 &lt;a href=&#34;#events-of-november-11-1987--may-1-1988&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Walters claimed to have been immobilized by a blue beam on November 11, 1987, after which he took photos of a UFO hovering near his home. He reported multiple subsequent encounters, taking more photos and even videotaping the object. Walters also claimed to have witnessed the craft landing and aliens exiting, communicating with him telepathically in English and Spanish, and even being lifted off the ground by a blue beam. He reported a total of nineteen sightings or encounters. On one occasion, he claimed the UFO leaked a liquid that continued to boil for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigation&#34;&gt;Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters initially provided his photographs to the &lt;em&gt;Gulf Breeze Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; anonymously. He later admitted to being the photographer and submitted to a polygraph test, which indicated he believed his photos were real. Walters also claimed to have experienced missing time on three prior occasions and under hypnosis, stated he had been abducted by aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several individuals investigated the claims. Ray Stanford initially questioned the weather data related to the photos but later conceded they were likely taken on the reported day. Phillip Klass dismissed the photos as inauthentic. Robert Nathan from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggested the images were double exposures or manipulated. Ed Gray, the mayor of Gulf Breeze, also concluded the photos were fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budd Hopkins believed Walters&amp;rsquo; claims were genuine, citing his polygraph test and refusal of a book deal. Bruce Maccabee found a good chance the photos were real. Willy Smith from UNICAT suggested a support under the UFO in the photos indicated it was a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eglin Air Force Base, located near Gulf Breeze, reported no unusual activity or radar blips during the alleged sightings. Gulf Breeze&amp;rsquo;s police chief, Jerry Brown, attributed the sightings to hysteria and misidentification of activity at the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;eyewitness-reports&#34;&gt;Eyewitness Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#eyewitness-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of Walters&amp;rsquo; photos, numerous other residents reported sightings in the Gulf Breeze area. These reports described orange glows, beams of light, and oval or oblong crafts. Fenner McConnell and his wife Shirley claimed to have seen a disc-shaped aircraft with no wings. Brenda Pollak, a Gulf Breeze councilwoman, reported seeing an orange light and witnessed Walters taking photos of a UFO at Shoreline Park. Santa Rosa County Commissioner John Broxson also claimed to have seen unusual lights. Other residents, like Art and Mary Hufford, and Jeff Thompson, reported seeing similar objects. A tollbooth operator, Jerry Thompson, reported seeing thirteen pink-lighted objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-research-group-response&#34;&gt;UFO Research Group Response &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-research-group-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Walters, particularly within MUFON, viewed the mass sightings as evidence of the phenomena&amp;rsquo;s authenticity. MUFON&amp;rsquo;s director, Walter Andrus, considered the Gulf Breeze incident their &amp;ldquo;best case ever.&amp;rdquo; Donald Ware, MUFON&amp;rsquo;s Florida director, believed the aliens wanted the photos to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUFOS, founded by J. Allen Hynek, deemed Walters&amp;rsquo; photos fake due to inconsistencies in the craft&amp;rsquo;s windows and waviness suggesting reflection off water. Friends of Walters reportedly described him as a prankster who had planned &amp;ldquo;the ultimate prank&amp;rdquo; and noted parallels between his story and Whitley Streiber&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-discovered&#34;&gt;Model Discovered &lt;a href=&#34;#model-discovered&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, a model resembling the UFO in Walters&amp;rsquo; photos was found in the attic of his former home. The model was made of foam plates and drafting paper. Craig Myers of the &lt;em&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported the discovery and was able to duplicate Walters&amp;rsquo; photos using the model. Walters denied any knowledge of the model, claiming it was planted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the model caused division within the UFO community. Supporters claimed it was planted, while others expressed doubt in Walters&amp;rsquo; claims. It was also revealed that Walters had received a $200,000 book advance and was offered $450,000 for miniseries rights. Additionally, he had a prior criminal record for forgery and auto theft, for which he received a pardon from Governor Bob Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;renewed-interest-after-1990&#34;&gt;Renewed Interest After 1990 &lt;a href=&#34;#renewed-interest-after-1990&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO sightings continued at the Pensacola Bay Bridge into 1991. In 1993, a friend of the Walters family admitted to witnessing Ed faking the UFO pictures. Mark Curtis also reported that Walter and his wife had divorced in November 1992, splitting $2.5 million in assets believed to have come from the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUFON held its first annual UFO symposium in Pensacola in 1990, which continued for the rest of the decade. The publicity attracted tourists and UFO sightseers, boosting the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-media&#34;&gt;In the Media &lt;a href=&#34;#in-the-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Breeze UFO case was featured on &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt; and a TV special called &amp;ldquo;UFO Cover-UP&amp;hellip;Live!&amp;rdquo;. Eyewitness Shirley McConnell discussed her experience on &lt;em&gt;A Current Affair&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;A Current Affair&lt;/em&gt; filmed more UFO shows in July 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1994 episode of &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, Fox Mulder mentions the Gulf Breeze UFO photos, stating he knew they were fakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulf Breeze singer Ken Manning won an award for his song &amp;ldquo;Gulf Breeze UFO&amp;rdquo; in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning to England, Ray and Gary discover the film has degraded. To avoid repercussions from their investor, Laszlo Voros, they decide to recreate the autopsy film.

&lt;p&gt;They sell the film, earning a large sum of money. Voros demands a larger share of the profits but is killed in a mysterious accident.

&lt;p&gt;Ray and Gary attempt to restore the original 1947 footage, but after viewing the results, they decide to bury the film.&lt;/p&gt;
