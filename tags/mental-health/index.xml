      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;psychological-perspectives-on-ufo-belief&#34;&gt;Psychological Perspectives on UFO Belief &lt;a href=&#34;#psychological-perspectives-on-ufo-belief&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of sighting, visitation, and contact with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been the subject of medical and psychological research. Some research suggests psychopathological origins for these claims, while others propose that &amp;ldquo;experiencers&amp;rdquo; may simply have overactive imaginations. Treatment approaches include antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-a-mental-health-disorder&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as a Mental Health Disorder &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-a-mental-health-disorder&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the idea that belief in UFOs and extraterrestrial contact may be linked to underlying mental health conditions. It highlights research suggesting that individuals claiming face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials (ETs) may have distinct psychological profiles compared to those without such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research &lt;a href=&#34;#research&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies are presented that explore the potential link between UFO beliefs and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1983 study in the &lt;em&gt;Canadian Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; examined six individuals claiming extraterrestrial contact and concluded that five suffered from a paranoid delusional state akin to paraphrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1997 study by researchers at the University of Essex found an association between UFO-related beliefs and schizotypy, a construct that may indicate a risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2008 study published in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals alleging alien abduction showed higher levels of dissociativity and a tendency to hallucinate compared to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;individual-experiencers&#34;&gt;Individual Experiencers &lt;a href=&#34;#individual-experiencers&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents case studies of individuals whose belief in alien encounters was linked to mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2000 case study at Boston University Medical Center described a married couple with shared psychotic disorder involving a belief in alien abductions. The husband had a history of mental health issues and suicide attempts, and the couple&amp;rsquo;s shared delusion reinforced their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2008 case at the University of Louisville involved a woman with sleep paralysis who believed she was being abducted by aliens. Her belief was attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the paralysis and cultural acclimation to the alien abduction phenomenon. Psychotherapy improved her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 case study from Nova Southeastern University reported on a 17-year-old boy who felt &amp;ldquo;as if he is being chased by Martians.&amp;rdquo; He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with risperidone, cognitive behavioral therapy, and counseling to stop using marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-a-personality-trait&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as a Personality Trait &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-a-personality-trait&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the idea that belief in UFOs may be related to certain personality traits, particularly fantasy-prone personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons with a fantasy-prone personality spend a significant portion of their lives involved in fantasy and may confuse or mix their fantasies with their real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew suggests that some individuals are prone to exceptionally vivid fantasies and have difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality. Science journalist Eric Smalley hypothesizes that &amp;ldquo;starseeds&amp;rdquo; may be experiencing the Barnum effect, with books providing a sense of authenticity to their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology professor Robert Baker proposed fantasy-prone personality as an explanation for UFO contacts, noting that individuals reporting such contacts are not necessarily psychotic or neurotic, just &amp;ldquo;a little different.&amp;rdquo; Armando Simon, a staff psychologist at the Texas Department of Corrections, argued that belief in UFOs is a cultural norm in North America and not necessarily a sign of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1991 study of 152 individuals reporting alien abductions found that 132 exhibited characteristics consistent with fantasy-prone personality. A 2001 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of UFO and Abduction Studies&lt;/em&gt; found that persons who reported seeing UFOs tended &amp;ldquo;to have a richer fantasy life than those who do not report UFOs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-faulty-perceptuality&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as Faulty Perceptuality &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-faulty-perceptuality&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines how cognitive and perception psychology can explain UFO beliefs, focusing on how human perception, cognitive biases, and psychological tendencies shape beliefs about UAP stimuli. Joey Florez explored UAPs through comparative institutional psychology, focusing on the intuitive and conspiratorial mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florez explains that understanding flawed perception entails considering anomalous phenomena from antiquity, given the over-reliance on superstition and illogical assumptions about the external world. Ancient Greeks interpreted bright flashes in the sky as Zeus firing lightning bolts, reinforcing divine authority and political legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two central modes of information processing, intuitive and conspiratorial, can be used to identify modern UAP beliefs from a cognitive and perceptual perspective. Primary experiences with UAP stimuli often involve intuitive processing, while secondary experiences often involve conspiratorial processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pareidolia refers to anomalies in the brain&amp;rsquo;s initial perception of recognizable patterns in ambiguous visual stimuli, while apophenia is intentional and results in complex convictions of conspiratorial narratives. Research has suggested cognitive reflection and education may reduce narcissistic susceptibility to conspiratorial processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-studies-and-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other Studies and Hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-studies-and-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents additional research and perspectives on UFO belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1993 study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Abnormal Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found no difference in psychopathology and fantasy proneness between persons alleging abduction by UFOs and those with more mundane UFO experiences, concluding that UFO belief did not have a psychopathological origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in 2017 in &lt;em&gt;Motivation and Emotion&lt;/em&gt; found that paranormal beliefs related to extraterrestrial life were partly motivated by the need for meaning in life, with persons experiencing a lack of life meaning demonstrating a higher propensity for such beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard University psychiatrist John E. Mack suggested that some patients related actual encounters with non-humans or non-human controlled UFOs that were not explainable as mental illness. However, a Harvard review committee concluded that Mack was not using &amp;ldquo;rational and scholarly&amp;rdquo; research methods. Mack&amp;rsquo;s use of hypnosis to elicit purportedly repressed memories of abduction experiences has also been criticized. UCLA psychiatrist Fred Frankel and Michael D. Yapko criticized Mack&amp;rsquo;s use of hypnosis, explaining that fantasy and suggestion play a major role during hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
