      <title>Westall UFO</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;westall-ufo&#34;&gt;Westall UFO &lt;a href=&#34;#westall-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Westall UFO incident refers to a reported UFO sighting that occurred on April 6, 1966, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The event involved multiple witnesses, including students and a teacher from Westall High School. The incident has been commemorated through documentaries, reunions, and a UFO-themed playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reports&#34;&gt;Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 6, 1966, students and a teacher at Westall High School (now Westall Secondary College) reported observing a round, white, grey, or silver object with a domed top. The object reportedly descended behind trees into the Grange, an open area south of the school. Some accounts mention the object being pursued by five unidentified aircraft. Shaun Matthews, who was on vacation at the Grange, described the object as having a slight purple hue and being about twice the size of a family car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witness accounts varied, with some reporting the object taking off after landing, while others claimed it hovered. Students who went to the Grange after the sighting described a landing site with varying details, including a circle of grass described as burnt, &amp;ldquo;boiled,&amp;rdquo; or pressed down. The number of circles reported ranged from one to three. On April 9, 1966, air force personnel and UFO enthusiasts visited the field but found nothing of interest. The landowner subsequently burned the field to prevent further access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; newspaper initially suggested the object might have been a weather balloon released from Laverton. However, checks revealed that no commercial, private, or RAAF pilots reported anything unusual in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Basterfield proposed that a runaway balloon from the HIBAL high-altitude balloon project, used to monitor radiation levels after British nuclear tests at Maralinga, could be a likely explanation. He cited documents indicating a test balloon launched from Mildura may have drifted off course and landed near Westall High School. Basterfield noted that HIBAL balloons had a white silver appearance with a parachute and gas tube, consistent with witness descriptions. Reports also surfaced of &amp;ldquo;men in suits&amp;rdquo; cautioning witnesses against discussing the incident, suggesting a secret government exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Dunning suggested that a weather balloon could explain the initial sighting. He proposed that a nylon target drogue, towed by one plane for others to chase, could account for the second part of the event. Dunning also noted that over time, descriptions of the event have become mixed with fabricated details, making it difficult to discern accurate accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media-coverage&#34;&gt;Media Coverage &lt;a href=&#34;#media-coverage&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary &lt;em&gt;Westall &amp;lsquo;66&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the sighting, featuring interviews conducted by ufologist Shane Ryan. &lt;em&gt;Westall &amp;lsquo;66&lt;/em&gt; has been incorporated into the national history curriculum as a lesson on critical analysis of popular portrayals of historical events. &lt;em&gt;The Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary film directed and co-produced by ufologist James Fox, includes content related to the Westall UFO case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;local-culture&#34;&gt;Local Culture &lt;a href=&#34;#local-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A witness reunion was held at Westall Tennis Club Hall on April 8, 2006, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the incident. The City of Kingston created Grange Reserve UFO Park at The Grange Reserve in Clayton South, featuring a silver UFO with red slides to reflect the 1966 Westall UFO Incident.&lt;/p&gt;
