        <h1 id="alien-abduction">Alien Abduction <a href="#alien-abduction" class="anchor">🔗</a></h1><p>Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. Those who claim to have been abducted are referred to as &ldquo;abductees&rdquo; or &ldquo;experiencers.&rdquo; The prevailing scientific and mental health perspective attributes these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology. Skeptics draw parallels between alien descriptions and science fiction films like <em>Invaders From Mars</em> (1953).</p>
<p>Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, particularly focusing on reproductive systems. Some abductees report warnings about environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or involvement in interspecies breeding. The narratives often vary based on the abductee&rsquo;s cultural background. UFOs, alien abduction, and mind control are sometimes integrated into radical political apocalyptic and millenarian narratives.</p>
<p>Reports are global, but most common in English-speaking countries, especially the United States. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 was the first widely publicized case. UFO abduction claims have declined since the mid-1970s, possibly due to the increased availability of camera phones.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview <a href="#overview" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Mainstream scientists generally dismiss claims of literal alien abduction. John E. Mack, a psychiatrist who gave credence to such claims, noted that most abductees are sane individuals, with psychopathology present in only some cases. Detailed abduction reports have led to the development of a subculture with support groups and a mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, etc.). Some claimants conduct independent research and attribute the lack of wider awareness to extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.</p>
<h2 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><h3 id="paleo-abductions">Paleo-abductions <a href="#paleo-abductions" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Before the widespread attention to &ldquo;alien abduction&rdquo; in the 1960s, some older stories have been speculated as possible cases, termed &ldquo;paleo-abductions&rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1896, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them.</li>
<li>In 1953, an article in <em>Man to Man Magazine</em> questioned whether humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.</li>
<li>In 1955, Harold T. Wilkins&rsquo;s <em>Flying Saucers Uncensored</em> reported the mysterious disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who had claimed contact with aliens, speculating they were victims of abduction by flying saucers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-landmark-cases">Two landmark cases <a href="#two-landmark-cases" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 generated widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident was a prototypical case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p>These cases established a template for later abductees and researchers. Purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954.</p>
<h3 id="later-developments">Later developments <a href="#later-developments" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>R. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s and became convinced of its actuality. He was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually, Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989. Budd Hopkins became interested in abduction reports in the 1970s and used hypnosis to extract more details, becoming a figurehead of the abductee subculture.</p>
<p>The 1980s brought mainstream attention to the subject through works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard&rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published.</p>
<p>Accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of ufology. Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected, estimating that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.</p>
<p>Jacobs and Hopkins argued that aliens were attempting to create human–alien hybrids, the most advanced stage of which in the &ldquo;human hybridization program&rdquo; are known as hubrids, though the motives for this effort were unknown.</p>
<p>Descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher&rsquo;s emphasis.</p>
<p>According to <em>Boston Globe</em> writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Skeptic Michael Shermer noted that &ldquo;the camera-phone age is increasing the burden of evidence on experiencers&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="john-e-mack">John E. Mack <a href="#john-e-mack" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce writing in <em>The Lancet</em> called him &ldquo;a well-meaning man uncritically elaborating on tales of alien abduction, and potentially both cementing and constructing false memories&rdquo;. Boyce observed that Mack&rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression of claimants helped spread the Grey aliens meme into the culture.</p>
<p>Mack became interested in claims of alien abduction in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people and eventually writing two books on the subject. Due to Mack&rsquo;s belief and subsequent promotion of the claims of those he interviewed, his professional reputation suffered, prompting Harvard to review his position in 1994. He retained tenure, but &ldquo;was not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore”.</p>
<h2 id="abductees">Abductees <a href="#abductees" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population allege to have been abducted.</p>
<h3 id="demographics">Demographics <a href="#demographics" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Although abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.</p>
<h3 id="mental-health">Mental health <a href="#mental-health" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &ldquo;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&rdquo;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking&rdquo;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &ldquo;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="political-conspiracy-theories">Political conspiracy theories <a href="#political-conspiracy-theories" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Political scientist Michael Barkun highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed &ldquo;improvisional millenarism&rdquo;. UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives, where alleged orthodoxy is claimed to be maintained in error for nefarious purposes and to keep society in ignorance. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.</p>
<p>According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like <em>The X-Files</em> and its motion picture not only included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters but also featured demonization of FEMA, a common target of conspiracy theorists and millenarian scenarios. One conspiracy theory alleges that FEMA plans to incarcerate &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; suddenly in concentration camps during a disaster. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &ldquo;consensus reality&rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.</p>
<p>Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering it important to warn the world of such imminent danger.</p>
<h2 id="abduction-narrative">Abduction narrative <a href="#abduction-narrative" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS&rsquo;s definition of <em>abductee</em>, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &ldquo;recovered&rdquo; through means like hypnosis.</p>
<p>Although different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind&rdquo; (a popular but unofficial designation building on J. Allen Hynek&rsquo;s classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.</p>
<p>Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:</p>
