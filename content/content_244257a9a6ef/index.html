        <h1 id="extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis">Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis <a href="#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as physical spacecraft occupied by intelligent extraterrestrial organisms or probes designed by them.</p>
<h2 id="usage-of-the-term">Usage of the Term <a href="#usage-of-the-term" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section traces the use of the term &ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&rdquo; in UFO literature back to the 1960s. Key figures mentioned include French ufologist Jacques VallÃ©e, who used the term in his 1966 book, and French engineer AimÃ© Michel. James E. McDonald and James Harder also used the term in 1968, including during testimony before Congress. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &ldquo;ETH&rdquo; in 1969 when presenting the findings of the Condon Report.</p>
<h2 id="chronology">Chronology <a href="#chronology" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section explores the historical roots of the ETH, tracing it back to earlier concepts such as Percival Lowell&rsquo;s ideas about Martian canals and civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups like NICAP and APRO.</p>
<h2 id="historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits">Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits <a href="#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section provides examples of early speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a story from 1864 about American geologists discovering an alien-like creature inside an egg-shaped structure. It also discusses H. G. Wells&rsquo; <em>The War of the Worlds</em> and the &ldquo;mystery airships&rdquo; reported in the late 19th century, with some speculating they were from Mars. The section also notes the influence of comic strips, radio, and movie serials like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon on popularizing the idea of alien visitation in spaceships. The 1938 radio broadcast of <em>The War of the Worlds</em> by Orson Welles is mentioned as creating public panic.</p>
<h2 id="the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america">The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America <a href="#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section focuses on the events following Kenneth Arnold&rsquo;s sighting of unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier in June 1947. It notes that Arnold quickly considered the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial. The section mentions the speculation in newspapers about the nature of the objects, including comments from U.S. Senator Glen Taylor and R. DeWitt Miller. It also references Charles Fort&rsquo;s earlier documentation of unidentified flying objects. The section highlights that most people were initially unwilling to conclude the objects were extraterrestrial, with theories such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria being more popular. It cites a Gallup poll from August 1947 showing that most people either had no opinion or believed in a mundane explanation.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-public-opinion">Evolution of Public Opinion <a href="#evolution-of-public-opinion" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section examines how public opinion on UFOs and the ETH evolved. It mentions the release of several movies in the early 1950s depicting flying saucers and aliens. It cites a <em>Popular Science</em> poll from 1951 indicating that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen man-made aircraft, while only a small percentage believed they had seen an alien craft. By 1957, a quarter of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A Roper poll in 2002 reported that a majority of respondents thought UFOs were real, with nearly half believing they had visited Earth.</p>
<h2 id="religion">Religion <a href="#religion" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society founded by George King in 1955 as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.</p>
<h2 id="nasa">NASA <a href="#nasa" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses NASA&rsquo;s evolving stance on UAPs. It mentions that in June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP using scientific methods. Kopparapu presented a paper in August 2021 that supported ETH.</p>
<h2 id="private-or-government-studies">Private or Government Studies <a href="#private-or-government-studies" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section details private and governmental studies that have supported the ETH or had members who dissented from official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&rsquo;s Top Secret Estimate of the Situation in 1948, which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation for unexplained cases, but was ordered destroyed. A secret West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. The CIA&rsquo;s internal review of UFOs is mentioned, with some scientists considering the ETH. The section also notes individuals within Project Blue Book, such as Major Dewey Fournet and consultant J. Allen Hynek, who supported the ETH. Statements from former CIA Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter and Greek physicist Paul Santorini are included. The section also mentions the COMETA report, and Jean-Jacques Velasco&rsquo;s book.</p>
<h2 id="critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth">Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH <a href="#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It states that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien presence on Earth. It notes that no rigorous analysis has ever concluded that UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.</p>
<h2 id="us-military-investigation-and-debunkery">U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery <a href="#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses the U.S. military&rsquo;s involvement in investigating and debunking UFOs. It mentions the Army Air Forces Intelligence&rsquo;s secret study of saucer reports in 1947 and the formation of Project Sign. It notes that Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The CIA&rsquo;s Office of Scientific Investigation took interest in UFOs following the 1952 UFO flap. The Robertson Panel, organized by the CIA in 1953, reviewed Blue Book&rsquo;s evidence and recommended a policy of public debunkery.</p>
<h2 id="involvement-of-scientists">Involvement of Scientists <a href="#involvement-of-scientists" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section highlights the scientific community&rsquo;s lack of support for the ETH. It mentions Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s skepticism and quotes Carl Sagan&rsquo;s warning against self-deception in accepting or rejecting the idea of extraterrestrial visitation. It also quotes Peter A. Sturrock&rsquo;s call for examining other possible theories beyond the ETH. The section presents the results of Sturrock&rsquo;s polls of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and American Astronomical Society members, showing limited support for the ETH. It summarizes J. Allen Hynek&rsquo;s seven key reasons for not accepting the ETH, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.</p>
<h2 id="fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology">Fewer Sightings Despite Camera Phone Technology <a href="#fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section notes that the proliferation of smartphone camera technology has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, which has called into question the claimed phenomenology of UFOs.</p>
<h2 id="nasa-1">NASA <a href="#nasa-1" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section states NASA&rsquo;s official position as of 2006, which is that the ETH lacks empirical evidence. It quotes David Morrison&rsquo;s statements that no one has ever found a single artifact or convincing evidence for alien visits.</p>
<h2 id="cia">CIA <a href="#cia" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section mentions the CIA&rsquo;s organization of the Robertson Panel in 1953 to debunk the data collected by Project Blue Book.</p>
<h2 id="official-white-house-position">Official White House Position <a href="#official-white-house-position" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section presents the White House&rsquo;s official response in November 2011 to petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge alien visits and disclose any withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. The response states that the U.S. government has no evidence of life outside our planet or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.</p>
<h2 id="counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories">Counter Critique of the Official Position: Conspiracy Theories <a href="#counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses the concept of a conspiracy of silence or official cover-up to conceal information about UFOs. It mentions James Harder&rsquo;s argument in 1968 that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs but had been suppressed. It cites a 1971 survey showing that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs than believed in the existence of UFOs or the ETH itself. It also mentions comments from former NASA astronauts Gordon Cooper and Brian O&rsquo;Leary about NASA and the government suppressing UFO sightings.</p>
