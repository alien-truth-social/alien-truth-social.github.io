        <h1 id="extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis">Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis <a href="#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as physical spacecraft occupied by intelligent extraterrestrial organisms or probes designed by them.</p>
<h2 id="usage-of-the-term">Usage of the Term <a href="#usage-of-the-term" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section traces the use of the term &ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&rdquo; in UFO literature back to the mid-1960s. Key figures mentioned include French ufologist Jacques VallÃ©e, who used the term in his 1966 book, and French engineer AimÃ© Michel, who used it in a 1967 publication. James E. McDonald and James Harder also used the term in 1968, including during testimony before a Congressional committee. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book. Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &ldquo;ETH&rdquo; after defining it in the Condon Report (1969).</p>
<h2 id="chronology">Chronology <a href="#chronology" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section explores the historical roots of the ETH, tracing it back to earlier concepts such as Percival Lowell&rsquo;s ideas about Martian canals and civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups like NICAP and APRO.</p>
<h2 id="historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits">Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits <a href="#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section provides historical examples of speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a story from 1864 about the discovery of a mummified alien-like creature. It also discusses H. G. Wells&rsquo; &ldquo;The War of the Worlds&rdquo; (1898), which popularized the idea of Martian invasion, and the &ldquo;mystery airships&rdquo; of the late 19th century, which some speculated were from Mars. Comic strips, radio shows, and movie serials like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon also contributed to the idea of alien visitation. Orson Welles&rsquo; 1938 radio broadcast of &ldquo;The War of the Worlds&rdquo; caused public panic.</p>
<h2 id="the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america">The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America <a href="#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section focuses on the surge of UFO sightings in 1947, beginning with Kenneth Arnold&rsquo;s sighting of unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier. Arnold considered the possibility of extraterrestrial origins, and fan mail suggested the same. Senator Glen Taylor expressed a wish for the flying saucers to be spaceships from another planet to unify Earth. R. DeWitt Miller suggested they could be vehicles from Mars or other dimensions. The work of Charles Fort was also brought up. However, most people were unwilling to immediately conclude that the objects were extraterrestrial, and various other theories proliferated. A Gallup poll in August 1947 showed that most people either had no opinion or believed there was a mundane explanation.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-public-opinion">Evolution of Public Opinion <a href="#evolution-of-public-opinion" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section examines how public opinion regarding the ETH evolved. It mentions movies from the early 1950s depicting flying saucers and aliens. A 1951 poll reported that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen a man-made aircraft, while only a small percentage believed they had seen an alien craft. By 1957, 25% of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A 2002 Roper poll reported that 56% of respondents thought UFOs were real, with 48% believing that UFOs had visited Earth.</p>
<h2 id="religion">Religion <a href="#religion" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.</p>
<h2 id="nasa">NASA <a href="#nasa" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses NASA&rsquo;s involvement with UAPs. In June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP and presented a paper in August 2021 supporting ETH.</p>
<h2 id="private-or-government-studies">Private or Government Studies <a href="#private-or-government-studies" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section presents examples of private or government studies that have concluded in favor of the ETH or had members who disagreed with official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&rsquo;s Top Secret Estimate of the Situation (1948), which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation, but was ordered destroyed. A West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. The CIA started their own internal scientific review. Extraterrestrial &ldquo;believers&rdquo; within Project Blue Book included Major Dewey Fournet and director Edward J. Ruppelt. The first CIA Director, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, urged Congressional action to reduce secrecy about UFOs. In 1967, Greek physicist Paul Santorini claimed that a 1947 Greek government investigation concluded that the European Ghost rockets of 1946 were extraterrestrial. David Saunders disagreed with the negative conclusion of the 1968 Condon Report. The 1999 French COMETA report concluded that the extraterrestrial visitor hypothesis was the most likely explanation for UFO phenomena. Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of the official French UFO investigation SEPRA, wrote that 14% of the cases studied were extraterrestrial in origin.</p>
<h2 id="critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth">Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH <a href="#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It states that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien presence on Earth. No rigorous analysis has ever concluded that UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.</p>
<h2 id="us-military-investigation-and-debunkery">U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery <a href="#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses the U.S. military&rsquo;s involvement in investigating and debunking UFOs. Army Air Forces Intelligence began a secret study of saucer reports in July 1947. The U.S. Air Force&rsquo;s Project Sign was formed at the end of 1947. In 1948, Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The CIA&rsquo;s Office of Scientific Investigation took particular interest in UFOs after the 1952 UFO wave. The CIA organized the Robertson Panel in 1953, which recommended a policy of public debunkery to reduce UFO reports.</p>
<h2 id="involvement-of-scientists">Involvement of Scientists <a href="#involvement-of-scientists" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses the scientific community&rsquo;s lack of support for the ETH. Reports of UFOs are generally attributed to misinterpretations of common objects or phenomena, or hoaxes. Stephen Hawking expressed skepticism about the ETH. Carl Sagan noted the emotional nature of the idea of extraterrestrial visitation and the potential for self-deception. Peter A. Sturrock argued that the focus on the ETH has narrowed the debate. Sturrock conducted polls of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and American Astronomical Society members, which showed limited support for the ETH. J. Allen Hynek outlined seven key reasons why he could not accept the ETH, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.</p>
<h2 id="fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology">Fewer Sightings Despite Camera Phone Technology <a href="#fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section notes that the proliferation of smartphone camera technology has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, which has called into question the claimed phenomenology of UFOs.</p>
<h2 id="nasa-1">NASA <a href="#nasa-1" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section states that NASA&rsquo;s official standpoint is that the ETH lacks empirical evidence. David Morrison stated that no one has ever found a single artifact or any other convincing evidence for alien visits.</p>
<h2 id="cia">CIA <a href="#cia" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section mentions that the CIA organized the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk the data collected by the Air Force&rsquo;s Project Blue Book.</p>
<h2 id="official-white-house-position">Official White House Position <a href="#official-white-house-position" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses the White House&rsquo;s official response to petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge alien visits and disclose any withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. The response stated that the U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.</p>
<h2 id="counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories">Counter Critique of the Official Position: Conspiracy Theories <a href="#counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section introduces the concept of a conspiracy of silence or an official cover-up suppressing information about UFOs. In 1968, James Harder argued that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs but had been suppressed. A 1971 survey showed that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs than believed in the existence of UFOs or the ETH itself. Former NASA astronauts, such as Gordon Cooper and Brian O&rsquo;Leary, have commented on the government&rsquo;s alleged suppression of UFO sightings.</p>
