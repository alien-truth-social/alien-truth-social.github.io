        <h1 id="extraterrestrial-life">Extraterrestrial Life <a href="#extraterrestrial-life" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no such life has been conclusively detected, it could range from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The study of extraterrestrial life falls under the domain of astrobiology.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context <a href="#context" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section provides a framework for understanding the conditions necessary for life in the universe. It begins with the Big Bang and the early universe, highlighting the initial extreme temperatures and the subsequent formation of elements like carbon and oxygen through stellar fusion. The emergence of planetary systems and organic compounds in protoplanetary disks is discussed, leading to the possibility of abiogenesis on planets like Earth. The concept of panspermia, the spread of life between habitable planets, is also introduced.</p>
<p>The context extends to Earth&rsquo;s place in the Solar System, the Milky Way galaxy, and the larger universe, emphasizing the vast distances that pose challenges to studying extraterrestrial life. The limitations of current technology, such as probes and telescopes, are acknowledged. The circumstellar habitable zone, or &ldquo;Goldilocks zone,&rdquo; is explained as an area around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet&rsquo;s surface, but it&rsquo;s noted that habitability is complex and depends on various factors. The section concludes by considering the age of the universe and the possibility that life on other planets may have emerged and become extinct long ago. Avi Loeb&rsquo;s &ldquo;Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe&rdquo; is mentioned, suggesting a period shortly after the Big Bang when conditions might have been suitable for primitive life. The adaptability of life on Earth, even in extreme environments, is highlighted, but it&rsquo;s also noted that habitability does not guarantee the presence of life.</p>
<h2 id="likelihood-of-existence">Likelihood of Existence <a href="#likelihood-of-existence" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section explores the debate over whether life in the cosmos is common or rare. The hypothesis of ubiquitous extraterrestrial life rests on the size and age of the universe, the ubiquity of life&rsquo;s chemical elements, and the universality of physical laws. Scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view, which is embodied in the Copernican and mediocrity principles.</p>
<p>The Rare Earth hypothesis, which posits that life on Earth is possible due to a unique combination of factors, is presented as an opposing viewpoint. The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation&rsquo;s variables, such as the rate of star formation and the fraction of planets that support life, are explained. The Drake equation is controversial because many of its values are speculative. The section concludes by discussing the Fermi paradox, the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for their existence. Dennis W. Sciama, Zhi-Wei Wang, and Samuel L. Braunstein&rsquo;s contributions to the Fermi Paradox are mentioned.</p>
<h2 id="biochemical-basis">Biochemical Basis <a href="#biochemical-basis" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section discusses the potential forms and requirements of extraterrestrial life. It considers a range of possibilities, from simple microorganisms to complex alien intelligences. The basic requirements for life, such as non-equilibrium thermodynamics and a source of energy, are outlined. Stars, volcanoes, plate tectonics, and hydrothermal vents are mentioned as potential energy sources.</p>
<p>The importance of liquid water as a solvent for biochemical reactions is emphasized, but alternatives like ammonia and liquid hydrocarbons are also considered. The section explores the chemical elements that could compose extraterrestrial life, focusing on carbon and potential replacements like silicon. The advantages and disadvantages of silicon-based life are discussed. Norman Horowitz&rsquo;s view on the versatility of carbon is noted.</p>
<p>The section also considers the potential for radically different biochemistries, even if life is based on carbon and water. The requirements for natural selection, such as replication, damage avoidance, and resource acquisition, are outlined. The evolution from simple cells to eukaryotes and multicellular organisms is discussed, along with the possibility of convergent evolution leading to similar lifeforms on other planets. Simon Conway Morris&rsquo;s ideas on convergent evolution are mentioned. Research assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence is also noted.</p>
<h3 id="harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life">Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life <a href="#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section addresses the common perception that the harsh conditions on other planets make them unlikely to harbor life. It presents evidence that some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs.</p>
<p>The section highlights the chemosynthetic processes that occur around hydrothermal vents, allowing organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon. These reactions enable organisms to live in low-oxygen environments. The early Earth environment was reducing, making these carbon-fixing compounds essential for survival. The section suggests that similar processes could occur on other planets with reducing atmospheres, potentially leading to the origin of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<h2 id="planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system">Planetary Habitability in the Solar System <a href="#planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section examines the potential for life on other bodies within our Solar System. Besides Earth, Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most likely candidates.</p>
<p>Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that may have once been similar to Earth, but now has a runaway greenhouse effect and a thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere. The possibility of microbial life in high-altitude clouds is mentioned. Mars is described as a cold, airless desert, but with evidence of abundant water in the past, suggesting it may have been habitable. The loss of its magnetic field and atmosphere is noted.</p>
<p>The gas giants and ice giants are considered unlikely to harbor life, but their moons are of interest. Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are mentioned as having subsurface oceans, with Europa being the most promising due to contact between its ocean and rocky surface. Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, is highlighted for its eruption columns that release water into space, containing complex organic molecules, salts, hydrogen, and methane. Titan, another moon of Saturn, is unique for having liquid bodies on its surface, composed of hydrocarbons, but its cold temperatures may limit chemical activity.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-search">Scientific Search <a href="#scientific-search" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section outlines the scientific methods used to search for extraterrestrial life. Astrobiology, the science that studies life in the universe, is introduced. It encompasses various scientific disciplines, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric sciences.</p>
<p>The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets is mentioned, along with the potential for primitive life on other planets and moons in the Solar System. Studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus (via phosphine) and Mars (via methane) are noted.</p>
<h3 id="search-for-basic-life">Search for Basic Life <a href="#search-for-basic-life" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section focuses on the search for biosignatures, indicators of life, within the Solar System and beyond. Scientists study planetary surfaces and examine meteorites for evidence of past or present life.</p>
<p>The controversial report of nanobacteria-like structures in the ALH84001 meteorite, originating from Mars, is mentioned. The Viking Mars landers&rsquo; gas emission experiments, which some scientists interpret as evidence of living microorganisms, are discussed. NASA&rsquo;s Mars Science Laboratory and the Curiosity rover&rsquo;s mission to assess past and present habitability on Mars are highlighted.</p>
<p>The development of a catalog of microorganisms and their reactions to sunlight is mentioned as a tool for identifying similar organisms on exoplanets. The discovery of nucleobases in meteorites found in Antarctica is noted, suggesting that organic molecules may be generated within asteroids and comets. The presence of complex organic compounds in cosmic dust is also mentioned. The detection of glycolaldehyde, a sugar molecule needed to form RNA, in a distant star system is highlighted. The discovery of hydrogen cyanide in the plumes of Enceladus is mentioned as a possible chemical essential for life.</p>
<h3 id="search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences">Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences <a href="#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section shifts the focus to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). It discusses the possibility of detecting civilizations through technosignatures, effects on their native planet that may not be caused by natural causes.</p>
<p>Interstellar communications, atmospheric effects, and planetary-sized structures like Dyson spheres are mentioned as potential technosignatures. Organizations like the SETI Institute search for radio waves and laser pulses. The challenges of distinguishing artificial signals from natural sources and the limitations of current telescopes are acknowledged.</p>
<p>The potential for detecting nitrogen dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and light pollution in exoplanet atmospheres is discussed. The Kardashev scale, which proposes that civilizations may eventually consume energy directly from their local star, is introduced. The possibility of detecting heavy elements in a star&rsquo;s light spectrum as evidence of nuclear waste disposal is also mentioned.</p>
<h3 id="extrasolar-planets">Extrasolar Planets <a href="#extrasolar-planets" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section discusses the search for exoplanets that may be conducive to life. Astronomers focus on terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars.</p>
<p>The discovery of thousands of exoplanets is mentioned, ranging in size from Earth-like to gas giants. The Kepler space telescope&rsquo;s detection of thousands of candidate planets is highlighted. The estimate that there is at least one planet per star and that a significant fraction of Sun-like stars have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone is noted.</p>
<p>The nearest known exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, is mentioned. The least massive and most massive exoplanets known are identified. The study of planetary habitability considers a wide range of factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life. The presence of oxygen in a planet&rsquo;s atmosphere is mentioned as a potential sign of life. The use of spectrography to analyze exoplanet atmospheres during transit is discussed.</p>
<h2 id="history-and-cultural-impact">History and Cultural Impact <a href="#history-and-cultural-impact" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section explores the historical development of ideas about extraterrestrial life and its cultural influence.</p>
