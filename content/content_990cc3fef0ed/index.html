        <h1 id="crop-circle">Crop Circle <a href="#crop-circle" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>A crop circle, also known as a crop formation or corn circle, is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two hoaxers, claimed responsibility for creating over 200 crop circles throughout England. Reported circles often appear near roads, populated areas, and cultural heritage monuments like Stonehenge and Avebury, typically appearing overnight. Archaeological remains can cause cropmarks, but these are different from crop circles as they don&rsquo;t appear overnight and are always in the same locations.</p>
<h1 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><h2 id="before-the-20th-century">Before the 20th Century <a href="#before-the-20th-century" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>A 1678 news pamphlet, <em>The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire</em>, describes a crop with cut stalks. In 1686, naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings of mushrooms, proposing air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991, meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles. An 1880 letter to <em>Nature</em> by John Rand Capron describes circles of flattened crops possibly caused by &ldquo;cyclonic wind action.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="20th-century">20th Century <a href="#20th-century" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester. David Wood reported making crop circles near Gloucestershire in 1940 using ropes. In 1963, Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire and circular areas in nearby wheat fields, suggesting air currents from the impact as a cause. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler suggested lightning strikes. During the 1960s, there were reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada. In 1966, a farmer in Tully witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise from a swamp, leaving a circular area of flattened grass. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported starting to create crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully &ldquo;saucer nest&rdquo; case. The 1974 film <em>Phase IV</em> depicted a geometric crop circle created by super-intelligent ants. Reports of crop circles increased in the late 1970s, becoming widely known in the late 1980s after media coverage in Hampshire and Wiltshire. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles had been reported internationally.</p>
<h2 id="21st-century">21st Century <a href="#21st-century" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes and incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics. Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not randomly spread but appeared near roads, populated areas, and cultural heritage monuments, suggesting intentional human action.</p>
<h1 id="bower-and-chorley">Bower and Chorley <a href="#bower-and-chorley" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley claimed to have started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978, using simple tools. They demonstrated their method to journalists, fooling &ldquo;cereologist&rdquo; Pat Delgado. They claimed responsibility for all circles made prior to 1987 and for over 200 crop circles in 1978â€“1991. Richard Taylor noted that their creations inspired a second wave of crop artists.</p>
<h1 id="art-and-business">Art and Business <a href="#art-and-business" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Increasingly complex geometric designs have been created by anonymous artists, sometimes to attract tourists. The UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles as art and for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set featured an image of a crop circle. A crop-circle-making competition was held in Berkshire in 1992, with the winning entry produced by Westland Helicopters engineers. In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned MIT graduate students to create crop circles. In 2009, <em>The Guardian</em> reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, as makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies. A video sequence used in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening in London showed crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A crop circle depicting the <em>Star Wars</em> Rebel Alliance emblem was created in California in 2017.</p>
<h1 id="legal-implications">Legal Implications <a href="#legal-implications" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>In 1992, GÃ¡bor TakÃ¡cs and RÃ³bert Dallos were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle in Hungary. They were sued for damages, but the judge ruled they were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes.</p>
<h1 id="creation">Creation <a href="#creation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><h2 id="human-origin">Human Origin <a href="#human-origin" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The scientific consensus is that crop circles are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. A common method involves using a rope and board to flatten the plants. Skeptics point out that all characteristics of crop circles are compatible with human creation. Bower and Chorley confessed to making the first crop circles in southern England. Increasingly complex circles started appearing worldwide, with physicists suggesting that the most complex formations might be made with GPS and lasers.</p>
<h2 id="natural-origins">Natural Origins <a href="#natural-origins" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id="weather">Weather <a href="#weather" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by these causes. In 1880, John Rand Capron blamed circles in crops on a recent storm. In 1980, Terence Meaden proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds. Stephen Hawking said that &ldquo;Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="animal-activity">Animal Activity <a href="#animal-activity" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In 2009, the attorney general for Tasmania stated that wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies after consuming them.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-explanations">Alternative Explanations <a href="#alternative-explanations" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id="paranormal">Paranormal <a href="#paranormal" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Since the 1980s, crop circles have been the subject of speculation by paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators, ranging from bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. Some speculate that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lightning and controlled by some entity, such as Gaia, God, supernatural beings, the collective minds of humanity, or extraterrestrial beings. The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &ldquo;man-made.&rdquo; No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-crops">Changes to Crops <a href="#changes-to-crops" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Some scientists have claimed to observe differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made. Joe Nickell objected to these claims, raising objections to the methods and assumptions.</p>
<h1 id="related-art">Related Art <a href="#related-art" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow, sand, and forests.</p>
<h1 id="folklore">Folklore <a href="#folklore" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Researchers have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales. Crop circles appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, the origin of tales of &ldquo;fairie rings.&rdquo; A 17th-century English woodcut, the <em>Mowing-Devil</em>, depicts the devil mowing a circular design in a field of oats. In the 1948 German story <em>Die zwÃ¶lf SchwÃ¤ne</em>, a farmer finds a circular ring of flattened grain in his field every morning, caused by princesses disguised as swans dancing in the field.</p>
