        <h1 id="crop-circle">Crop Circle <a href="#crop-circle" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>A crop circle, also known as a crop formation or corn circle, is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural causes or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two hoaxers, claimed responsibility for creating over 200 crop circles throughout England. Reported circles in the United Kingdom appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population, and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury, and usually appear overnight. Archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but these do not appear overnight, and are always in the same places every year.</p>
<h1 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><h2 id="before-the-20th-century">Before the 20th century <a href="#before-the-20th-century" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>A 1678 news pamphlet <em>The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire</em> describes a crop whose stalks were cut rather than bent. In 1686, English naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms in <em>The Natural History of Stafford-Shire</em>, proposing air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991, meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles. An 1880 letter to the editor of <em>Nature</em> by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how several circles of flattened crops in a field were formed under suspicious circumstances and possibly caused by &ldquo;cyclonic wind action&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="20th-century">20th century <a href="#20th-century" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester. In <em>Fortean Times,</em> David Wood reported that in 1940 he made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. In 1963, Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire and several circular and elliptical areas in nearby wheat fields. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes. During the 1960s, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada. On 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully &ldquo;saucer nest&rdquo;. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported they started creating crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully &ldquo;saucer nest&rdquo; case. The first film to depict a geometric crop circle, in this case created by super-intelligent ants, was the 1974 science-fiction film <em>Phase IV</em>. The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared and spread since the late 1970s. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally.</p>
<h2 id="21st-century">21st century <a href="#21st-century" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity. The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury.</p>
<h1 id="bower-and-chorley">Bower and Chorley <a href="#bower-and-chorley" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, made headlines by saying they had started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978, using simple tools. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a &ldquo;cereologist&rdquo;, Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978â€“1991.</p>
<h1 id="art-and-business">Art and business <a href="#art-and-business" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>After reports of simple circles in the 1970s, increasingly complex geometric designs have been created by anonymous artists, in some cases to attract tourists to an area. Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of its art practice and also for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set that was released on 7 September 1990, features an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. On the night of 11â€“12 July 1992, a crop-circle-making competition with a prize of Â£3,000 was held in Berkshire. In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own. In 2009, <em>The Guardian</em> reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts. A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A 3 ha (7 acres) crop circle depicting the emblem of the <em>Star Wars</em> Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017.</p>
<h1 id="legal-implications">Legal implications <a href="#legal-implications" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>In 1992, GÃ¡bor TakÃ¡cs and RÃ³bert Dallos, both then aged 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle in Hungary. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes.</p>
<h1 id="creation">Creation <a href="#creation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><h2 id="human-origin">Human origin <a href="#human-origin" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands.</p>
<h2 id="natural-origins">Natural origins <a href="#natural-origins" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id="weather">Weather <a href="#weather" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes. In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal <em>Nature</em> about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm. In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.</p>
<h3 id="animal-activity">Animal activity <a href="#animal-activity" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-explanations">Alternative explanations <a href="#alternative-explanations" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>In science magazines from the 1980s and 1990s, one could read reports suggesting that the plants were bent by something that could be microwave radiation, rather than broken by physical impact.</p>
<h3 id="paranormal">Paranormal <a href="#paranormal" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have been the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators, ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lightning and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Responding to local beliefs that &ldquo;extraterrestrial beings&rdquo; in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &ldquo;man-made&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-crops">Changes to crops <a href="#changes-to-crops" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have claimed to observe differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man made.</p>
<h1 id="related-art">Related art <a href="#related-art" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow, by using skis, snow shoes or just walking with ordinary shoes. Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in sand. Images can be made in forests by cutting trees, especially in areas with snow.</p>
<h1 id="folklore">Folklore <a href="#folklore" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Crop circles are culture dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularised Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they do not appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of &ldquo;fairie rings&rdquo;. A 17th-century English woodcut called the <em>Mowing-Devil</em> depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. In the</p>
