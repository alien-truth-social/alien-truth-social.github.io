        <h1 id="grey-aliens">Grey Aliens <a href="#grey-aliens" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are purported extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 popularized the image of Grey aliens. These beings have become an archetypal image of extraterrestrial life and a popular trope in science fiction.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description <a href="#description" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id="appearance">Appearance <a href="#appearance" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Greys are generally described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin and reduced or absent external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. They have disproportionately large heads, no hair, and small openings for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their most striking feature is their large, opaque, black eyes. They are often described as shorter than average adult humans.</p>
<h3 id="association-with-zeta-reticuli">Association with Zeta Reticuli <a href="#association-with-zeta-reticuli" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system originated with Marjorie Fish&rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the aliens showed her a map of their home system and nearby stars. Fish created a model based on Hill&rsquo;s drawing and identified the aliens&rsquo; home as Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.</p>
<h2 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id="origins">Origins <a href="#origins" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Descriptions of beings similar to Grey aliens predate claims of encounters. H.G. Wells described future humans with large heads and lacking mouths, noses, or hair in his 1893 article &ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&rdquo; and his 1895 novel <em>The Time Machine</em>. In 1917, Aleister Crowley described a meeting with a &ldquo;preternatural entity&rdquo; named Lam, resembling a modern Grey. In 1933, Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren (Gabriel Linde) described aliens with grey clothes, bald heads, and large eyes in his science fiction novel <em>The Unknown Danger</em>.</p>
<h3 id="barney-and-betty-hill-abduction">Barney and Betty Hill abduction <a href="#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The archetype became famous in 1965 with newspaper reports of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. The Hills claimed that in 1961, grey-skinned humanoid aliens abducted them and took them aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested Barney&rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by an episode of <em>The Outer Limits</em> titled &ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&rdquo; which aired shortly before Barney&rsquo;s first hypnotic session and featured an alien with large eyes. Carl Sagan echoed this suspicion, citing <em>Invaders from Mars</em> as another potential inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="diffusion-into-folklore">Diffusion into folklore <a href="#diffusion-into-folklore" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>After the Hill&rsquo;s encounter, Greys became integral to ufology and extraterrestrial folklore, especially in the United States, where they account for 73% of reported alien encounters. During the early 1980s, Greys were linked to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published <em>Communion</em>, a non-fiction book describing his alleged encounters with Greys, which became a bestseller and was adapted into a film. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu described &ldquo;the little greys&rdquo; on French television, popularizing the term <em>les Petits-Gris</em>.</p>
<p>Greys have since become the subject of many conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of a government disinformation campaign or products of mind-control experiments. During the 1990s, popular culture increasingly linked Greys to military-industrial complex and New World Order conspiracy theories. In 1995, Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage of an autopsy of a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Grey recovered from Roswell, though he later admitted it was a &ldquo;reconstruction.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis <a href="#analysis" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id="in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology">In close encounter claims and ufology <a href="#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Greys are often involved in alien abduction claims, accounting for a significant percentage of reports in Australia, the United States, continental Europe, and the United Kingdom. These reports often describe traumatic experiences, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes are a focal point in these claims, with abductees describing Greys staring into their eyes to induce hallucinogenic states or provoke emotions.</p>
<h3 id="psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence">Psychocultural expression of intelligence <a href="#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Neurologist Steven Novella proposes that Grey aliens are a product of the human imagination, with their features representing traits associated with intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="the-mother-hypothesis">The &ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&rdquo; <a href="#the-mother-hypothesis" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Frederick V. Malmstrom suggests that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development, reconstructing the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother&rsquo;s face.</p>
<h3 id="evolutionary-implausibility">Evolutionary implausibility <a href="#evolutionary-implausibility" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Biologist Jack Cohen argues that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.</p>
<h3 id="other-hypotheses">Other hypotheses <a href="#other-hypotheses" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The interdimensional, cryptoterrestrial, and time-traveler hypotheses attempt to provide alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of these alleged beings.</p>
<h2 id="in-popular-culture">In popular culture <a href="#in-popular-culture" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Grey aliens have become a common depiction of extraterrestrials in fiction, supplanting the &ldquo;little green men.&rdquo; They have appeared in films and television shows like <em>Ultraman</em>, <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>, <em>Babylon 5</em>, and <em>Stargate</em>. During the 1990s, plotlines linking Greys to conspiracy theories became common, as seen in <em>The X-Files</em>. Other examples include the <em>XCOM</em> video game franchise, <em>Dark Skies</em>, and <em>American Dad!</em>. The film <em>Paul</em> attributes the Greys&rsquo; presence in pop culture to the US government deliberately inserting their image into mainstream media. The 2013 film <em>Dark Skies</em> features child abduction by Greys. Greys also appear in the Syfy series <em>Resident Alien</em> and the 2023 game <em>Greyhill Incident</em>.</p>
