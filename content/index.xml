      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-reported-ufo-sightings&#34;&gt;List of Reported UFO Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-reported-ufo-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article provides a compilation of notable reported sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), including claims of close encounters and alien abduction. It clarifies that UFOs encompass any aerial phenomenon that cannot be immediately identified, noting that most are eventually explained as known objects or atmospheric phenomena. The article also mentions the use of the term &amp;ldquo;Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) to avoid associations with UFO conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;antiquity&#34;&gt;Antiquity &lt;a href=&#34;#antiquity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details alleged UFO sightings from ancient times, drawing from historical texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. 1450 BC:&lt;/strong&gt; The Tulli Papyrus describes an event during Thutmose III&amp;rsquo;s reign in Ancient Egypt, where a &amp;ldquo;star came down&amp;rdquo; and set fire to his adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;218 BC:&lt;/strong&gt; Reports from the Roman Republic in Italia mention &amp;ldquo;phantom navy&amp;rdquo; seen shining in the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;76 BC:&lt;/strong&gt; An account from Asia (Roman Republic) describes a &amp;ldquo;spark&amp;rdquo; falling from a star, growing to the size of the Moon, and then transforming into a torch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;73 BC:&lt;/strong&gt; Plutarch recounts a &amp;ldquo;flame-like body&amp;rdquo; resembling a wine-jar (pithos) falling between Roman and Pontic armies in Phrygia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AD 65:&lt;/strong&gt; Flavius Josephus reports chariots &amp;ldquo;hurtling through the clouds&amp;rdquo; in Judaea before the First Jewish–Roman War.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AD 196:&lt;/strong&gt; Cassius Dio describes a &amp;ldquo;fine rain resembling silver&amp;rdquo; falling from a clear sky in Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8th-century&#34;&gt;8th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#8th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section contains a single entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. AD 740:&lt;/strong&gt; The &amp;ldquo;Air ship of Clonmacnoise&amp;rdquo; is recorded in Irish annals, describing &amp;ldquo;ships with their crews were seen in the air&amp;rdquo; over Teltown and Clonmacnoise in Ireland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;16th17th-centuries&#34;&gt;16th–17th Centuries &lt;a href=&#34;#16th17th-centuries&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists reports from the Renaissance and early modern periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1897:&lt;/strong&gt; S.E. Hayden reports the crash of an airship piloted by an alien in Aurora, Texas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;20th-century&#34;&gt;20th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is divided into two sub-sections: 1900-1949 and 1950-1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;19001949&#34;&gt;1900–1949 &lt;a href=&#34;#19001949&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;19501974&#34;&gt;1950–1974 &lt;a href=&#34;#19501974&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the mid to late 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1950:&lt;/strong&gt; A farmer takes pictures of a purported &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; near McMinnville, Oregon.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1951:&lt;/strong&gt; Two pilots and a military officer passenger aboard a commercial DC-3 reported being buzzed by an unidentified straight-winged plane over Sioux City, Iowa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1951:&lt;/strong&gt; Several lights in V-shaped formations were repeatedly spotted flying over the city of Lubbock, Texas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1952:&lt;/strong&gt; Four American military personnel aboard two different B-29 bombers reported seeing an orange globe-shaped light over two different cities in northern Korea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1952:&lt;/strong&gt; A series of sightings accompanied radar contacts in the Washington, D.C. area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1952:&lt;/strong&gt; William B. Nash and William H. Fortenberry, pilots of a DC-4 airliner of Pan American Airways, radioed the Norfolk civil aviation authority to report eight large, round, glowing red objects.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Perspectives on the alien abduction phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_c0a6e9617f65/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_c0a6e9617f65/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;perspectives-on-the-alien-abduction-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Perspectives on the Alien Abduction Phenomenon &lt;a href=&#34;#perspectives-on-the-alien-abduction-phenomenon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explores various explanations for claims of alien abduction and examination by otherworldly beings. Perspectives range from complete disbelief to the acceptance of these claims as objective reality. Some researchers, like Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack, acknowledge an &amp;ldquo;authentic mystery&amp;rdquo; surrounding the phenomenon, urging consideration of all associated aspects, including missing time, UFO sightings, and occurrences in children. The mainstream scientific view leans towards a psychosocial explanation rooted in human psychology, neurology, and culture, while others, including conspiracy theorists and ufologists, believe in literal extraterrestrial abductions. Authors like Jacques Vallée and John E. Mack suggest the need to re-evaluate our understanding of reality to comprehend the phenomenon fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the idea that alien abduction is a real phenomenon where extraterrestrial beings abduct humans for study or experimentation. The elusiveness of these beings is attributed to their advanced technology. The hypothesis lacks widespread support among mainstream scientists due to the absence of physical evidence and the contradictory nature of abduction accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;literary-perspectives&#34;&gt;Literary Perspectives &lt;a href=&#34;#literary-perspectives&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the appeal of alien abduction accounts from a literary standpoint. Terry Matheson suggests that these tales are captivating due to their depiction of human powerlessness. The section contrasts the temporary fear experienced from ghost stories with the inescapable nature of alien abductions, which the abduction myth suggests cannot be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skeptical-perspectives&#34;&gt;Skeptical Perspectives &lt;a href=&#34;#skeptical-perspectives&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines skeptical explanations for alien abduction reports, focusing on psychological processes rather than extraterrestrial beings. Skeptics critically examine claims for evidence of hoaxes or influence from popular culture. Brian Dunning notes psychological explanations such as hallucination, temporary schizophrenia, epileptic seizures, and parasomnia (including hypnagogic states, night terrors, and sleep paralysis). Sleep paralysis, often accompanied by hallucinations, is presented as a potential explanation, although individuals experiencing it do not typically interpret it as alien encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hoax&#34;&gt;Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section addresses the possibility of alien abduction claims being hoaxes, motivated by financial gain or attention. While some skeptics believe abductees are lying, it is acknowledged that most abductees genuinely believe in their experiences, making simple fabrication an insufficient explanation for the majority of claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychopathology&#34;&gt;Psychopathology &lt;a href=&#34;#psychopathology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the view, once common but now largely unsupported by scientists, that those claiming alien abduction are mentally ill. Studies have found that alleged abductees are generally no more likely to suffer from psychopathologies than the general population. However, abductees often score higher in tests measuring hypnotic suggestibility, absorption, magical ideation, and dissociative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;false-memory-hypothesis&#34;&gt;False Memory Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#false-memory-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the false memory hypothesis, a widely accepted theory in the scientific community, which explains how psychologically healthy individuals may develop and maintain a belief in alien abduction through psychological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sleep-paralysis&#34;&gt;Sleep Paralysis &lt;a href=&#34;#sleep-paralysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details how sleep paralysis, often accompanied by feelings of chest pressure and hypnopompic hallucinations (such as flying, lights, presences, and figures), can contribute to abduction experiences. Cultural beliefs strongly influence the content of these hallucinations. Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s comparison of alien abduction experiences to historical tales of demon abduction is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lucid-dreams&#34;&gt;Lucid Dreams &lt;a href=&#34;#lucid-dreams&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the connection between lucid dreams and alien abduction experiences. Research from the Phase Research Center suggests that experiences of close encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials can be products of the human mind during lucid dreaming. A 2021 study found that a significant percentage of volunteers could emulate alien encounters via lucid dreams, with some experiencing sleep paralysis and fear similar to &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; abduction stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hypnosis&#34;&gt;Hypnosis &lt;a href=&#34;#hypnosis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the use of hypnosis in recovering memories of &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; in abduction cases, starting with the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. It notes that individuals interested in UFOs may seek therapists with similar beliefs, potentially leading to the creation of false memories under hypnosis due to increased suggestibility. Thomas Bullard notes that hypnotized subjects are more likely to confabulate or be open to memory implantation. Budd Hopkins&amp;rsquo; counterargument, citing the Hill case, is also presented. Skeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass suggest that individual abduction researchers influence the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cultural-impact&#34;&gt;Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the influence of cultural factors on abduction claims. Skeptics argue that variations in abduction details across cultures support a psycho-social hypothesis. The section notes that abduction accounts may be influenced by science fiction, citing the resemblance between the Betty and Barney Hill case and media they had recently consumed. It also mentions how abduction claims have changed over time to align with scientific discoveries about the solar system. Robert Sheaffer highlights differences in the types of aliens reported in different countries and similarities between aliens in early science fiction films and abduction reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;maintenance-of-abduction-memories&#34;&gt;Maintenance of Abduction Memories &lt;a href=&#34;#maintenance-of-abduction-memories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses how abductees maintain their beliefs, even when faced with disbelief. Many seek support groups where they find validation from others with similar experiences, reinforcing the accuracy of their abduction memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drug-induced-hallucinations&#34;&gt;Drug-Induced Hallucinations &lt;a href=&#34;#drug-induced-hallucinations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the possibility that some alleged abductions are drug-induced hallucinations. It mentions Terence McKenna&amp;rsquo;s experiences with &amp;ldquo;Machine Elves&amp;rdquo; while using DMT and Rick Strassman&amp;rsquo;s research at the University of New Mexico, which found that a significant percentage of volunteers injected with high doses of DMT had experiences similar to purported alien abductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parallels-with-other-phenomena&#34;&gt;Parallels with Other Phenomena &lt;a href=&#34;#parallels-with-other-phenomena&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section draws parallels between the abduction phenomenon and other unusual events, such as witchcraft claims. Robert Sheaffer notes similarities in imagery, uncovered memories, and sex, suggesting a common underlying psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section also notes Gwen Dean&amp;rsquo;s presentation of 44 parallels between alien abduction and satanic ritual abuse (SRA) at a 1992 MIT conference. Both phenomena emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, often use hypnosis, and feature similar elements such as familial involvement, generational occurrences, examination tables/altars, focus on genitals/sexuality/breeding, altered states of consciousness, and &amp;ldquo;missing time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abductors-as-demonic-manifestations&#34;&gt;Abductors as Demonic Manifestations &lt;a href=&#34;#abductors-as-demonic-manifestations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the view that abduction experiences share similarities with pre-20th century accounts of demonic manifestations. Writers have noted numerous similarities. Fr. Seraphim Rose, an Orthodox monk, dedicates a chapter in his book &lt;em&gt;Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future&lt;/em&gt; to UFOs and abductions, concluding that they are manifestations of the demonic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings about environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that many abductees are sane individuals, with psychopathology only present in some cases. Detailed abduction reports have led to the development of a subculture with support groups and a complex mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types, such as Greys, Reptilians, and Nordics. Some abductees engage in independent research and attribute the lack of wider awareness to extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. One example is Colonel H. G. Shaw&amp;rsquo;s 1896 claim of being harassed by tall, slender humanoids. An article from 1953 asked if flying saucers were kidnapping humans for zoological specimens or vivisection. The 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two landmark cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil during the mid-1950s was an early claim but received limited attention initially. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the phenomenon in the 1960s and linked abductions to cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became a key figure in the abductee subculture in the 1970s, using hypnosis to uncover details of remembered events. The 1980s saw increased mainstream attention, with works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack presenting alien abduction as a plausible experience. Thomas E. Bullard&amp;rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than previously thought, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been abducted. They also proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of widespread interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, alien abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer suggests that the ubiquity of camera phones has increased the burden of evidence, contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, suggested that Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression helped spread the Grey aliens meme. Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. His professional reputation suffered due to his belief and promotion of abduction claims, leading to a Harvard review in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. Early studies found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys suggested 5–6 percent of the general population claim to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While abduction reports are usually made by adults, children sometimes report similar experiences. These reports often share specific details with adult reports, including circumstances, narrative, entities, and aftermaths. Young abductees often have family members who have reported abduction experiences, and family involvement in the military or residence near a military base is also common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that abductees are not different from the general population in terms of psychopathology prevalence. Elizabeth Slater&amp;rsquo;s blind study found abductees prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking,&amp;rdquo; nightmares, and weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally&amp;rsquo;s study concluded that none of the abductees suffered from psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlights links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, and government takeover. He observed the rise of &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism.&amp;rdquo; UFO and abduction stories can be part of stigmatized knowledge narratives. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters, and demonized FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities and may resort to questionable regression therapy. Some espouse conspiracy theories of technological mind control, including implants, to force them to serve a New World Order or for the purposes of the antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. CUFOS defines an abductee as someone taken against their will by non-human beings to an extraterrestrial place or spaceship, subjected to examination or communication, with memories that may be conscious or recovered through hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although cases vary, some UFO researchers argue that there is a fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;: Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp;amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time&lt;/strong&gt;: Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location or with new injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany&lt;/strong&gt;: Abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;: The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says that the entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated, with predetermined procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience, such as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place or expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will occur. They also report feeling severe anxiety. Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. External sounds cease to have any significance, and they report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts, lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, often through solid objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge of the operation is often taller than the others and may appear to be of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. The abductors&amp;rsquo; areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems given less attention include the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx, and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the &amp;ldquo;examination.&amp;rdquo; Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives, although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subsequent-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2024&#34;&gt;National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 &lt;a href=&#34;#national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (NDAA 2024) is a United States federal law that outlines the budget, expenditures, and policies of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for fiscal year 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Defense Authorization Act is an annual bill proposed in the United States Congress that redefines the United States military budget for the following fiscal year. Each chamber of Congress introduced a version of the NDAA: H.R. 2670 in the House and S. 2226 in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House passed their version on July 14, 2023 by a vote of 219–210. Led by Chuck Schumer and Mike Rounds, the Senate passed theirs on July 27, 2023 by a vote of 86–11. The Senate then replaced H.R. 2670 with the text of S. 2226 and passed it by unanimous consent, and indefinitely postponed S. 2226. The House disagreed to the Senate amendment and asked to hold conference on September 19, with the Senate insisting on its amendment and agreeing to conference on November 15. The subsequent conference report was filed on December 6 (H. Rept. 118-301). The bill was approved by the Senate and House and sent to President Joe Biden on December 14. Biden signed it into law on December 22. In his signing statement, Biden expressed reservations about provisions that restrict the executive branch&amp;rsquo;s discretion in Guantanamo detainee transfers and raised constitutional concerns regarding congressional oversight and foreign policy authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provisions&#34;&gt;Provisions &lt;a href=&#34;#provisions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section requires updating to reflect recent events or newly available information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-objects-ufos&#34;&gt;Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-objects-ufos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 1841 et seq. outline the creation and management of a comprehensive collection of government records on UFOs or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) at the National Archives (NARA), detailing the processes for assembling, preserving, and providing public access to these records, along with specific protocols for their review, disclosure, and secure handling. NARA subsequently provided guidance to federal agencies to identify, organize, and disclose UAP records for the new collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 1687 and 7343 disallow use of funds or independent research and development (IRAD) indirect expenses for UFOs or UAP unless such material and information is made available the appropriate congressional committees and congressional leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language on the topic of UFO/UAP was also included in the previous 2023 NDAA, the 2022 NDAA, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, as well as an accompanying Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report for the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foreign-extortion-prevention-act&#34;&gt;Foreign Extortion Prevention Act &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-extortion-prevention-act&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Extortion Prevention Act (FEPA) enables US authorities to prosecute foreign officials who demand or accept bribes from a US citizen, US company, or within a US jurisdiction. FEPA addresses a longstanding gap in US anti-bribery legislation by tackling the &amp;ldquo;demand&amp;rdquo; side of bribery. At the same time, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) focuses on the &amp;ldquo;supply&amp;rdquo; side of bribery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;counter-extremist-working-group-defunded&#34;&gt;Counter-extremist working group defunded &lt;a href=&#34;#counter-extremist-working-group-defunded&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans opposed the anti-extremism working group created by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. That working group had been created by Austin after it became apparent that some service members and veterans had participated in the attack on the US Capitol January 6, 2021. That working group released recommendations at the end of 2021. Implementation, however, appeared to stall as Republicans increasingly opposed diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the military, which Republicans derided as &amp;ldquo;wokeness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a recent inspector general report found dozens of troops, who appeared to be advocating violent overthrow of the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seriousness of this issue seems apparent from the fact that military and veterans have participated in other violent extremist events. For example, the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, had served with distinction in Operation Desert Storm but had earned a reputation as a sergeant for assigning undesirable work to black servicemen and using derogatory language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nato-withdrawal&#34;&gt;NATO withdrawal &lt;a href=&#34;#nato-withdrawal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1250A prevents the President from withdrawing the United States from NATO without the approval of a two-thirds Senate supermajority or an act of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;original-proposals&#34;&gt;Original proposals &lt;a href=&#34;#original-proposals&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original House bill contained provisions to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Force Personnel Management Act: Disestablish the regular Space Force in order to integrate both active duty and reserve personnel into one Space Force entity. This is to allow for better flexibility for the Space Force by replacing &amp;ldquo;active duty&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;sustained duty&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;full-time&amp;rdquo; status, and replacing &amp;ldquo;reserve&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;part-time&amp;rdquo; status. This change would only pertain to the Space Force and not to the other armed services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevate the position of vice chief of the National Guard Bureau to hold a statutory rank of general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permanently establish the titles of commissioned officer ranks of the Space Force to be the same as the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorize a $886 billion spending budget for national defense programs including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 5.2% pay increase for service members of the armed forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procurement of up to 13 &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;-class submarines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorize the sale and transfer of defense articles and services relating to the implementation of the AUKUS partnership, including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to three &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;-class submarines, one year after this act is passed, however the Navy doesn&amp;rsquo;t intend implement this until 2032.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate amendment contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP Disclosure Act: The Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act of 2023 would direct the National Archives and Records Administration to collect and disclose records on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) no later than 25 years after enactment with a presumption of immediate disclosure. The U.S. president can certify that continued postponement can be made necessary by an identifiable harm to military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations. The federal government would have eminent domain over recovered technologies of unknown origin (TUO) and biological evidence of non-human intelligence (NHI) that may be controlled by private persons or entities, such as aerospace companies. Legislation was necessary in part because UAP records had not been subject to mandatory declassification review due to exemptions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as well as an over-broad interpretation of &amp;ldquo;transclassified foreign nuclear information&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) requires people currently or formerly under contract with the federal government to make all UFO/UAP material and information and a comprehensive list of all extraterrestrial or exotic UAP material available to the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A provision that prevents the President of the United States from withdrawing the U.S. from NATO without approval of a two-thirds Senate supermajority or an act of Congress.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;area-51&#34;&gt;Area 51 &lt;a href=&#34;#area-51&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&amp;rsquo;s administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&amp;rsquo;s generally believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF and CIA acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it a frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&amp;rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. It&amp;rsquo;s located in southern Nevada, approximately 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography &lt;a href=&#34;#geography&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the physical location and surrounding areas of Area 51. The original base was a 6 by 10 mile rectangle, part of the larger &amp;ldquo;Groom box,&amp;rdquo; a 23 by 25 mile area of restricted airspace. It&amp;rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with roads leading to Mercury and Yucca Flat. Groom Lake Road runs northeast through the Jumbled Hills, past a security checkpoint, and eventually connects to State Route 375, the &amp;ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&amp;rdquo; south of Rachel, Nevada. Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, where many US nuclear tests were conducted. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is southwest of Groom Lake. Groom Lake itself is a salt flat used for runways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the name &amp;ldquo;Area 51&amp;rdquo; is uncertain. The CIA refers to the facility as Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake. Other nicknames include &amp;ldquo;Dreamland&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; The special use airspace is Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N). Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864, and mining operations occurred until the early 1950s. The airfield began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-2-program&#34;&gt;U-2 program &lt;a href=&#34;#u-2-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE, the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Project director Richard M. Bissell Jr. sought a secure testing site. Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s Kelly Johnson found Groom Lake ideal due to the dry lake bed and surrounding mountain ranges. The CIA acquired the land from the AEC, designating it &amp;ldquo;Area 51.&amp;rdquo; Johnson named the area &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; A survey team arrived in May 1955, laying out a runway and base support facility. The Ranch initially consisted of shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. By July 1955, the base had a paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and accommodations for personnel. The first U-2 delivery arrived on July 24, 1955. Regular flights were established between Area 51 and Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s Burbank offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oxcart-program&#34;&gt;OXCART program &lt;a href=&#34;#oxcart-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project OXCART was established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12. Groom Lake&amp;rsquo;s facilities were initially inadequate. Construction of &amp;ldquo;Project 51&amp;rdquo; began in September 1960, including a new 8,500 ft runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) upgraded base facilities. A 10,000 ft runway (14/32) was built, and an Archimedean spiral was marked on the dry lake as an overrun. Three Navy hangars were erected, and the original U-2 hangars were converted to maintenance shops. Facilities included workshops, storage, administration buildings, a commissary, a control tower, a fire station, and housing. A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed for the JP-7 fuel required by the A-12. Security was enhanced, and the FAA expanded the restricted airspace. The CIA facility received USAF F-101 Voodoos, T-33 Shooting Star trainers, a C-130 Hercules, a U-3A, a helicopter, a Cessna 180, and an F-104 Starfighter. The first A-12 test aircraft arrived in February 1962 and made its first flight on April 26, 1962. By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA-operated &amp;ldquo;1129th Special Activities Squadron&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;d-21-tagboard&#34;&gt;D-21 Tagboard &lt;a href=&#34;#d-21-tagboard&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of Gary Powers&amp;rsquo; U-2, discussions arose about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. The Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962, designated &amp;ldquo;Q-12,&amp;rdquo; later renamed the &amp;ldquo;D-21.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Tagboard&amp;rdquo; was the project&amp;rsquo;s code name. The D-21 was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the &amp;ldquo;M-21.&amp;rdquo; Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965. The first D-21 launch was made on March 5, 1966, with a successful flight. An accident on July 30, 1966, caused the D-21 to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft, resulting in one crew member drowning. Kelly Johnson cancelled the program. The Air Force proposed launching them from a B-52H bomber. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. The D-21B program was cancelled on July 15, 1971. The remaining drones were transferred to the Davis-Monthan AFB Military Storage and Disposition Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foreign-technology-evaluation&#34;&gt;Foreign technology evaluation &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-technology-evaluation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the United States tested and evaluated captured Soviet fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, Area 51 hosted Soviet-built aircraft. Munir Redfa&amp;rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 led to the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate their performance and capabilities, pitting them against U.S. fighters. In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in late 1967 for study. In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT. Comparisons between the F-4 and the MiG-21 indicated that the skill of the pilot was what made the difference. On August 12, 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel with a pair of MiG-17Fs. These MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers. The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed Top Gun school at NAS Miramar. In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed, and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport. Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. In 2017, a USAF aircraft crashed at the site, killing the pilot, Lt. Colonel Eric &amp;ldquo;Doc&amp;rdquo; Schultz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-bluef-117-program&#34;&gt;Have Blue/F-117 program &lt;a href=&#34;#have-bluef-117-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter first flew at Groom in December 1977. In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Development Projects. On January 17, 1981, the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full-scale development (FSD) prototype, designated YF-117A. On June 18, 1981, Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A off the runway of Area 51. Tactical Air Command (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability, the 4450th Tactical Group, which officially activated on October 15, 1979, at Nellis AFB, Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. The 4450th TG also operated the A-7D Corsair II as a surrogate trainer for the F-117A. On October 15, 1982, Major Alton C. Whitley Jr. became the&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO religions are groups that incorporate beliefs about communication with extraterrestrial beings into their religious doctrines. These groups often interpret major religions as being based on supernatural beings from heaven. Communication methods include telepathy and astral projection. A common belief is that humanity can be saved through education provided by aliens, leading to societal improvement. Alien abduction experiences can also contribute to the formation of these religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for understanding UFO religions. It highlights that these religions generally involve belief in communication with extraterrestrial beings, often through physical contact, telepathy, or astral projection. These groups typically believe that aliens will save humanity by teaching them a better way to live, sometimes by taking believers to a more positive location. UFO religions emphasize spiritual growth and the evolution of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Gordon Melton is identified as considering the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; Activity, founded by Guy Ballard, as the first UFO religion. However, Christopher Hugh Partridge views it as a theosophical religion rather than a UFO religion. Partridge emphasizes the belief within UFO religions that supreme beings originate from other planets or planes, not from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident of 1947 is identified as a key event in the history of UFO spirituality, marking the emergence of UFOs into public consciousness. UFO religion is placed within the context of theosophical esotericism and New Age thought, with many groups believing that extraterrestrial beings are heralds of a new era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, is described as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults. Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate and the Order of the Solar Temple are mentioned as controversial groups combining UFO beliefs with contactee assertions. Scientology is also discussed as a UFO religion due to its Xenu cosmogony and space opera elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;list&#34;&gt;List &lt;a href=&#34;#list&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cattle-mutilation&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilation &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle and other animals under unusual and often bloodless circumstances. The phenomenon has been linked to paranormal and supernatural explanations, as well as more mundane causes. Mutilations typically involve the removal of organs such as the eyes, tongue, and genitals. Reports of such incidents span the globe, involving various livestock and wild animals. Explanations range from natural decomposition and predation to cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. The United States has conducted two federal investigations into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-history&#34;&gt;Early History &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documented reports of unexplained livestock deaths date back to 1606 in England, where sheep were found slaughtered with only tallow and some inward parts removed. Charles Fort collected accounts of similar mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; Horse Death of 1967 &lt;a href=&#34;#the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexplained death and mutilation of a horse named &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; in Alamosa, Colorado, in 1967 brought the phenomenon to wider attention. The &lt;em&gt;Pueblo Chieftain&lt;/em&gt; published a story about the incident, detailing the horse&amp;rsquo;s skinned and defleshed head and neck, as well as precise cuts on the body. The lack of blood and a medicinal odor at the scene fueled speculation about extraterrestrial involvement. Wadsworth Ayer&amp;rsquo;s investigation for the Condon Committee concluded there was no evidence of abnormal causes. Sheriff Ben Phillips initially attributed the death to a lightning strike. Later, two students confessed to shooting the horse weeks after the incident gained publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilations 1973–1980 &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This period saw a surge in reported cattle mutilations across Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico. Unidentified helicopters were reported in connection with cattle and pig rustling in Western Iowa (April 1973) and Missouri (August 1973).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1973-kansas-wave&#34;&gt;1973 Kansas Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1973-kansas-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about suspicious phone calls from someone posing as a USDA official. Several butchered cows were subsequently found in the county, with right ears removed. Local press speculated about a &amp;ldquo;Mad Dog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;phantom&amp;rdquo; butcher. By December, law enforcement reported a wave of cattle deaths in seven counties across Kansas and Nebraska, with sexual organs removed. State Senator Ross Doyen reported a mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&amp;rsquo;s office attributed most deaths to natural causes, a conclusion disputed by Modlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1974-nebraska-wave&#34;&gt;1974 Nebraska Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1974-nebraska-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports continued in April 1974 with a mutilated and blood-drained cow in Nebraska. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations and helicopter sightings. Mutilations were reported in Mills County, Iowa, with coyotes blamed. By June, Lancaster County, Nebraska, reported mutilations. Custer County reported helicopter sightings and armed patrols. In August, an unidentified helicopter was spotted shining a spotlight over a field where a mutilated cow was later found near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported armed civilian patrols due to helicopter sightings. Cloud County Attorney William Walsh suggested devil-worshiping cultists were responsible. State Sen. John Decamp called for a coordinated investigation. By late August, 25 mutilations were reported across five Nebraska counties. A rancher near Hartington apparently thwarted a mutilation in progress when a helicopter was spotted above his field. Authorities cautioned against shooting at aircraft. In September, an autopsy revealed a supposedly-mutilated cow died of bacterial infection. Over 50 law enforcement officials attended a meeting in Center, Nebraska, estimating 27 out of 80 cow deaths were suspected mutilations. South Dakota also reported alleged mutilations. &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; became the first national outlet to cover the story, reporting 100 cattle mutilated in Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa since May. South Dakota Attorney General Kermit Sande confirmed mutilation reports in the state. UFO expert J. Allen Hynek denied any link between UFOs and mutilations. Minnesota reported mutilations in Kandiyohi, Swift, and Meeker counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1975-colorado&#34;&gt;1975 Colorado &lt;a href=&#34;#1975-colorado&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&amp;rsquo;s top story. Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI, claiming 130 mutilations in Colorado and reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing $1 million in damages. Donald E. Flickinger of the Michigan ATF investigated possible links to a &amp;ldquo;Hell-oriented biker gang.&amp;rdquo; The Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published a story examining cattle mutilations across 11 states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34;&gt;1976 Dulce, New Mexico &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1979-public-meeting&#34;&gt;1979 Public Meeting &lt;a href=&#34;#1979-public-meeting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations, attended by about 80 people. Paul Bennewitz reported seeing unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. In May, Valdez reported finding two drugs in a mutilated bull&amp;rsquo;s remains: Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) to tranquilize the animal and another to clog the blood. In June 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with radar chaff nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-incidents&#34;&gt;Later Incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#later-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many mutilation cases have been reported worldwide since 1967, primarily in the Americas and Australia. South America has seen an estimated 3,500 incidents since 2002. Investigators believe many cases go unreported. In 1993, photographic evidence surfaced of a mutilated human corpse found near the Guarapiranga reservoir of São Paulo, Brazil, in 1988. Theories ranged from homicide to alien abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cattle deaths due to natural causes are common. However, ranchers began reporting unusual deaths characterized by missing sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts were described as &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;surgical.&amp;rdquo; Some animals were reported drained of blood with no blood at the scene. Howard Burgess noted that nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. Strange marks or imprints have been found near mutilation sites. The &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; case featured an absence of tracks and small holes &amp;ldquo;punched&amp;rdquo; in the ground. In Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, a &amp;ldquo;trail of suction cup-like impressions&amp;rdquo; was found leading from a mutilated cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;laboratory-reports&#34;&gt;Laboratory Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#laboratory-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory reports on some mutilated animals have shown unusual levels of vitamins or minerals and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. However, these anomalies are not consistent across all cases. In a case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI involving a bull belonging to Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, the animal displayed &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; mutilation signs. The liver and heart were white and mushy, with the texture of peanut butter. Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory detected &lt;em&gt;Clostridium&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in the heart but could not draw conclusions. Liver samples were devoid of copper and contained high levels of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Blood samples were light pink and did not clot. The animal&amp;rsquo;s hide was brittle, and the flesh was discolored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;helicopter-sightings&#34;&gt;Helicopter Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#helicopter-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters reportedly opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. in Honey Creek, Iowa. This followed a series of alleged mutilations in the area. In August 1974, residents reported seeing unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. Know County Sheriff Herbert Thompson claimed helicopter sightings were nightly occurrences. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups. Authorities ran ads urging ranchers not to shoot at survey helicopters. The National Guard warned its helicopter pilots to fly at higher altitudes. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter. After this encounter, cattle mutilations in the region ceased for about five years. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft resembling a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-investigations&#34;&gt;Official Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#official-investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Mexico Livestock Board sought assistance from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents went undercover. Oklahoma convened a task force. Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34;&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms &lt;a href=&#34;#bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1975, the Minnesota field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) launched an investigation headed by Agent Donald Flickinger, tasked with investigating possible connections between cults and cattle mutilation. Flickinger recorded unusual incidents and circumstantial evidence but found insufficient evidence of cult involvement. His investigation was dropped when it was determined cattle deaths were not a prelude to a coordinated campaign against elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. 19 animals underwent necropsies at Colorado State University, but no conclusive results emerged. A $40,000 reward was offered. The US Bureau of Land Management&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;uncontacted-peoples&#34;&gt;Uncontacted Peoples &lt;a href=&#34;#uncontacted-peoples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncontacted peoples are Indigenous groups who live without sustained contact with neighboring communities and the world community. They choose to remain isolated, and are referred to as indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. Estimates suggest there are between 100 and 200 uncontacted tribes, totaling up to 10,000 individuals, primarily located in South America, especially northern Brazil. Knowledge about these groups is mainly gathered from neighboring Indigenous communities and aerial footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition&#34;&gt;Definition &lt;a href=&#34;#definition&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;uncontacted peoples&amp;rdquo; refers to Indigenous groups who have remained largely isolated, maintaining their traditional lifestyles independently from political or governmental entities. While most Indigenous groups have had some form of contact due to European exploration and colonization, &amp;ldquo;uncontacted&amp;rdquo; signifies a lack of sustained contact with the majority of non-Indigenous society today. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights calls them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; defined by their rejection of contact with outsiders, including those who previously had contact but chose to return to isolation. These groups are viewed as contemporaries of modernity, not relics of the past. A 2009 United Nations report also includes &amp;ldquo;peoples in initial contact&amp;rdquo; who are beginning to integrate into mainstream society. International organizations emphasize their agency by calling them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in isolation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; also known as &amp;ldquo;hidden peoples&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uncontacted tribes.&amp;rdquo; Historically, European colonial ideas about uncontacted peoples were influenced by the search for Prester John and the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying them as &amp;ldquo;lost tribes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relations-with-outsiders&#34;&gt;Relations with Outsiders &lt;a href=&#34;#relations-with-outsiders&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International organizations emphasize protecting indigenous peoples&amp;rsquo; lands and environment, preventing exploitation and abuse, and avoiding contact to prevent the spread of modern diseases. Historic exploitation has led governments to grant legal protection and land rights to uncontacted peoples, such as in the Vale do Javari in Brazil and North Sentinel Island in India. In 1961, British explorer Richard Mason was killed by the Panará tribe. Contact in 1973, when the BR-163 road was built through their territory, led to disease and environmental degradation, killing over 250 of the 350 Panará members within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contention often arises from governments&amp;rsquo; desire to extract natural resources. In Brazil, the government attempted assimilation in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was created, securing protected lands. In Colombia, contact with the Nukak tribe by an evangelical group led to respiratory infections, clashes with drug traffickers, and the death of over half the tribe, resulting in government relocation and poverty. Exploitation for lumbering, ranching, oil prospecting, and poaching poses significant dangers. Former Peruvian President Alan García claimed uncontacted groups were a &amp;ldquo;fabrication of environmentalists.&amp;rdquo; In 2016, a Chinese mining subsidiary in Bolivia ignored signs of encroaching on uncontacted tribes. Missionaries can also cause great damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Acre Indians contacted the Brazilian government due to threats from cocaine traffickers, indicating awareness of the outside world and strategic decisions to avoid contact. Satellite images show tribes migrating away from roads and logging. Indigenous rights activists advocate for leaving isolated peoples alone to protect their self-determination. FUNAI collaborates with experts to make controlled initial contact, operating trading posts for metal tools and cooking instruments, preventing conflicts, and delivering vaccinations. However, FUNAI reported receiving only 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, FUNAI released videos and images of tribes to raise public awareness and protect them from commercial pressures, investigating a possible mass homicide against the Flecheiros tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Human Rights Council (2009) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (2013) introduced guidelines including the right to choose self-isolation. Reports of &amp;ldquo;human safaris&amp;rdquo; in India&amp;rsquo;s Andaman Islands and the Peruvian Amazon, where tourists seek to view uncontacted peoples, are controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;by-region&#34;&gt;By Region &lt;a href=&#34;#by-region&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sentinelese&#34;&gt;Sentinelese &lt;a href=&#34;#sentinelese&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sentinelese people of North Sentinel Island reject contact, often with lethal force. Their language differs significantly from other Andaman languages, suggesting millennia of isolation. Experts consider them the most isolated people in the world. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997. In 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary, was killed while illegally visiting the island. In 2025, a US citizen was arrested for making an unauthorized landing on the island. Survival International condemned these actions, noting the vulnerability of uncontacted peoples to contact-induced diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shompen&#34;&gt;Shompen &lt;a href=&#34;#shompen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shompen are the Indigenous people of Great Nicobar Island, with an estimated population of 300 in 2001. They practice a hunter-gatherer economy. Survival International identifies them as one of the most isolated peoples, with most refusing interactions with outsiders. The proposed Great Nicobar Development Plan, including an airport, international port, and industrial park, threatens their way of life. In February 2024, 39 genocide experts warned that the development would be a &amp;ldquo;death sentence&amp;rdquo; for the Shompen due to increased population and exposure to outside diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;south-america&#34;&gt;South America &lt;a href=&#34;#south-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Toromona are an uncontacted people living near the Madidi and Heath Rivers. The government has created a protected area within Madidi National Park for them. Among the Ayoreo people of the Gran Chaco, a small number of uncontacted nomadic hunter-gatherers reside in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park. Pacahuaras are believed to be living in voluntary isolation in Pando Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brazil&#34;&gt;Brazil &lt;a href=&#34;#brazil&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the 1970s, Brazil attempted to move people on commercially cultivatable lands. In 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was established, and the Vale do Javari was declared perpetually sealed off. In 2007, FUNAI reported 67 uncontacted Indigenous peoples, up from 40 in 2005. The Awá people live in the eastern Amazon rainforest, with approximately 350 members, 100 of whom are uncontacted. Their tribe is at risk due to conflicts with logging interests. The Kawahiva live in northern Mato Grosso, constantly moving and known primarily from physical evidence. In 2013, the government released video of the Kawahiva filmed in 2011. In 2025, FUNAI confirmed that the demarcation of the Kawahiva do Rio Pardo territory will happen by the end of 2025. The Korubu live in the lower Vale do Javari. The Flecheiros (&amp;ldquo;arrow people&amp;rdquo;) also live in the Vale do Javari. Other tribes may include the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and the Himarimã.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, two brothers of the Piripkura tribe initiated contact with FUNAI after their fire went out, becoming the focus of the documentary &lt;em&gt;Piripkura&lt;/em&gt;. Another man, the &amp;ldquo;Man of the Hole,&amp;rdquo; lived alone on 8,000 hectares, digging hundreds of holes. He was found dead in his dwelling in August 2022. Since 2021, uncontacted peoples in Brazil have been threatened by illegal land grabbers, loggers, and gold miners. The government of Jair Bolsonaro signaled its intention to develop the Amazon and reduce Indigenous reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;colombia&#34;&gt;Colombia &lt;a href=&#34;#colombia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is regarded as offering maximum protection to uncontacted Indigenous people through tribal reserves and strict patrolling. The Nukak people are nomadic hunter-gatherers living between the Guaviare and Inírida rivers. Groups, including the Carabayo, Yuri, and Passé, reside in Río Puré National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ecuador&#34;&gt;Ecuador &lt;a href=&#34;#ecuador&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two isolated Indigenous peoples of Ecuador live in the Amazon region: the Tagaeri and the Taromenane, both eastern Huaorani peoples living in Yasuni National Park. These semi-nomadic people live in small groups, subsisting on hunting, gathering, and some crops. Since 2007, national policy mandates untouchability, self-determination, equality, and no contact. In 2013, more than 20 Taromenane were killed by Waorani, another Huaorani group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paraguay&#34;&gt;Paraguay &lt;a href=&#34;#paraguay&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 100 Ayoreo people, some of whom are in the Totobiegosode tribe, live uncontacted in the forest. They are nomadic hunter-gatherers in Amotocodie. They are the last uncontacted peoples south of the Amazon Basin, threatened by illegal deforestation. Brazilian company Yaguarete Porá S.A. is converting their ancestral territory into cattle ranching land. The Union of Ayoreo Natives of Paraguay is working for their protection, with support from the Iniciativa Amotocodie. In 2021, the Ayoreo appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to save their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;peru&#34;&gt;Peru &lt;a href=&#34;#peru&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nomole (Mashco-Piro) are nomadic Arawak-speaking hunter-gatherers who inhabit Manú National Park. In 1998, their number was estimated at 100 to 250. They speak a dialect of the Piro languages. Amid incursions on their land, the tribe has made it clear they do not wish to be contacted. In July 2024, video and images of dozens of uncontact&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; which are names given in ufology to humanoid races purportedly from the Pleiades star cluster. These beings are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans, with features like tall stature (6-7 ft), blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention pale-blue/grey or pastel purple skin tones. George Adamski is noted as one of the first to report contact with these beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding them often includes telepathy, benevolence, and physical beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the historical context and cultural influences related to the Nordic alien phenomenon. David J. Skal suggests that the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; may have inspired early stories. Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; associating Nordic aliens with spiritual growth and protection. These aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned with Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal and youthful. While popular in the 1950s, claims of encounters became less common as the grey alien archetype rose to prominence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alleged-humanoid-extraterrestrials&#34;&gt;Alleged humanoid extraterrestrials &lt;a href=&#34;#alleged-humanoid-extraterrestrials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; a type of humanoid extraterrestrial beings often discussed in ufology. These beings are said to originate from the Pleiades star cluster and are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans. They are typically depicted as taller than average humans (6-7 ft), with blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention skin tones of pale blue/grey or pastel purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Adamski, a Polish-American ufologist, is noted as one of the first to publicly claim contact with Nordic beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding these beings often includes themes of telepathy, benevolence, beauty, and grace. Telepathy is often described as the primary form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context and cultural influences surrounding the Nordic alien narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural historian David J. Skal suggests that the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; may have inspired early stories of Nordic-type aliens. The film features an extraterrestrial arriving on Earth to warn humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bates College professor Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; noting that Nordic aliens are often associated with spiritual growth, love, and protection among believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of encounters with Nordic aliens were common in Europe during the 1950s but became less frequent in later decades, as the grey alien became more prevalent in extraterrestrial encounter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publications-by-those-claiming-to-have-been-contacted&#34;&gt;Publications by those claiming to have been contacted &lt;a href=&#34;#publications-by-those-claiming-to-have-been-contacted&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-seti&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-seti&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) encompasses various scientific projects aimed at detecting signals or evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth. These efforts involve monitoring electromagnetic radiation, searching for optical signals, and investigating potential extraterrestrial artifacts. Some initiatives, like NASA&amp;rsquo;s Golden Record, have also attempted to send messages to hypothetical alien civilizations. Despite decades of searching, no confirmed evidence of alien intelligence has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the historical progression of SETI efforts, from early speculations to modern scientific projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-work&#34;&gt;Early Work &lt;a href=&#34;#early-work&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early searches for extraterrestrial intelligence within the Solar System are highlighted. Nikola Tesla suggested using his wireless electrical transmission system to contact beings on Mars in 1896. In 1899, he thought he detected a signal from Mars at his Colorado Springs experimental station. Guglielmo Marconi, Lord Kelvin, and David Peck Todd also believed radio could be used to contact Martians in the early 1900s. In 1924, during a close opposition of Mars, the United States observed a &amp;ldquo;National Radio Silence Day&amp;rdquo; to listen for Martian signals, with William F. Friedman assigned to translate any potential messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-ozma-and-early-radio-astronomy&#34;&gt;Project Ozma and Early Radio Astronomy &lt;a href=&#34;#project-ozma-and-early-radio-astronomy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of searching the microwave spectrum was first pointed out in a 1959 paper by Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi. In 1960, Frank Drake performed the first modern SETI experiment, Project Ozma, at Green Bank, West Virginia, examining the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. Soviet scientists also took a strong interest in SETI during the 1960s. Iosif Shklovsky wrote the book &lt;em&gt;Universe, Life, Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; (1962), which was expanded upon by Carl Sagan as &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966). John D. Kraus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Ear&amp;rdquo; radio telescope at Ohio State University began the world&amp;rsquo;s first continuous SETI program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-cyclops-and-the-wow-signal&#34;&gt;Project Cyclops and the Wow! Signal &lt;a href=&#34;#project-cyclops-and-the-wow-signal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, NASA funded a SETI study that proposed the construction of an Earth-based radio telescope array with 1,500 dishes known as Project Cyclops. The project was not built, but the report formed the basis of much SETI work that followed. The Ohio State SETI program gained fame on August 15, 1977, when Jerry Ehman witnessed a strong signal, the Wow! signal, which is considered by some to be the best candidate for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source ever discovered. In May 2023, a test extraterrestrial signal was transmitted to radio telescopes on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sentinel-meta-and-beta&#34;&gt;Sentinel, META, and BETA &lt;a href=&#34;#sentinel-meta-and-beta&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman founded the U.S. Planetary Society, partly as a vehicle for SETI studies. In the early 1980s, Harvard University physicist Paul Horowitz proposed the design of a spectrum analyzer specifically intended to search for SETI transmissions. This work led to &amp;ldquo;Suitcase SETI&amp;rdquo; in 1981, followed by Project META in 1985, and Project BETA in 1995. On March 23, 1999, the 26-meter radio telescope on which Sentinel, META and BETA were based was blown over by strong winds and seriously damaged, forcing the BETA project to cease operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mop-and-project-phoenix&#34;&gt;MOP and Project Phoenix &lt;a href=&#34;#mop-and-project-phoenix&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, the NASA SETI program was heavily criticized by Senator William Proxmire, and funding for SETI research was removed from the NASA budget by Congress in 1981. In 1992, the U.S. government funded an operational SETI program, in the form of the NASA Microwave Observing Program (MOP). MOP was canceled one year after its start. In 1995, the SETI Institute resurrected the MOP program under the name of Project Phoenix, under the direction of Jill Tarter. From 1995 through March 2004, Phoenix conducted observations at the Parkes radio telescope in Australia, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ongoing-radio-searches&#34;&gt;Ongoing Radio Searches &lt;a href=&#34;#ongoing-radio-searches&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the current state of radio-based SETI projects and the rationale behind focusing on radio frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many radio frequencies penetrate Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere well, leading to the development of radio telescopes. Human endeavors emit considerable electromagnetic radiation, which could be recognizable as artificial signals. Earth has been sending radio waves into space for over 100 years, reaching over 1,000 stars. Many international radio telescopes are currently being used for radio SETI searches, including the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Australia, and the Lovell Telescope in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;allen-telescope-array&#34;&gt;Allen Telescope Array &lt;a href=&#34;#allen-telescope-array&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SETI Institute collaborated with the Radio Astronomy Laboratory at the Berkeley SETI Research Center to develop the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). The array has 42 operational dishes at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in rural northern California. The SETI Institute&amp;rsquo;s Center for SETI Research (CSR) uses ATA in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, observing 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Berkeley astronomers used the ATA to pursue several science topics until 2011, when the collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley and the SETI Institute was terminated. In 2012, the ATA was revitalized with a donation by Franklin Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;serendip&#34;&gt;SERENDIP &lt;a href=&#34;#serendip&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SERENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) is a SETI program launched in 1979 by the Berkeley SETI Research Center. SERENDIP analyzes deep space radio telescope data that it obtains while other astronomers are using the telescopes. The most recently deployed SERENDIP spectrometer, SERENDIP VI, was installed at both the Arecibo Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope in 2014–2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breakthrough-listen&#34;&gt;Breakthrough Listen &lt;a href=&#34;#breakthrough-listen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breakthrough Listen&lt;/em&gt; is a ten-year initiative with $100 million funding begun in July 2015 to actively search for intelligent extraterrestrial communications in the universe. The science program for Breakthrough Listen is based at Berkeley SETI Research Center. The project is observing for thousands of hours every year on two major radio telescopes, the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, and the Parkes Observatory in Australia. Frank Drake was one of the scientists on the project&amp;rsquo;s advisory committee. In October 2019, Breakthrough Listen started a collaboration with scientists from the TESS team to look for signs of advanced extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fast&#34;&gt;FAST &lt;a href=&#34;#fast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s 500 meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) lists &lt;em&gt;detecting interstellar communication signals&lt;/em&gt; as part of its science mission. FAST is the first radio observatory built with SETI as a core scientific goal. On 14 June 2022, astronomers, working with China&amp;rsquo;s FAST telescope, reported the possibility of having detected artificial signals, but cautioned that further studies were required to determine if a natural radio interference may be the source. Dan Werthimer noted, &amp;ldquo;These signals are from radio interference; they are due to radio pollution from earthlings, not from E.T.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ucla&#34;&gt;UCLA &lt;a href=&#34;#ucla&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) undergraduate and graduate students have been participating in radio searches for technosignatures with the Green Bank Telescope. Targets include the Kepler field, TRAPPIST-1, and solar-type stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;community-seti-projects&#34;&gt;Community SETI Projects &lt;a href=&#34;#community-seti-projects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights SETI projects that rely on the contributions of volunteers and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setihome&#34;&gt;SETI@home &lt;a href=&#34;#setihome&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SETI@home project used volunteer computing to analyze signals acquired by the SERENDIP project. The SETI@home project was launched by the Berkeley SETI Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, in May 1999. The project is run by director David P. Anderson and chief scientist Dan Werthimer. On March 31, 2020, the project stopped sending out new work to SETI@home users, bringing this particular SETI effort to an indefinite hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seti-net&#34;&gt;SETI Net &lt;a href=&#34;#seti-net&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SETI Network was the only fully operational private search system. SETI Net started operation in the early 1980s as a way to learn about the science of the search, and developed several software packages for the amateur SETI community. SETI Net went dark and was decommissioned on 2021-12-04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-seti-league-and-project-argus&#34;&gt;The SETI League and Project Argus &lt;a href=&#34;#the-seti-league-and-project-argus&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1994 in response to the United States Congress cancellation of the NASA SETI program, The SETI League, Incorporated is a membership-supported nonprofit organization. This grass-roots alliance of amateur and professional radio astronomers is headed by executive director emeritus H. Paul Shuch. The organization concentrates on coordinating a global network of small, amateur-built radio telescopes under Project Argus, an all-sky survey seeking to achieve real-time coverage of the entire sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optical-experiments&#34;&gt;Optical Experiments &lt;a href=&#34;#optical-experiments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extraterrestrial intelligence using optical wavelengths, such as lasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some SETI researchers have considered the possibility that alien civilizations might be using powerful lasers for interstellar communications at optical wavelengths. There are two problems with optical SETI: lasers are highly &amp;ldquo;monochromatic&amp;rdquo;, and lasers are highly directional&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no such life has been conclusively detected, it could range from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The science dedicated to studying extraterrestrial life is astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a framework for understanding the topic of life in the universe. It outlines various aspects, including planetary habitability within and outside the Solar System, and lists celestial bodies like Venus, Mars, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan as potential locations for life. It also mentions the habitability of binary star systems, natural satellites, neutron star systems, red dwarf systems, K-type, yellow dwarf, and F-type main-sequence star systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the debate on whether extraterrestrial life is common or rare. It presents the argument for ubiquitous life, citing the size and age of the universe, the abundance of life&amp;rsquo;s chemical elements, and the universality of physical laws. Scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view, which is rooted in the Copernican and mediocrity principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the Rare Earth hypothesis suggests that life on Earth is due to a unique combination of factors, making extraterrestrial life, especially multicellular life, rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation considers factors like the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planets, and the likelihood of life evolving intelligence and developing communication technology. However, the section notes the controversy surrounding the Drake equation due to the speculative nature of its variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fermi paradox, the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for them, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the potential biochemical requirements for extraterrestrial life. It states that life requires an environment with non-equilibrium thermodynamics, such as energy from stars, volcanoes, or hydrothermal vents. Liquid water is considered essential as a solvent for biochemical reactions, although alternatives like ammonia or liquid hydrocarbons are mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also explores alternative chemical elements that could form the basis of life, such as silicon, while acknowledging carbon&amp;rsquo;s versatility. It discusses the potential for radically different biochemistries, the role of natural selection, and the likelihood of cell membranes. Simon Conway Morris is mentioned for his views on convergent evolution leading to similar lifeforms as on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34;&gt;Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life &lt;a href=&#34;#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights that while conditions on other planets may seem too extreme to harbor life, some of the earliest life forms on Earth originated in extreme environments. Hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs are mentioned as possible origins of life on Earth. These environments support chemosynthetic processes, allowing organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon. The section suggests that similar processes could occur on other planets with reducing atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34;&gt;Planetary Habitability in the Solar System &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the potential for life on various bodies within our Solar System. Besides Earth, Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most likely candidates. Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that evolved differently from Earth. Mars is considered potentially habitable in the past, with the possibility of fossilized remains or surviving microbes underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are mentioned as having subsurface oceans, with Europa being the most promising due to contact between its ocean and rocky surface. Enceladus is noted for its eruption columns releasing water into space, containing complex organic molecules, salts, and evidence of hydrothermal activity. Titan is unique for having liquid bodies of hydrocarbons on its surface, raising speculation about lifeforms with different biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-search&#34;&gt;Scientific Search &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-search&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces astrobiology as the science dedicated to searching for and studying life in the universe. It mentions the direct and indirect methods used, including the identification of thousands of exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-basic-life&#34;&gt;Search for Basic Life &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-basic-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for biosignatures within the Solar System and beyond. It mentions claims of evidence for microbial life on Mars, including structures resembling nanobacteria in the ALH84001 meteorite. The Viking Mars landers&amp;rsquo; gas emission experiments are discussed, along with NASA&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; rover&amp;rsquo;s mission to assess past and present habitability on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Cornell University are creating a catalog of microorganisms and their reactions to sunlight to aid in the search for similar organisms on exoplanets. The discovery of organic molecules in meteorites found in Antarctica is also mentioned, suggesting that building blocks of life may be generated within asteroids and comets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection of glycolaldehyde, a sugar molecule needed to form RNA, in a distant star system is highlighted as evidence that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to planet formation. The discovery of hydrogen cyanide in the plumes of Enceladus is also mentioned as a possible chemical essential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) through the detection of technosignatures, such as interstellar communications, atmospheric effects, and planetary-sized structures. Organizations like the SETI Institute are searching for radio waves and laser pulses. The use of artificial intelligence to analyze data is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential technosignatures include nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons, and light pollution. The Kardashev scale is introduced, suggesting that advanced civilizations may consume energy directly from their local star, creating detectable infrared radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extrasolar-planets&#34;&gt;Extrasolar Planets &lt;a href=&#34;#extrasolar-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for exoplanets that may be conducive to life, particularly terrestrial planets within habitable zones. It mentions the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, ranging in size from Earth-like to gas giants. The Kepler space telescope&amp;rsquo;s role in detecting candidate planets is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section notes that there is at least one planet on average per star, and about 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. Proxima Centauri b is mentioned as the nearest known exoplanet. The study of planetary habitability considers various factors in determining a planet&amp;rsquo;s suitability for hosting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-and-cultural-impact&#34;&gt;History and Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#history-and-cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical and cultural context of the extraterrestrial life debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosmic-pluralism&#34;&gt;Cosmic Pluralism &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-pluralism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the philosophical belief in numerous worlds beyond Earth that might harbor life. It traces the concept back to ancient Greek thinkers like Anaximander, Epicurus, and Aristotle. Epicurus believed that other worlds with their own animals and plants should exist, while Aristotle thought Earth was the only planet in the universe. Medieval Muslim writers like Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Baqir are mentioned for supporting cosmic pluralism based on the Qur&amp;rsquo;an.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-modern-period&#34;&gt;Early Modern Period &lt;a href=&#34;#early-modern-period&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the shift in understanding the cosmos during the Copernican Revolution. Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that planets revolve around the sun, Johannes Kepler discovered that orbits were ellipses, and Galileo Galilei&amp;rsquo;s telescope provided further evidence. Giordano Bruno argued for an infinite universe with every star surrounded by its own planetary system. Isaac Newton&amp;rsquo;s theory of gravity further strengthened the heliocentric model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;19th-century&#34;&gt;19th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#19th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the increased speculation about life on Mars in the late 19th century, fueled by telescopic observations of apparent Martian canals. Percival Lowell published books proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization. Spectroscopic analysis by William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the Martian atmosphere. Louis Pasteur disproved the theory of spontaneous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recent-history&#34;&gt;Recent History &lt;a href=&#34;#recent-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the emergence of astrobiology as a science. It mentions the influence of science fiction on popular perception and the emergence of pseudosciences like ufology and the ancient astronauts hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis White Beck&amp;rsquo;s analysis of philosophical thought on extraterrestrial life is mentioned. The section notes that while no extraterrestrial life has been found, scientific reasons and technological advances suggest that it can exist elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Drake&amp;rsquo;s optimism about finding alien life is contrasted with Jacques Monod&amp;rsquo;s pessimism. Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee&amp;rsquo;s Rare Earth hypothesis is introduced, claiming that Earth-like life is rare in the universe. Stephen Hawking warned against contacting alien life forms, citing the potential for exploitation. Yuri Milner and the SETI Institute launched the Breakthrough Initiatives to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;government-responses&#34;&gt;Government Responses &lt;a href=&#34;#government-responses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses government policies related to extraterrestrial life. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement define rules of planetary protection. COSPAR also provides guidelines for planetary protection. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs discussed strategies for interacting with extraterrestrial life, but ended without conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is mentioned for its mission to prevent backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life. The Chinese government&amp;rsquo;s space program includes the search for extraterrestrial life. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency, stated that the search for extraterrestrial life is a main goal of deep space research. The French space agency (CNES) has an office for the study of &amp;ldquo;non-identified aero spatial phenomena&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-fiction&#34;&gt;In Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the portrayal of extraterrestrials in fiction. Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s theory of evolution influenced science fiction authors to create bizarre aliens distinct from humans. The Barney and Betty Hill incident, the first recorded claim of an alien abduction, influenced the grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ancient-astronauts&#34;&gt;Ancient Astronauts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-astronauts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected the development of cultures, technologies, religions, and even human biology. A common idea is that deities in many religions were actually extraterrestrials, and their advanced technologies were seen as divine powers by early humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is rejected by academics and archaeologists, who consider it pseudoarchaeology and unscientific. Claims are often based on distorted or fabricated evidence. Some critics argue that ancient astronaut theories have racist implications, diminishing the achievements of indigenous cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable proponents in the late 20th century include Robert Charroux, Jacques Bergier, Jean Sendy, Erich von Däniken, Alexander Kazantsev, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, David Hatcher Childress, Peter Kolosimo, and Mauro Biglino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers often claim that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence that landed on Earth in the past. They suggest that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these ancient alien visitors, who acted as a &amp;ldquo;mother culture.&amp;rdquo; Proponents also claim that extraterrestrials built or helped humans build structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island. Evidence is said to come from gaps in historical and archaeological records, as well as artifacts that are considered anachronistic and beyond the technical capabilities of ancient people. These &amp;ldquo;out-of-place artifacts&amp;rdquo; include artwork and legends reinterpreted to support extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is featured in fringe media, such as the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The show mixes fact with fiction to promote theories of an alternate past, often incorporating white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents portray themselves as an oppressed minority of academics challenging mainstream archaeology, despite lacking credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like past archaeological endeavors, the focus is on monumental structures, suggesting that indigenous people could not have built them without alien help. However, some indigenous voices argue that ancient alien theory supports their stories of extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme is the portrayal of aliens as light-skinned or Aryan, as claimed by Erich von Däniken. Some proponents are associated with white supremacism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream archaeologists have largely ignored these claims, while popular science explainers and skeptics have criticized them. Carl Sagan noted that cases of apparent interest have reasonable alternative explanations, misreporting, or are hoaxes and distortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34;&gt;History of Ancient Aliens Beliefs and Their Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleocontact narratives appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt; (1898) and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It gained popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and Erich von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s works. Critics emerged in the 1970s, discrediting Von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s claims. By the early 1980s, support dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shklovskii-and-sagan&#34;&gt;Shklovskii and Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#shklovskii-and-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan co-authored &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966) with Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky. In &lt;em&gt;Broca&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1979), Sagan expressed disapproval of writers like von Däniken who treated speculations as valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact. Sagan noted that many legends, artifacts, and out-of-place artifacts cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses could be explained with conventional hypotheses. He reiterated that extraterrestrial visits were possible but unproven and improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;erich-von-däniken&#34;&gt;Erich von Däniken &lt;a href=&#34;#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erich von Däniken became a leading proponent in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his book &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; (1968) and its sequels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken argued that certain artifacts required more advanced technology than was available to ancient cultures. He claimed that these artifacts were constructed by extraterrestrial visitors or humans who learned from them. Examples include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote that ancient art and iconography depict air and space vehicles, intelligent non-human creatures, ancient astronauts, and advanced technology. He also stated that geographically separated cultures share artistic themes, implying a common origin. One example is his interpretation of the sarcophagus lid from the tomb of Pacal the Great in Palenque, which he saw as a seated astronaut, while Maya texts identify it as a portrait of the ruler with the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken interpreted the origins of many religions as reactions to encounters with an alien race, whose technology was seen as supernatural. He stated that religious traditions contain references to alien visitors, such as Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s revelation, which he interpreted as a landing spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. through the NBC-TV documentary &lt;em&gt;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; and the film &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, made unfounded claims, and failed to validate his core claims. Christian creationists also criticized his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Nazca Lines, von Däniken stated that they resembled an airfield when seen from the air. Kenneth L. Feder argues that readers seeing the Nazca Lines in a book about aliens would be more likely to associate them with extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, von Däniken admitted that the Nazca markings could have been laid out using a system of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Earth Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; series revolves around his interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts. He hypothesized that the gods of Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet Nibiru, which the Sumerians believed to be a remote &amp;ldquo;12th planet&amp;rdquo; associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru orbits the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin argued that Sumerian texts tell the story of 50 Anunnaki from Nibiru who came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago to mine raw materials, especially gold. They genetically engineered laborers, creating &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/em&gt;: the &amp;ldquo;Adapa&amp;rdquo; or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended that the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the end of the last ice age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been criticized by professionals. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s translations are inconsistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan F. Alford, author of &lt;em&gt;Gods of the New Millennium&lt;/em&gt;, initially adhered to Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses but later found fault, stating that the gods personified the falling sky and that the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;robert-temple&#34;&gt;Robert Temple &lt;a href=&#34;#robert-temple&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert K. G. Temple&amp;rsquo;s 1976 book, &lt;em&gt;The Sirius Mystery,&lt;/em&gt; argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He cites advanced astronomical knowledge, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations. His work draws on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies and suggest that the Dogon may have received their astronomical information recently from European sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various new religious movements, including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, Raëlism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate, believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many see ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities suggesting that members associate enchantment with science fiction memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;claims-of-proponents&#34;&gt;Claims of Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#claims-of-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; cited as evidence can be explained without invoking ancient astronauts. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ancient-religious-texts&#34;&gt;Ancient Religious Texts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-religious-texts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents cite ancient mythologies, suggesting that creation myths of gods descending from the heavens to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors. They draw an analogy to cargo cults, where isolated cultures believed Western ships and cargo were sent from the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Sumerian myth of &lt;em&gt;Enûma Eliš&lt;/em&gt; says humankind was created to serve gods called the &amp;ldquo;Annunaki.&amp;rdquo; Proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to Earth to mine gold and created the human race as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ramayana&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ramayana&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel in flying vehicles called Vimana. The &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; mentions these flying objects, used by the Lankan king Ravana from Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples from the &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; include descriptions of the Pushpak chariot, a&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;roswell-that-ends-well&#34;&gt;Roswell That Ends Well &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-that-ends-well&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roswell That Ends Well&amp;rdquo; is the 19th episode of the third season of the animated television series &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;. It originally aired on December 9, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planet Express crew, while observing a supernova, accidentally time travel to 1947 after Fry microwaves a metal pan of popcorn. They crash-land in Roswell, New Mexico, becoming part of the Roswell Incident. Bender is shattered upon impact. The crew searches for a way back to the 31st century. Zoidberg is captured by the U.S. military and experimented on at Roswell Air Base. The military reconstructs Bender&amp;rsquo;s body into a flying saucer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew needs a microwave oven to return to their time. Professor Farnsworth warns Fry against interacting with his grandfather, Enos, to avoid a grandfather paradox. Fry tries to protect Enos, but Enos dies in a nuclear weapon test. Fry sleeps with Mildred, Enos&amp;rsquo;s fiancée, and realizes she is his grandmother, making him his own grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew storms Roswell Air Base to steal a microwave dish. Fry and Leela rescue Zoidberg from an alien autopsy. Farnsworth retrieves Bender&amp;rsquo;s body. While time jumping, Bender&amp;rsquo;s head is left behind. Back in the 31st century, the crew returns to Roswell, finds Bender&amp;rsquo;s head, and reattaches it to his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing team developed the episode from ideas initially considered for &amp;ldquo;Anthology of Interest II.&amp;rdquo; The writers initially avoided time travel in &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;, but changed their minds. They made the time travel unintentional, triggered by a supernova, to avoid regular time travel. The episode was directed by Rich Moore, who used screen position and character movement to represent time travel. Actions to the left represented the past, while actions to the right indicated progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-references&#34;&gt;Cultural references &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode references time travel stories like &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;rods-optical-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Rods (Optical Phenomenon) &lt;a href=&#34;#rods-optical-phenomenon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rods, also known as skyfish, air rods, or solar entities, are elongated visual artifacts that appear in photographic images and video recordings. While cryptozoologists and ufologists consider them paranormal, most optical analyses conclude they are insects moving across the frame during capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optical-analysis&#34;&gt;Optical Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#optical-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the scientific explanations for the &amp;ldquo;rod&amp;rdquo; phenomenon. Robert Todd Carroll, consulting with entomologist Doug Yanega, identified rods as images of flying insects captured over several wing-beating cycles on video. This creates the illusion of a single, elongated body. A report by &amp;ldquo;The Straight Dope&amp;rdquo; also attributes rods to tricks of light and motion blur due to long exposure times when recording flying insects. The section emphasizes that claims of extraordinary or alien origins are often attributed to imagination or hoaxes. China Central Television (CCTV) aired a documentary debunking rods, revealing them to be ordinary insects captured by surveillance cameras. Scientists at Tonghua Zhenguo Pharmaceutical Company in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, captured &amp;ldquo;rods&amp;rdquo; in nets, finding them to be moths and other insects. UFO investigator Robert Sheaffer, after attending a lecture by Jose Escamilla, concluded that some &amp;ldquo;rods&amp;rdquo; were insects moving rapidly, while others were blurred bird wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;paranormal-claims&#34;&gt;Paranormal Claims &lt;a href=&#34;#paranormal-claims&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the paranormal interpretations of rods, particularly those promoted by Jose Escamilla. Escamilla claimed to have filmed the first rods on March 19, 1994, in Roswell, New Mexico, while attempting to film a UFO. He subsequently created videos and gave lectures promoting his claims of rods being alien life forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section contains a footnote clarifying that claims of rods being extraordinary creatures are often exploited by unscrupulous individuals for profit, according to &amp;ldquo;Straight Dope&amp;rdquo; staff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-contact-anthropology&#34;&gt;First Contact (Anthropology) &lt;a href=&#34;#first-contact-anthropology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact, in anthropology, refers to the initial meeting between two communities that were previously unaware of each other. This phenomenon is often associated with significant cultural and societal impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consequences&#34;&gt;Consequences &lt;a href=&#34;#consequences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cultures with vastly different technological advancements meet, the more technologically advanced society often has a disruptive advantage. This can lead to dire consequences for the less advanced society. Disease transmission also plays a critical role, as isolated populations often lack immunity to illnesses carried by the more urbanized society. The relative sizes of the populations involved can also influence intercultural development. Outcomes of first contact can range from social integration and colonization to elimination (genocide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before contemporary instances of contact with uncontacted peoples, many communities and states were isolated from each other, possessing limited knowledge of one another. The limited formal contact between Europe and China via the Silk Road and later with the Mongol Empire is one such example. European powers, such as Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, sought to reach Greater India, leading to the mistaken identification of the Americas as the West Indies and the indigenous peoples of the Americas as &amp;ldquo;Indians.&amp;rdquo; This &amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; has been criticized as one-sided and has parallels in contemporary narratives of first contact beyond Earth, such as the Pioneer plaque. Colonialism often used first contact as a means to control knowledge and representation of &amp;ldquo;the other,&amp;rdquo; objectifying contact and its place on the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-examples&#34;&gt;Notable Examples &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-examples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous instances of first contact have occurred throughout history, including Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s invasions from Persia to India in 330 BC and the establishment of Romano-Chinese relations in the 2nd century AD. However, well-established trade routes meant that many cultures were aware of each other before they met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specific examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~1000:&lt;/strong&gt; Vikings, led by Leif Erikson, established a settlement at L&amp;rsquo;Anse Aux Meadows (present-day Canada) and encountered the Beothuk people (referred to as Skræling). The nature of this contact (peaceful or violent) is debated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 October 1492:&lt;/strong&gt; Christopher Columbus&amp;rsquo;s first voyage led to contact between the Spanish Empire and the Taíno, Galibi, and Ciboney peoples in the West Indies. This contact was violent and resulted in numerous deaths, enslavement, and subjugation of the indigenous inhabitants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 June 1579:&lt;/strong&gt; Francis Drake&amp;rsquo;s circumnavigation brought the English into contact with the Coast Miwok in Northern California. Relations remained peaceful during Drake&amp;rsquo;s month-long stay, during which he claimed the land for England as Nova Albion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 July 1595:&lt;/strong&gt; Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira led a Spanish expedition to the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), resulting in initial friendly contact with the Polynesians that quickly turned violent, leading to 200 local deaths in the first two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 December 1642:&lt;/strong&gt; Abel Tasman&amp;rsquo;s first voyage led to contact between the Dutch and the Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri in New Zealand. The encounter resulted in the death of four Dutch and the wounding of one Māori, with no further communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 January 1788:&lt;/strong&gt; James Cook&amp;rsquo;s third voyage brought the British into contact with the Native Hawaiians on Kauai, Hawaii. General friendly trade occurred, but one Indigenous Hawaiian was killed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 January 1788:&lt;/strong&gt; The First Fleet&amp;rsquo;s arrival in Sydney, Australia, led to contact between the British Empire and the Cadigal and Bidjigal peoples. The initial contact was friendly but reserved, with one aborigine likely beaten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 November 1791:&lt;/strong&gt; William R. Broughton led a British expedition to Chatham Island, New Zealand, resulting in contact with the Moriori people. Initial shows of aggression by the Moriori were followed by peaceful relations, but a fight led to the death of one Moriori.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1930:&lt;/strong&gt; Mick Leahy led an Australian expedition to the New Guinea Highlands, resulting in contact with the Papuan people. The contact was friendly, with some Highland people believing the Australians were their ancestors and attempting to rub off their white skins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article documents alleged UFO sightings in Belgium, focusing primarily on the significant wave of sightings between 1989 and 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1989-1990&#34;&gt;1989-1990 &lt;a href=&#34;#1989-1990&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the Belgian UFO wave, a period of intense UFO activity. The main feature of this wave was the frequent reports of triangular UFOs observed across the country. These objects were even pursued by Belgian Air Force F-16 fighter jets, and some photographs were taken. One speculative explanation suggested these sightings might have been misidentified stealth aircraft, specifically the F-117 Nighthawk, using Belgian highways for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1990-03-30&#34;&gt;1990-03-30 &lt;a href=&#34;#1990-03-30&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details a specific mass sighting event that occurred on March 30, 1990, in Ans, Wallonia. Numerous witnesses reported seeing large, silent, low-flying black triangles. These objects were tracked by multiple NATO radar systems and intercepted by jet fighters. The Belgian military investigated the incident, and photographic evidence is said to exist. A close encounter was also reported during this event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-britney-spears-song&#34;&gt;Alien (Britney Spears song) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-britney-spears-song&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; is a song by Britney Spears from her 2013 album &lt;em&gt;Britney Jean&lt;/em&gt;. The song is a mid-tempo dance-pop track about Spears&amp;rsquo; feelings of loneliness. It received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its production and personal nature. Despite not being released as a single, it charted on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 and the French Singles Chart. Spears performed the song during her &amp;ldquo;Britney: Piece of Me&amp;rdquo; residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her time as a judge on &lt;em&gt;The X Factor&lt;/em&gt;, Spears began working on her eighth studio album in December 2012. William Orbit was announced as a producer for the project in May 2013. Spears described &amp;ldquo;Alien,&amp;rdquo; her collaboration with Orbit, as &amp;ldquo;really cool&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;really great.&amp;rdquo; There were initial rumors of a collaboration with Lady Gaga, but this did not happen. A demo version of the song leaked online before the album&amp;rsquo;s release, which Orbit stated had incorrect chorus notes that were fixed in the final version. Spears considered releasing &amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; as a single, as revealed in her documentary &lt;em&gt;I Am Britney Jean&lt;/em&gt;, but this never materialized. In July 2014, an unedited vocal track of Spears singing the song leaked, drawing criticism for her uncorrected vocals. Orbit defended Spears, stating that the leaked audio was a vocal warm-up and not intended for public release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;composition&#34;&gt;Composition &lt;a href=&#34;#composition&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; is a midtempo dance-pop song co-written by Spears, William Orbit, Dan Traynor, Ana Diaz, and Anthony Preston, and produced by Orbit and HyGrade. The song&amp;rsquo;s musical style has been compared to Madonna&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ray of Light&lt;/em&gt; album, which was also produced by Orbit. Lyrically, the song explores themes of loneliness. A vocal glitch at 2:14 in the song sparked discussion, with Orbit joking that it was due to an alien abduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; was generally well-received by music critics, who praised its production and personal themes. Critics highlighted Orbit&amp;rsquo;s production and Spears&amp;rsquo; vulnerability on the track. Some reviewers compared the song favorably to Madonna&amp;rsquo;s work with Orbit. However, one critic felt that Spears&amp;rsquo; vocal performance did not match the song&amp;rsquo;s solemn production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spears performed &amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; during her &amp;ldquo;Britney: Piece of Me&amp;rdquo; residency at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. One performance was notable because Spears was caught lip-syncing when the backing track continued playing after she missed her cue. The song was later removed from the setlist but was briefly re-added following Spears&amp;rsquo; breakup with her boyfriend David Lucado.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34;&gt;The Roswell Incident (1980 book) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry details the 1980 book &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and William Moore, which significantly contributed to popularizing the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Roswell incident, focusing on the events of 1947 and the renewed interest in the story in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;events-of-1947&#34;&gt;Events of 1947 &lt;a href=&#34;#events-of-1947&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection outlines the initial reports of the Roswell incident during the &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze&amp;rdquo; of 1947, Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting, the Roswell Army Air Field&amp;rsquo;s initial press release about recovering a crashed disc, and the subsequent retraction stating it was a weather balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roswell-revisited&#34;&gt;Roswell revisited &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-revisited&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains how the Roswell story gained traction again in 1978 when retired lieutenant colonel Jesse Marcel claimed in an interview with ufologist Stanton Friedman that the debris he recovered was extraterrestrial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authors&#34;&gt;Authors &lt;a href=&#34;#authors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides background information on the authors of the book, Charles Berlitz and William Moore. It mentions Berlitz&amp;rsquo;s previous success with &lt;em&gt;The Bermuda Triangle&lt;/em&gt; and their collaboration on &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents &lt;a href=&#34;#contents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the book&amp;rsquo;s central argument: that an extraterrestrial craft crashed in New Mexico while observing nuclear weapons activity, and the US government engaged in a cover-up. It highlights accounts of debris described as &amp;ldquo;nothing made on this earth&amp;rdquo; and mentions witnesses like Bill Brazel, Floyd Proctor, and Walt Whitman Jr. The section also notes the book&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the idea that the debris shown in photos with Marcel was substituted as part of the cover-up. It also mentions the claim that the military sought to discredit the growing interest in flying saucers. The section also notes that the authors claimed to have interviewed over 90 witnesses, but only a fraction of those accounts appear in the book. The section also notes that the book elevated Marcel&amp;rsquo;s narrative above that of Cavitt, whose description of the debris contradicted Marcel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-bodies&#34;&gt;Alien bodies &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-bodies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the book&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the story about Barney Barnett and archaeology students encountering wreckage and &amp;ldquo;alien bodies&amp;rdquo; on the Plains of San Agustin. It also mentions the conflation of the Roswell incident with the Aztec, New Mexico, UFO incident, a hoaxed flying saucer crash promoted by Frank Scully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the reception of the book, noting that critics deemed it &amp;ldquo;a collection of wild hearsay&amp;rdquo; and that it &amp;ldquo;did not make the commercial impact its authors hoped.&amp;rdquo; It also mentions accusations against Moore regarding the Majestic 12 documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions Moore&amp;rsquo;s admission at a 1989 MUFON conference that he had engaged in &amp;ldquo;disinformation&amp;rdquo; activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-views&#34;&gt;Modern views &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section references the 1993 inquiry by the General Accounting Office in response to US congressman Steven Schiff, which led to a 1994 Air Force report concluding that the recovered material was likely debris from Project Mogul, a military surveillance program using high-altitude balloons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finnish Air Force UFO sighting</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;finnish-air-force-ufo-sighting&#34;&gt;Finnish Air Force UFO Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#finnish-air-force-ufo-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finnish Air Force UFO sighting, also known as &amp;ldquo;The seven balloons of Pori,&amp;rdquo; refers to a UFO observation that occurred on April 12, 1969, in Pori, Finland, during military training exercises. This event is notable as the only UFO observation acknowledged by the Finnish Air Force. The Air Force suggested the objects may have been foreign reconnaissance aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sighting&#34;&gt;Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a Fouga Magister jet training mission at Pori Airport on April 12, 1969, a Finnish Defence Forces flight controller instructed pilot-in-training Tarmo Tukeva to investigate seven airborne objects. These objects were floating at an altitude of approximately 1500-3000 meters above the airport. Tukeva described the objects as ball or disc-shaped but could not accurately determine his distance from them. He reported that the objects accelerated away from him &amp;ldquo;at great speed.&amp;rdquo; Radar images, the nature of which remains undetermined, were also reported 200 kilometers away in Vaasa. Jouko Kuronen, another pilot-in-training, stated that he overheard the radio communications between the flight controller and Tukeva and also observed the objects. According to the Finnish Armed Forces magazine &lt;em&gt;Ruotuväki&lt;/em&gt;, the reports from April 12 were similar to other cases occurring over bodies of water during ongoing military exercises, suggesting the possibility of &amp;ldquo;transnational spy planes or aircraft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-religion&#34;&gt;UFO Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UFO religion is a religion where belief in extraterrestrial entities operating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) is a core element. Adherents typically believe these ETs are interested in humanity&amp;rsquo;s welfare and that humanity will eventually join an existing ET civilization. Some UFO religions incorporate ETs into a supernatural worldview, blurring the lines between aliens and angels. These religions draw inspiration from early science fiction, ufology, UFO sightings, and alien abduction stories. The Aetherius Society, founded by George King, is considered the first UFO religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adherents believe that the arrival or rediscovery of alien civilizations, technologies, and spirituality will enable humans to overcome ecological, spiritual, and social problems. Issues like hatred, war, bigotry, and poverty are believed to be resolvable through superior alien technology and spiritual abilities. These belief systems are often millenarian in their outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO religions developed in countries like the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan, where technology is advanced enough to conceive of ETs and where religion is not suppressed. The term &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; and the popular notion of the UFO originated in 1947. The study of UFO religions by sociologists, historians, theologians, scholars of religious studies, and new religious movements began in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-ufo-religions&#34;&gt;Notable UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO religions generally involve belief in communication with extraterrestrial beings through physical contact, telepathy, and astral projection. These groups often believe that humanity will be saved by aliens who will educate humans on a better way to live or take believers to a more positive location. Extraterrestrial beings are often seen pleading with humanity to improve itself and move away from greed and violence. UFO religions emphasize spiritual growth and the evolution of humanity. A UFO religion can form before or after an individual claims to have experienced an alien abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Gordon Melton identifies the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; Activity, founded by Guy Ballard, as the first UFO religion, although Christopher Hugh Partridge views it as a theosophical religion. Partridge notes that UFO religions believe the supreme being or &amp;ldquo;evolved entity&amp;rdquo; came from another plane or planet. The 1947 Roswell incident is a key point in time within UFO spirituality. James R. Lewis notes that Ufologists see it as the date of the &amp;ldquo;emergence of UFOs into the public consciousness.&amp;rdquo; Partridge places UFO religion within the context of theosophical esotericism and asserts that it began to be associated as &amp;ldquo;UFO religion&amp;rdquo; after the Roswell incident. He notes that most UFO religions still have many of the key points associated with Theosophy, such as belief in the same Spiritual Hierarchy, and he also draws parallels to New Age thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hunt describes the Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, as &amp;ldquo;probably the first and certainly the most enduring UFO cult.&amp;rdquo; Hunt places the Aetherius Society and Raëlism among the &amp;ldquo;most renowned&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;flying saucer cults.&amp;rdquo; Melodie Campbell and Stephen A. Kent place the Aetherius Society and Unarius as among the &amp;ldquo;oldest and most studied&amp;rdquo; of the flying saucer cults. They describe Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate and Order of the Solar Temple as the &amp;ldquo;most controversial groups combining UFO belief with variations of contactee assertions.&amp;rdquo; Gregory L. Reece classes Scientology as a &amp;ldquo;UFO group,&amp;rdquo; discussing elements of the Xenu cosmogony and Space opera in Scientology doctrine. He compares Scientology to the Aetherius Society and Ashtar Command. Victoria Nelson writes that &amp;ldquo;[t]he most prominent current UFO religion is probably the science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s Church of Scientology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien Planet (2005 TV series)</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-planet-2005-tv-series&#34;&gt;Alien Planet (2005 TV series) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-planet-2005-tv-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2005 docufiction TV special created for the Discovery Channel, based on Wayne Barlowe&amp;rsquo;s 1990 book &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;. It explores the imagined extraterrestrial life of the fictional planet Darwin IV in the style of a nature documentary. It features scientists and science fiction figures discussing Darwin IV as if it had actually been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Von Braun&lt;/em&gt; interstellar spacecraft travels to Darwin IV, 6.5 light-years away. It deploys the &lt;em&gt;Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/em&gt; to find landing sites for probes. The first probe, &lt;em&gt;Balboa&lt;/em&gt;, explodes during entry. Backup probes &lt;em&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/em&gt; (Leo) and &lt;em&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/em&gt; (Ike) land successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic probes, called Horus Probes, are equipped with inflatable balloons, solar receptors, computers, sensors, and smaller robots. They have limited AI and are programmed with different personalities. Ike is cautious, while Leo is a risk-taker. They are equipped with a holographic message for any sentient life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probes encounter various lifeforms, including Arrowtongues, Gyrosprinters, Trunk Suckers, Daggerwrists, and Unths. Ike studies plant life, while Leo goes after big game. A massive storm hits, and Ike launches weather balloons. Leo finds Bladderhorns and attempts to present the holographic message, but is interrupted. Ike encounters Grovebacks, Littoralopes, Skewers, Beach Quills, and Prongheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leo briefly re-establishes contact with &lt;em&gt;Von Braun&lt;/em&gt; until a mysterious creature interferes. Ike is ordered to search for Leo. Ike finds a sea that is Amoebic in nature and encounters giant Sea Striders. Ike finds Leo&amp;rsquo;s last known location, where a Skewer is killed by a spear. Ike finds Leo and the sapient Eosapiens. Ike presents the holographic message to the Eosapiens, but one of them destroys the camera disk, and the Eosapiens attack Ike. The wrecked camera disk records the Eosapiens carrying Ike away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary from Michio Kaku, Stephen Hawking, Jack Horner, James B. Garvin, and George Lucas is interspersed throughout the special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Planet&lt;/em&gt; is based on &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt; (1990) by Wayne Barlowe. Barlowe served as one of the executive producers. Scientists and other figures were assembled to comment on the life on Darwin IV. The documentary gives the appearance of the featured scientists having designed Darwin IV and its animals, most of what is shown of the actual planet and its life follows what is described in &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;, which is set in the mid-24th century, &lt;em&gt;Alien Planet&lt;/em&gt; is set in the near future, and the planet is explored using sophisticated probes. The technology featured is more advanced than present-day technology, but is based on current trends and informed speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwayne A. Day of &lt;em&gt;The Space Review&lt;/em&gt; gave the special a positive review. Some criticism was leveled at the strangeness of the creatures showcased. Day stated that the animals are bizarre and frequently border on the implausible. A review in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; stated that a few too many of the creatures seem like cartoonish monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dover-demon&#34;&gt;Dover Demon &lt;a href=&#34;#dover-demon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dover Demon is a creature reportedly sighted in Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the reported sightings of the Dover Demon in April 1977. William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Bartlett, John Baxter, and Abby Brabham, all teenagers at the time, independently reported seeing a strange creature. Bartlett described it as about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth, with a watermelon-shaped head. Baxter reported a similar sighting on Miller Hill Road, and Brabham claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue. The teenagers drew sketches of the creature, with Bartlett swearing on a stack of Bibles to the accuracy of his drawing. The locations of the sightings, when plotted on a map, formed a straight line over 2 miles. The sightings became public in May, and a local investigator noted similarities to the creatures in the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter. The Mutual UFO Network also investigated the sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-explanations&#34;&gt;Possible explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the Dover Demon sightings. One suggestion is that the creature was a foal or a moose calf. Skeptic Joe Nickell proposes that the creature was likely a snowy owl, citing its size and plumage, which could reflect yellow headlights. The &amp;ldquo;long spindly arms&amp;rdquo; could be the partially opened wings of the owl. Police suggested the sightings were a school vacation hoax. Ben Radford suggests the sightings may have been influenced by the release of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the Dover Demon&amp;rsquo;s appearances in popular culture. It was featured in an episode of the American horror television series &lt;em&gt;Lost Tapes&lt;/em&gt; on Animal Planet in 2009. The Dover Demon appears as a character in the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;, where it can see into the future, and in &lt;em&gt;The Perhapanauts&lt;/em&gt;. It also made appearances in &lt;em&gt;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&lt;/em&gt;. A Dover Demon appears in the webcomic &lt;em&gt;Gunnerkrigg Court&lt;/em&gt;. In the manga series &lt;em&gt;Dandadan&lt;/em&gt;, an alien known as Dover Demon takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Northern Light (spacecraft)</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_91cb3c28f781/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 00:37:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_91cb3c28f781/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;northern-light&#34;&gt;Northern Light &lt;a href=&#34;#northern-light&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Light was a proposed Canadian Mars lander and rover mission. It was a concept mission studied by a consortium of Canadian universities, companies, and organizations, with Thoth Technology Inc. as the primary contractor. The mission was ultimately cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mission-overview&#34;&gt;Mission Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission aimed to send a lander and rover to Mars. The spacecraft would have consisted of an apogee kick engine, a cruise vehicle, the Northern Light lander, and the Beaver Rover. A Hohmann transfer orbit would have been used for the journey to Mars. Atmospheric entry would have been achieved using a heat shield, parachute, and airbag system. The lander would have deployed the rover onto the Martian surface and communicated directly with Earth via the Algonquin Radio Observatory&amp;rsquo;s 46 m parabolic antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;beaver-rover&#34;&gt;Beaver Rover &lt;a href=&#34;#beaver-rover&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beaver Rover was designed to have a maximum range of 1000 meters from the landing site. It would have been battery-powered and equipped with tools and sensors to investigate surface rocks for evidence of photosynthetic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project officially began in 2001, led by Ben Quine of York University. York University has a history of participation in the Canadian Space Program and has designed space research instruments used by NASA, including the meteorological station on the Phoenix Mars lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involved partnerships with several Canadian universities, including York University, University of Alberta, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, University of Winnipeg, University of Western Ontario, University of Saskatchewan, University of New Brunswick, McGill University, and Simon Fraser University. Mission control after landing was planned to be headquartered at York University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated cost was $20 million, potentially less with international collaboration. The Canadian Space Agency was aware of the project but not involved. In 2014, a crowdfunding campaign was launched on Indiegogo and YouTube to raise $1.1 million CAD for flight hardware development, but it only raised $10,012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;scientific-goals&#34;&gt;Scientific Goals &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-goals&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission had four primary scientific goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for life on Mars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for water on Mars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate the Martian electromagnetic radiation environment and atmospheric properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare for international Mars sample return and human missions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;payload-of-the-beaver-rover&#34;&gt;Payload of the Beaver Rover &lt;a href=&#34;#payload-of-the-beaver-rover&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beaver Rover was designed for geological surface exploration and subsurface imaging. Weighing approximately 6 kg, it would have operated independently with a range of about 1 km. It would have carried a visible camera for navigation and surface exploration, a point spectrometer, and a microscope camera for geological surveys. A ground-penetrating radar would have explored the Martian subsurface for water, and an active vibrator and receiver would have conducted an acoustic study of the subsurface. A rock grinding tool was included for immediate subsurface exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;massur-seismic-sensor&#34;&gt;MASSur Seismic Sensor &lt;a href=&#34;#massur-seismic-sensor&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MASSur Seismic Sensor, developed by the University of Calgary, would have provided depth profiles of the Martian surface. A seismometer would have tested the rigidity and elasticity of the Martian topsoil and its rock properties. The seismic system would have used a vibrational source and accelerometers on both the lander and the rover. The redundancy of sensors on both platforms ensured that some primary science objectives could be met even without rover deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ground-penetrating-radar&#34;&gt;Ground Penetrating Radar &lt;a href=&#34;#ground-penetrating-radar&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) would have used a 200 MHz radar to provide fine-scale subsurface imaging to a depth of 20 m in loose aggregate and up to 100 m in permafrost or ice. The design shared systems with the seismic instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tc-corer&#34;&gt;TC Corer &lt;a href=&#34;#tc-corer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corer would have been capable of drilling up to 10 mm into surface rocks. It would have been used with the Aurora spectrometer and microscope to examine the near-surface composition and search for biosignatures. The core was a contribution from Hong Kong. The flight model instrument had an estimated mass of 350 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;payload-of-the-northern-light-lander&#34;&gt;Payload of the Northern Light Lander &lt;a href=&#34;#payload-of-the-northern-light-lander&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aurora-spectrometer&#34;&gt;Aurora Spectrometer &lt;a href=&#34;#aurora-spectrometer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed spectrometer would have had a wavelength coverage of 625 nm to 2500 nm and observed the whole sky. It would have measured variations in spectral irradiance to determine aerosol and atmospheric composition, including carbon dioxide concentration. It would also have measured the angular dependency of radiation influx in the atmosphere. The Aurora instrument had a mass of 450 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;argus-spectrometer&#34;&gt;Argus Spectrometer &lt;a href=&#34;#argus-spectrometer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar in design to the Argus 1000 spectrometer flown on CanX-2, the radiometer would have been the primary equipment of the Northern Light lander, making measurements of spectral rock reflectance. The spectrometer had a mass of 240 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera-systems&#34;&gt;Camera Systems &lt;a href=&#34;#camera-systems&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera systems on the lander would have had narrow and wide field survey capabilities. The narrow field survey would have provided a high-resolution, panoramic view of the landing site. Color filters would have performed spectral mapping and mineral identification of the surrounding soil. The camera would also have performed limited atmospheric and astronomical observations. Color images of Earth would have been obtained. The wide field survey would have provided an overall color view of the lander&amp;rsquo;s surroundings to help rover deployment and route planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;massur-seismic-sensors&#34;&gt;MASSur Seismic Sensors &lt;a href=&#34;#massur-seismic-sensors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar specifications as those on the Beaver Rover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environmental-sensors&#34;&gt;Environmental Sensors &lt;a href=&#34;#environmental-sensors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental sensors would have monitored conditions at the landing site. Instruments would have measured UV rays, oxidizing substances, air pressure, air temperature, dust impact, wind velocity, and ground vibration. These sensors would have a combined mass of 130 g. Flight models were previously developed for Britain&amp;rsquo;s Beagle 2 lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tracking&#34;&gt;Tracking &lt;a href=&#34;#tracking&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry system would have been tracked and targeted using a combination of Doppler radar and very long baseline interferometry. This data would have been processed by a high-resolution orbital model using high-precision ephemeris to predict spacecraft location and trajectory. Tracking would have commenced at the Algonquin Radio Observatory upon launch. Continuous tracking would have commenced as the package reached the Martian thermosphere to verify mechanism deployment during descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;landing-site&#34;&gt;Landing Site &lt;a href=&#34;#landing-site&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landing site would have been determined from one of three options by a crowd sourcing campaign. One option was a dry &amp;lsquo;sea&amp;rsquo;, within 5 km of a basin formation.&lt;/p&gt;
