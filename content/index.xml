      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction-entities&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction Entities &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction-entities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the beings alleged to be responsible for alien abductions, focusing on their reported characteristics, motivations, and the plausibility of these claims. It acknowledges the ongoing debate surrounding the phenomenon, with scientists and mental health professionals largely attributing such experiences to psychological and environmental factors rather than literal events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alleged-motivations&#34;&gt;Alleged Motivations &lt;a href=&#34;#alleged-motivations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the purported reasons behind alien abductions, as claimed by experiencers. Dr. John G. Miller is mentioned, noting that abductees often report entities claiming a &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; to perform invasive procedures. Author and UFOlogist Jenny Randles&amp;rsquo; study is highlighted, which analyzed motivations given by abductors in about 50 abduction claims. Randles found a common narrative of long-term surveillance and interaction, where entities target individuals for unique qualities, repeatedly abducting them to implant information that will be activated later, potentially to assist humanity during major Earth changes. Different entity types, such as &amp;ldquo;Nordics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Grays,&amp;rdquo; are said to have varying motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types&#34;&gt;Types &lt;a href=&#34;#types&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section categorizes the different types of entities reported in alien abduction claims. It presents two tables summarizing these types based on different studies. The first table, based on a survey of 203 pre-1985 abduction claims, lists types such as &amp;ldquo;Short Humanoids,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Average (Human) Height Humanoids,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Tall Humanoids,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Mummy-like,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Miscellaneous Humanoids,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Human-like,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Non-human.&amp;rdquo; The second table, based on Claudier Covo&amp;rsquo;s Brazilian Alien Typology from 138 alleged abductions, categorizes entities as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omega, and Sigma based on their height and form. The section also mentions &amp;ldquo;Mantid aliens,&amp;rdquo; described by abductees as often being in charge of Grays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reported-technology&#34;&gt;Reported Technology &lt;a href=&#34;#reported-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the technology allegedly used by alien abduction entities. It mentions reports of levitation, entities passing through walls, and other advanced capabilities. It also references ufologists&amp;rsquo; books that describe these technologies without providing detailed hypotheses about their feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;weapon&#34;&gt;Weapon &lt;a href=&#34;#weapon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on a specific weapon allegedly used by Grey aliens, as described in Nick Pope&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;The Uninvited&lt;/em&gt;. The weapon is described as a black, cylindrical device, similar in size to a pencil, with a bluish light on one end. It is supposedly used to subdue combative abductees by numbing their will, resembling a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; phaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;medical&#34;&gt;Medical &lt;a href=&#34;#medical&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection describes a medical device reported by Linda Moulton Howe, a pencil-sized cylindrical device with a light on one end, independently reported in at least two alleged abductions. The device is said to function like a surgical scalpel, opening the body bloodlessly and in &amp;ldquo;slow motion,&amp;rdquo; described by one claimant as &amp;ldquo;opening the body with sound.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plausibility-and-veracity&#34;&gt;Plausibility and Veracity &lt;a href=&#34;#plausibility-and-veracity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines the credibility of alien abduction claims, considering factors that might influence abductor descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hypnosis-as-an-influence-on-abductor-descriptions&#34;&gt;Hypnosis as an Influence on Abductor Descriptions &lt;a href=&#34;#hypnosis-as-an-influence-on-abductor-descriptions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the impact of hypnosis on the descriptions of abducting beings. Folklorist and abduction researcher Thomas E. Bullard notes that while skeptics might expect Hollywood influence to dominate descriptions, the abduction literature doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect this. Bullard also observes that hypnosis as a memory retrieval method seems to affect descriptions, with hypnotically assisted recall more likely to produce descriptions of &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; Grey humanoids, while cases without hypnosis include more variety. Bullard poses the question of whether hypnosis shapes memories or reveals the true appearance of the beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geography-and-culture-as-influences-on-abductor-descriptions&#34;&gt;Geography and Culture as Influences on Abductor Descriptions &lt;a href=&#34;#geography-and-culture-as-influences-on-abductor-descriptions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores how cultural and geographic factors influence abduction reports. Robert Sheaffer observes that the types of aliens reported vary by region, with large-headed gray aliens predominating in North America, tall, blond, Nordic aliens in Britain, and more bizarre creatures in South America. The section also notes that the &amp;ldquo;grey alien&amp;rdquo; paradigm is primarily associated with North America since the 1980s, while researchers like Kevin D. Randle have documented a vast variety of alleged creatures reported worldwide. Common elements in abduction descriptions vary by region and local culture, with only a few elements being consistent worldwide, such as otherworldly sensations, mind control, repressed memories, and sexual experiences, which are also common in stories of encounters with faeries, demons, and other magical creatures. In Brazil, links exist between the abduction phenomenon and spiritist traditions, with reports of spiritual space surgeons sharing common imagery with alien abductions but perceived as pleasant and spiritual rather than terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;science-fiction-as-an-influence&#34;&gt;Science Fiction as an Influence &lt;a href=&#34;#science-fiction-as-an-influence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection considers the potential influence of science fiction on abduction claims. Sheaffer notes similarities between aliens depicted in early science fiction films, such as &lt;em&gt;Invaders From Mars&lt;/em&gt;, and those reported in abduction accounts. Commonalities exist in the appearances, behavior, technology, and societies of fictional and allegedly real abductors. The &amp;ldquo;abduction narrative&amp;rdquo; was established in fictional form by 1930 in a Buck Rogers comic strip. However, Bullard does not see evidence for influence on abduction claimants from science fiction sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien abduction</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. Those who claim to have been abducted are referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; The prevailing scientific and mental health perspective attributes these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology. Skeptics draw parallels between alien descriptions and science fiction films like &lt;em&gt;Invaders From Mars&lt;/em&gt; (1953).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, particularly focusing on reproductive systems. Some abductees report warnings about environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or involvement in interspecies breeding. The narratives often vary based on the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background. UFOs, alien abduction, and mind control are sometimes integrated into radical political apocalyptic and millenarian narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports are global, but most common in English-speaking countries, especially the United States. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 was the first widely publicized case. UFO abduction claims have declined since the mid-1970s, possibly due to the increased availability of camera phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally dismiss claims of literal alien abduction. John E. Mack, a psychiatrist who gave credence to such claims, noted that most abductees are sane individuals, with psychopathology present in only some cases. Detailed abduction reports have led to the development of a subculture with support groups and a mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, etc.). Some claimants conduct independent research and attribute the lack of wider awareness to extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to &amp;ldquo;alien abduction&amp;rdquo; in the 1960s, some older stories have been speculated as possible cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1896, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1953, an article in &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; questioned whether humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1955, Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported the mysterious disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who had claimed contact with aliens, speculating they were victims of abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two landmark cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 generated widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident was a prototypical case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases established a template for later abductees and researchers. Purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s and became convinced of its actuality. He was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually, Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989. Budd Hopkins became interested in abduction reports in the 1970s and used hypnosis to extract more details, becoming a figurehead of the abductee subculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980s brought mainstream attention to the subject through works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard&amp;rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of ufology. Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected, estimating that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that aliens were attempting to create human–alien hybrids, the most advanced stage of which in the &amp;ldquo;human hybridization program&amp;rdquo; are known as hubrids, though the motives for this effort were unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher&amp;rsquo;s emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Skeptic Michael Shermer noted that &amp;ldquo;the camera-phone age is increasing the burden of evidence on experiencers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; called him &amp;ldquo;a well-meaning man uncritically elaborating on tales of alien abduction, and potentially both cementing and constructing false memories&amp;rdquo;. Boyce observed that Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression of claimants helped spread the Grey aliens meme into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack became interested in claims of alien abduction in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people and eventually writing two books on the subject. Due to Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief and subsequent promotion of the claims of those he interviewed, his professional reputation suffered, prompting Harvard to review his position in 1994. He retained tenure, but &amp;ldquo;was not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population allege to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &amp;ldquo;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&amp;rdquo;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking&amp;rdquo;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &amp;ldquo;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism&amp;rdquo;. UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives, where alleged orthodoxy is claimed to be maintained in error for nefarious purposes and to keep society in ignorance. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; and its motion picture not only included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters but also featured demonization of FEMA, a common target of conspiracy theorists and millenarian scenarios. One conspiracy theory alleges that FEMA plans to incarcerate &amp;ldquo;patriots&amp;rdquo; suddenly in concentration camps during a disaster. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering it important to warn the world of such imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS&amp;rsquo;s definition of &lt;em&gt;abductee&lt;/em&gt;, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; through means like hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind&amp;rdquo; (a popular but unofficial designation building on J. Allen Hynek&amp;rsquo;s classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;. The abduct&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-autopsy-1995-television-film&#34;&gt;Alien Autopsy (1995 television film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy-1995-television-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the 1995 pseudo-documentary &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which featured footage purporting to show an alien autopsy conducted after the Roswell incident. The program, hosted by Jonathan Frakes, aired on Fox and other networks worldwide, sparking intense debate before being thoroughly debunked as a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the production of the &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; footage. Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield admitted to creating the footage in a 2006 documentary. The simulated autopsy was filmed in a London living room using fabricated alien bodies constructed by artist John Humphreys. The alien bodies were made of plaster casts filled with offal, sheep brains, and raspberry jam. Alien artifacts were also created by Humphreys. A homeless man was paid to pose as the original cameraman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines how &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; was received and referenced in popular culture. The program was widely derided, including being satirized in &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Fox later aired a special debunking the footage. A fictionalized version of the creation and release of the footage was retold in the comedy film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section lists the various sources used to support the information presented in the article. These include books, news articles, and documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cattle-mutilation&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilation &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle (and other animals) under unusual and often bloodless circumstances. The phenomenon is often linked to paranormal or supernatural explanations, including cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. The article notes that similar mutilations have been observed in other livestock and wild animals, with specific body parts often removed. Two independent federal investigations in the United States have been conducted on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-history&#34;&gt;Early History &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest documented outbreak of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in England in 1606. Later, Charles Fort collected accounts of cattle mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

The Pueblo Chieftain published a story about the incident, which gained national attention and sparked speculation about extraterrestrial involvement. Agnes King and her son Harry found the horse&amp;rsquo;s body, noting the precise cuts and lack of blood. Wadsworth Ayer investigated for the Condon Committee and concluded there was no evidence of abnormal causes. Sheriff Ben Phillips suggested a lightning strike as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

It mentions reports of unidentified helicopters involved in cattle rustling in Iowa and Missouri in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1973-kansas-wave&#34;&gt;1973 Kansas Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1973-kansas-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about suspicious phone calls from someone posing as a USDA official. Several butchered cows were found on farms in the area, with right ears removed. Local press speculated about a &amp;ldquo;Mad Dog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;phantom&amp;rdquo; butcher. By December, law enforcement reported investigating 40 mutilations across Kansas and Nebraska. State Senator Ross Doyen also reported a mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&amp;rsquo;s office attributed most deaths to natural causes, a conclusion disputed by Modlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1974-nebraska-wave&#34;&gt;1974 Nebraska Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1974-nebraska-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of mutilations resumed in April 1974 in Nebraska. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations and helicopter sightings. Mutilations were reported in Iowa and Nebraska counties. In Custer County, there were reports of helicopter sightings and armed patrols. An unidentified helicopter was spotted shining a spotlight above a field where a mutilated cow was later found near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported armed civilian patrols. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation leaned toward predators as the cause. State Sen. John Decamp called for a coordinated investigation. By late August, 25 mutilations were reported across five Nebraska counties. Authorities cautioned the public against shooting at aircraft. A meeting of law enforcement officials from 24 counties was held to discuss the mutilations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1975-colorado&#34;&gt;1975 Colorado &lt;a href=&#34;#1975-colorado&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&amp;rsquo;s top story in 1975. Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI, claiming 130 mutilations in Colorado and reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing $1 million in damages. Donald E. Flickinger of the Michigan ATF investigated possible links to a &amp;ldquo;Hell-oriented biker gang.&amp;rdquo; The Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34;&gt;1976 Dulce, New Mexico &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1979-public-meeting&#34;&gt;1979 Public Meeting &lt;a href=&#34;#1979-public-meeting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. Paul Bennewitz reported seeing unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. Gabe Valdez reported finding tranquilizers in the remains of a mutilated bull. In June 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with radar chaff nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-incidents&#34;&gt;Later Incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#later-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since 1967, especially in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unusual cattle deaths are characterized by the absence of sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, rectum, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts are described as &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;surgical.&amp;rdquo; Some animals are reported to have been drained of blood with no sign of blood in the area. Nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. Strange marks or imprints near the site have been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;laboratory-reports&#34;&gt;Laboratory Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#laboratory-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory reports on some mutilated animals have shown unusual levels of vitamins or minerals and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. In a case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI involving a bull belonging to Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, the animal displayed classic mutilation signs. The animal&amp;rsquo;s heart, bone, and muscle samples were sent to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, while liver samples were sent to private laboratories. The liver was found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain high levels of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Blood samples did not clot, and the hide was unusually brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;helicopter-sightings&#34;&gt;Helicopter Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#helicopter-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1974, two unregistered helicopters reportedly opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. in Honey Creek, Iowa. In August 1974, residents reported seeing unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter. In April 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft resembling a U.S. military helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-investigations&#34;&gt;Official Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#official-investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34;&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms &lt;a href=&#34;#bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1975, the ATF launched an investigation headed by Agent Donald Flickinger to investigate possible connections between cults and cattle mutilation. Flickinger recorded unusual incidents but found insufficient evidence of cult involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34;&gt;Colorado Bureau of Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. 19 animals underwent necropsies at Colorado State University, but no conclusive results emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-mexico-state-police&#34;&gt;New Mexico State Police &lt;a href=&#34;#new-mexico-state-police&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1976, the New Mexico State Police began an investigation headed by Officer Gabe Valdez. Valdez solicited assistance from retired Sandia National Laboratories scientist Howard Burgess. The investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rommel-investigation&#34;&gt;Rommel Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#rommel-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in May 1979, an investigation was funded by a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and headed by retired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel. Rommel&amp;rsquo;s report concluded that the mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but some cases contained anomalies that could not be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conventional-explanations&#34;&gt;Conventional Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#conventional-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several potential explanations for cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;natural-causes&#34;&gt;Natural Causes &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-causes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing or mutilated body parts are explained as the actions of scavengers, parasites, and dehydration. Absence of blood is explained as blood pooling or consumption by insects. Surgical incisions are explained as tears in the skin due to bloating or dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;animal-cruelty-pranks-and-hoaxes&#34;&gt;Animal Cruelty, Pranks, and Hoaxes &lt;a href=&#34;#animal-cruelty-pranks-and-hoaxes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilations are hypothesized to be the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies are the work of humans who derive pleasure from mutilating animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;covert-monitoring-of-threats-to-public-health&#34;&gt;Covert Monitoring of Threats to Public Health &lt;a href=&#34;#covert-monitoring-of-threats-to-public-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilations might be the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases. Colm Kelleher argues that the mutilations are a clandestine U.S. government effort to track the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (&amp;ldquo;mad cow disease&amp;rdquo;). Greg Valdez concludes that mutilations were a government testing program looking at the after-effects of radiation from 1967&amp;rsquo;s Project Gasbuggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;secret-weapons-testing&#34;&gt;Secret Weapons Testing &lt;a href=&#34;#secret-weapons-testing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government was testing cattle parts to develop biological weapons. In March 1968, 6,000 sheep were killed as part of chemical weapons testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-explanations&#34;&gt;Other Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#other-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fringe explanations for the mutilation have blamed satanic cults, aliens, or even mythical monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;satanic-cults&#34;&gt;Satanic Cults &lt;a href=&#34;#satanic-cults&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity. However, the FBI and the ATF were unable to find appropriate evidence to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aliens&#34;&gt;Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press had linked reports of unidentified aircraft to UFOs and flying saucers. In 1974, farmers in Nebraska claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. In 1980, journalist Linda Moulton Howe claimed the mutilations were linked to UFOs and aliens. The 2013 documentary &lt;em&gt;Mirage Men&lt;/em&gt; suggests there was conspiracy by the U.S. military to fabricate UFO folklore. Paul Bennewitz was introduced to highway patrol officer Gabe Valdez at a public meeting about the ongoing cattle mutilations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mythic-monsters&#34;&gt;Mythic Monsters &lt;a href=&#34;#mythic-monsters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folklore&lt;/p&gt;

It also touches upon claims of government cooperation with extraterrestrials and the allowance of events like cattle mutilation and alien abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the historical context of UFO conspiracy theories, tracing their origins to pulp science fiction and &amp;ldquo;lost continent&amp;rdquo; myths. It mentions Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting and the subsequent surge in UFO reports. Key figures like Donald Keyhoe, who popularized the idea of a government cover-up, and the introduction of the &amp;ldquo;Men in Black&amp;rdquo; concept are highlighted. The section also covers the evolution of these theories, linking them to events like the Kennedy assassination and dramatizations in popular culture, such as the film &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;. It notes the shift from theories about benevolent &amp;ldquo;space brothers&amp;rdquo; to darker narratives involving malevolent aliens and government cabals. The section concludes by mentioning the renewed interest in UFO conspiracy theories following Leslie Kean&amp;rsquo;s reporting on a 21st-century Pentagon UFO program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mainstream-views&#34;&gt;Mainstream Views &lt;a href=&#34;#mainstream-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents the mainstream scientific perspective on UFOs, emphasizing that while unusual sightings have been reported throughout history, there is no confirmed evidence to support claims of extraterrestrial origins. It mentions government investigations like Project Blue Book and Project Condign, as well as skeptical organizations like the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, which offer prosaic explanations for UFO sightings, such as natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. The section also touches upon the psychosocial explanations for UFO beliefs, viewing them as modern folklore and mythology. Benjamin Radford&amp;rsquo;s argument about the unlikelihood of a decades-long, international government cover-up is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are purported extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 popularized the image of Grey aliens. These beings have become an archetypal image of extraterrestrial life and a popular trope in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greys are generally described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin and reduced or absent external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. They have disproportionately large heads, no hair, and small openings for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their most striking feature is their large, opaque, black eyes. They are often described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system originated with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the aliens showed her a map of their home system and nearby stars. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and identified the aliens&amp;rsquo; home as Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of beings similar to Grey aliens predate claims of encounters. H.G. Wells described future humans with large heads and lacking mouths, noses, or hair in his 1893 article &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; and his 1895 novel &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. In 1917, Aleister Crowley described a meeting with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, resembling a modern Grey. In 1933, Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren (Gabriel Linde) described aliens with grey clothes, bald heads, and large eyes in his science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archetype became famous in 1965 with newspaper reports of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. The Hills claimed that in 1961, grey-skinned humanoid aliens abducted them and took them aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which aired shortly before Barney&amp;rsquo;s first hypnotic session and featured an alien with large eyes. Carl Sagan echoed this suspicion, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter, Greys became integral to ufology and extraterrestrial folklore, especially in the United States, where they account for 73% of reported alien encounters. During the early 1980s, Greys were linked to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, a non-fiction book describing his alleged encounters with Greys, which became a bestseller and was adapted into a film. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu described &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; on French television, popularizing the term &lt;em&gt;les Petits-Gris&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys have since become the subject of many conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of a government disinformation campaign or products of mind-control experiments. During the 1990s, popular culture increasingly linked Greys to military-industrial complex and New World Order conspiracy theories. In 1995, Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage of an autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from Roswell, though he later admitted it was a &amp;ldquo;reconstruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greys are often involved in alien abduction claims, accounting for a significant percentage of reports in Australia, the United States, continental Europe, and the United Kingdom. These reports often describe traumatic experiences, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes are a focal point in these claims, with abductees describing Greys staring into their eyes to induce hallucinogenic states or provoke emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurologist Steven Novella proposes that Grey aliens are a product of the human imagination, with their features representing traits associated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frederick V. Malmstrom suggests that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development, reconstructing the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologist Jack Cohen argues that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interdimensional, cryptoterrestrial, and time-traveler hypotheses attempt to provide alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of these alleged beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens have become a common depiction of extraterrestrials in fiction, supplanting the &amp;ldquo;little green men.&amp;rdquo; They have appeared in films and television shows like &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;. During the 1990s, plotlines linking Greys to conspiracy theories became common, as seen in &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The film &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; presence in pop culture to the US government deliberately inserting their image into mainstream media. The 2013 film &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; features child abduction by Greys. Greys also appear in the Syfy series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; and the 2023 game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nordic-aliens&#34;&gt;Nordic Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#nordic-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ufology, &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites&amp;rdquo; are terms used to describe alleged humanoid extraterrestrial races from the Pleiades star cluster. These beings are said to resemble Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans, with features like tall stature (6-7 ft), blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some reports describe their skin tone as pale blue/grey or pastel purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural historian David J. Skal suggests that early stories of Nordic aliens may have been inspired by the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;. Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; noting that believers often associate Nordic aliens with spiritual growth and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ufology, Nordic aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1950s, many people, especially in Europe, claimed encounters with these beings. However, such claims became less common in later decades, as the grey alien became more prevalent in extraterrestrial encounter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An eyewitness at a family BBQ were enjoying the day when someone pointed out a white orb in the sky above. Then others came and they noticed it stayed over them as if it were watching them and recording the humans reactions to what they were seeing. You see, aliens love knowledge, like humans like money, knowledge is everything to them. The smaller orb drones are sent out from a mother drone and months later gathered after the orbs have recorded information about anything and everything they saw.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-hive&#34;&gt;Alien Hive &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-hive&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Hive&lt;/em&gt; is a puzzle video game developed and published by Malaysia-based studio Appxplore in March 2013. It is available on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone platforms. The game combines match-three and sliding puzzle mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gameplay&#34;&gt;Gameplay &lt;a href=&#34;#gameplay&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gameplay involves swiping tiles to match eggs and aliens, with the goal of hatching, breeding, and evolving them into the Supreme Alien. Players aim to build the ultimate alien hive by matching resource tiles while avoiding Naughty Bots. Power-ups can be crafted to eliminate these troublemakers, and players are encouraged to minimize their moves. As players progress, they encounter more aliens and uncover their mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Fruit, collected by merging seeds into saplings, is key to evolving Supreme Aliens. These fruits allow merging of similar-level items using only two of a kind instead of three. Evolved Supreme Aliens can be activated using gold to provide special bonuses in future games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-app-purchase&#34;&gt;In App Purchase &lt;a href=&#34;#in-app-purchase&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Hive&lt;/em&gt; incorporates microtransactions, where real money can be exchanged for in-game gold to purchase consumable items. This aspect of the game has faced criticism, with one review suggesting that microtransactions are almost essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Hive&lt;/em&gt; received an average score of 70 out of 100 based on reviews aggregated by Metacritic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2015, the game had achieved over 3 million downloads across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no such life has been conclusively detected, it could range from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The study of extraterrestrial life falls under the domain of astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides a framework for understanding the topic of life in the universe. It outlines the conditions necessary for life to arise, starting from the Big Bang and the formation of elements like carbon and oxygen through stellar fusion. It touches on the concepts of planetary systems, habitable zones, and the vast distances involved in studying extraterrestrial life. The section also mentions the role of abiogenesis and panspermia in the origin and spread of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section delves into the debate about whether life in the cosmos is common or rare. It presents the argument for ubiquitous extraterrestrial life, based on the size and age of the universe, the abundance of life&amp;rsquo;s building blocks, and the universality of physical laws. Key figures like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view. The opposing Rare Earth hypothesis, which posits that a unique combination of factors makes Earth exceptionally suited for life, is also discussed. The Drake equation, developed by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic tool for estimating the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, while acknowledging its controversial and speculative nature. The Fermi paradox, the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for them, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the potential biochemical foundations of extraterrestrial life. It acknowledges that life could range from microorganisms to intelligent beings. It discusses the requirements for life, including non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a solvent (primarily water), and essential elements like carbon. Alternative solvents like ammonia and hydrocarbons are also considered. The section examines the possibility of different biochemistries, including the potential for silicon-based life, while noting the advantages of carbon. It also touches on the role of natural selection, replication, and cell membranes in the evolution of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34;&gt;Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life &lt;a href=&#34;#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the discovery of life thriving in extreme environments on Earth, such as hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs. These environments, once considered uninhabitable, provide parallels to the harsh conditions found on other planets and support the possibility of extraterrestrial life existing in similar extreme conditions. The section emphasizes the importance of chemical reactions, such as chemosynthesis, in sustaining life in these environments, particularly in the absence of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34;&gt;Planetary Habitability in the Solar System &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section assesses the potential for life on various bodies within our solar system. Besides Earth, Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most promising candidates. Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that may have once been similar to Earth. Mars is considered a potential site for past or present microbial life. The subsurface oceans of Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Enceladus are explored as possible habitats. Titan, with its hydrocarbon lakes and subsurface ocean, is also mentioned as a unique environment that could potentially support life with different biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-search&#34;&gt;Scientific Search &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-search&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the scientific methods used to search for extraterrestrial life. Astrobiology, the science dedicated to this search, combines astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and other disciplines. The search encompasses both direct and indirect methods, including the analysis of telescope data, specimen data, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-basic-life&#34;&gt;Search for Basic Life &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-basic-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for biosignatures, indicators of life, within the solar system and beyond. It mentions past claims of evidence for microbial life on Mars, including structures resembling nanobacteria in the ALH84001 meteorite and gas emissions detected by the Viking landers. The Mars Science Laboratory and the Curiosity rover are highlighted as ongoing efforts to assess the habitability of Mars. The section also mentions the creation of a catalog of microorganisms and their reactions to sunlight to aid in the search for similar organisms on exoplanets. The discovery of organic molecules, including nucleobases and sugars, in meteorites and cosmic dust is presented as evidence that the building blocks of life may be widespread in the universe. The detection of hydrogen cyanide in the plumes of Enceladus is also mentioned as a possible chemical essential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) through the detection of technosignatures, indicators of technology. It mentions the SETI Institute&amp;rsquo;s search for radio waves and laser pulses. It also explores the possibility of detecting atmospheric effects, such as air pollution, and planetary-sized structures, such as Dyson spheres. The Green Bank Telescope is mentioned as one of the radio telescopes used by the Breakthrough Listen project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extrasolar-planets&#34;&gt;Extrasolar Planets &lt;a href=&#34;#extrasolar-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for exoplanets, particularly terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars. It notes the discovery of thousands of exoplanets and the role of the Kepler space telescope in this effort. The section mentions the estimate that at least one in five Sun-like stars has an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. Proxima Centauri b is identified as the nearest known exoplanet. The section also discusses the analysis of exoplanet atmospheres for signs of oxygen and other biosignatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-and-cultural-impact&#34;&gt;History and Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#history-and-cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical and cultural context of the search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosmic-pluralism&#34;&gt;Cosmic Pluralism &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-pluralism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the philosophical belief in numerous worlds beyond Earth, known as cosmic pluralism, back to ancient Greece. It contrasts the atomist view of Epicurus, who believed that other worlds with their own animals and plants should exist, with the Aristotelian view that Earth was the only planet in the universe. The section also mentions the support for cosmic pluralism in ancient Jainism and by medieval Muslim writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-modern-period&#34;&gt;Early Modern Period &lt;a href=&#34;#early-modern-period&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the impact of the Copernican Revolution and the heliocentric model on the concept of extraterrestrial life. It mentions Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei as key figures in this shift. Giordano Bruno is highlighted as an early proponent of the idea of an infinite universe with countless planetary systems. The section also notes the resistance to these new ideas from the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;19th-century&#34;&gt;19th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#19th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the increased speculation about life on Mars in the late 19th century, fueled by telescopic observations of apparent Martian canals. Percival Lowell is mentioned as a prominent proponent of the idea that these canals were the work of a civilization. The section also notes the spectroscopic analysis of Mars&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, which revealed the absence of water and oxygen. The disproving of spontaneous generation by Louis Pasteur is mentioned, as well as the rise of the science fiction genre and its influence on public perception of extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recent-history&#34;&gt;Recent History &lt;a href=&#34;#recent-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the development of astrobiology as a scientific discipline. It mentions NASA, ESA, and INAF as organizations involved in astrobiology research. The section also notes the emergence of pseudosciences, such as ufology and the ancient astronauts hypothesis, in response to public interest in extraterrestrial life. It also mentions the Rare Earth hypothesis, which argues that complex life is uncommon in the universe. The section concludes by noting the ongoing scientific efforts to search for extraterrestrial life and the technological advances that may make it possible to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;government-responses&#34;&gt;Government Responses &lt;a href=&#34;#government-responses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the government policies and actions related to extraterrestrial life. It mentions the Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement as defining rules of planetary protection. COSPAR is also mentioned as providing guidelines for planetary protection. The section notes that the UN lacks response mechanisms for the case of an extraterrestrial contact. NASA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is highlighted for its mission to prevent backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life. The space programs of China, Russia, France, and Israel are also mentioned as having objectives related to the search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-fiction&#34;&gt;In Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the portrayal of extraterrestrial life in fiction. It notes that early depictions of aliens were often similar to humans, but that the theory of evolution led to the creation of more diverse and bizarre aliens. The section mentions the influence of real-life events, such as the Barney and Betty Hill incident, on the depiction of aliens in fiction, particularly the grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;area-51&#34;&gt;Area 51 &lt;a href=&#34;#area-51&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&amp;rsquo;s a remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&amp;rsquo;s believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF and CIA acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the subject of conspiracy theories and UFO folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&amp;rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. It&amp;rsquo;s located in southern Nevada, 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography &lt;a href=&#34;#geography&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;area-51-1&#34;&gt;Area 51 &lt;a href=&#34;#area-51-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original rectangular base is part of the &amp;ldquo;Groom box,&amp;rdquo; a rectangular area of restricted airspace. It&amp;rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with roads leading to Mercury and Yucca Flat. Groom Lake Road runs northeast through the Jumbled Hills, past a security checkpoint, and descends to the Tikaboo Valley, converging with State Route 375, the &amp;ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&amp;rdquo; south of Rachel. Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, the location of numerous nuclear tests. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is southwest of Groom Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;groom-lake&#34;&gt;Groom Lake &lt;a href=&#34;#groom-lake&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groom Lake is a salt flat in Nevada used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (XTA/KXTA) on the north of the Area 51 USAF military installation. The lake is approximately 3+3⁄4 mi (6 km) from north to south and 3 mi (5 km) from east to west at its widest point. It is located within the Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, 25 mi (40 km) south of Rachel, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the name &amp;ldquo;Area 51&amp;rdquo; is unclear. The correct names for the facility are Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake. The facility has also been referred to as &amp;ldquo;Dreamland&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; The special use airspace around the field is referred to as Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N). Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864, and mining continued until the early 1950s. The airfield began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-2-program&#34;&gt;U-2 program &lt;a href=&#34;#u-2-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE: the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Project director Richard M. Bissell Jr. chose Groom Lake as the testing site. Kelly Johnson, Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s U-2 designer, found the lake bed ideal for testing aircraft. The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated &amp;ldquo;Area 51,&amp;rdquo; and add it to the Nevada Test Site. Johnson named the area &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; The Ranch initially consisted of shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. By July 1955, the base consisted of a paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and accommodations for test personnel. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oxcart-program&#34;&gt;OXCART program &lt;a href=&#34;#oxcart-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project OXCART was established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12. This included testing at Groom Lake, which had inadequate facilities. A-12 test facility construction began in September 1960, including a new runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) began construction of &amp;ldquo;Project 51&amp;rdquo; on 1 October 1960. The contractor upgraded base facilities and built a new 10,000 ft (3,000 m) runway. They marked an Archimedean spiral on the dry lake. By August 1961, construction of the essential facilities was complete. A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed by early 1962 for the special JP-7 fuel required by the A-12. Security was enhanced, and the FAA expanded the restricted airspace. The CIA facility received various USAF aircraft for training and support. The first A-12 test aircraft arrived at Groom Lake on 28 February 1962 and made its first flight 26 April 1962. Groom was also the site of the first Lockheed D-21 drone test flight on 22 December 1964. By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA-operated &amp;ldquo;1129th Special Activities Squadron&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;d-21-tagboard&#34;&gt;D-21 Tagboard &lt;a href=&#34;#d-21-tagboard&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of Gary Powers&amp;rsquo; U-2 over the Soviet Union, there were discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. The Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The project designated &amp;ldquo;Q-12&amp;rdquo; was renamed the &amp;ldquo;D-21&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Tagboard&amp;rdquo; was the project&amp;rsquo;s code name. The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the &amp;ldquo;M-21&amp;rdquo;. Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21 caused it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft, resulting in one crew member drowning. Kelly Johnson cancelled the entire program. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and Johnson proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber. Several more tests, including two over China, were made from Beale AFB, California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foreign-technology-evaluation&#34;&gt;Foreign technology evaluation &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-technology-evaluation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured Soviet fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Munir Redfa&amp;rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 from Iraq for Israel&amp;rsquo;s Mossad in Operation Diamond led to the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters. In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in late 1967 for study. In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy&amp;rsquo;s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet-made aircraft in simulated air combat training. On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel with a pair of MiG-17s. Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed Top Gun school at NAS Miramar. In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed, which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects, and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport. Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. In 2017, a USAF aircraft crashed at the site, killing the pilot, Lt. Colonel Eric &amp;ldquo;Doc&amp;rdquo; Schultz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-bluef-117-program&#34;&gt;Have Blue/F-117 program &lt;a href=&#34;#have-bluef-117-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter first flew at Groom in December 1977. In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full-scale development (FSD) prototype 79–780, designated YF-117A. On 18 June 198&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;crop-circle&#34;&gt;Crop Circle &lt;a href=&#34;#crop-circle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crop circle, also known as a crop formation or corn circle, is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two hoaxers, claimed responsibility for creating over 200 crop circles throughout England. Reported circles often appear near roads, populated areas, and cultural heritage monuments like Stonehenge and Avebury, typically appearing overnight. Archaeological remains can cause cropmarks, but these are different from crop circles as they don&amp;rsquo;t appear overnight and are always in the same locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Before the 20th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1678 news pamphlet, &lt;em&gt;The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire&lt;/em&gt;, describes a crop with cut stalks. In 1686, naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings of mushrooms, proposing air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991, meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles. An 1880 letter to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by John Rand Capron describes circles of flattened crops possibly caused by &amp;ldquo;cyclonic wind action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;20th-century&#34;&gt;20th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester. David Wood reported making crop circles near Gloucestershire in 1940 using ropes. In 1963, Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire and circular areas in nearby wheat fields, suggesting air currents from the impact as a cause. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler suggested lightning strikes. During the 1960s, there were reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada. In 1966, a farmer in Tully witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise from a swamp, leaving a circular area of flattened grass. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported starting to create crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo; case. The 1974 film &lt;em&gt;Phase IV&lt;/em&gt; depicted a geometric crop circle created by super-intelligent ants. Reports of crop circles increased in the late 1970s, becoming widely known in the late 1980s after media coverage in Hampshire and Wiltshire. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles had been reported internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st Century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes and incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics. Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not randomly spread but appeared near roads, populated areas, and cultural heritage monuments, suggesting intentional human action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bower-and-chorley&#34;&gt;Bower and Chorley &lt;a href=&#34;#bower-and-chorley&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley claimed to have started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978, using simple tools. They demonstrated their method to journalists, fooling &amp;ldquo;cereologist&amp;rdquo; Pat Delgado. They claimed responsibility for all circles made prior to 1987 and for over 200 crop circles in 1978–1991. Richard Taylor noted that their creations inspired a second wave of crop artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;art-and-business&#34;&gt;Art and Business &lt;a href=&#34;#art-and-business&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly complex geometric designs have been created by anonymous artists, sometimes to attract tourists. The UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles as art and for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set featured an image of a crop circle. A crop-circle-making competition was held in Berkshire in 1992, with the winning entry produced by Westland Helicopters engineers. In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned MIT graduate students to create crop circles. In 2009, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, as makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies. A video sequence used in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening in London showed crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A crop circle depicting the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Rebel Alliance emblem was created in California in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;legal-implications&#34;&gt;Legal Implications &lt;a href=&#34;#legal-implications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1992, Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle in Hungary. They were sued for damages, but the judge ruled they were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-origin&#34;&gt;Human Origin &lt;a href=&#34;#human-origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus is that crop circles are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. A common method involves using a rope and board to flatten the plants. Skeptics point out that all characteristics of crop circles are compatible with human creation. Bower and Chorley confessed to making the first crop circles in southern England. Increasingly complex circles started appearing worldwide, with physicists suggesting that the most complex formations might be made with GPS and lasers.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1880, John Rand Capron blamed circles in crops on a recent storm. In 1980, Terence Meaden proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds. Stephen Hawking said that &amp;ldquo;Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Some speculate that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lightning and controlled by some entity, such as Gaia, God, supernatural beings, the collective minds of humanity, or extraterrestrial beings. The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &amp;ldquo;man-made.&amp;rdquo; No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.&lt;/p&gt;

Joe Nickell objected to these claims, raising objections to the methods and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

Crop circles appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, the origin of tales of &amp;ldquo;fairie rings.&amp;rdquo; A 17th-century English woodcut, the &lt;em&gt;Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt;, depicts the devil mowing a circular design in a field of oats. In the 1948 German story &lt;em&gt;Die zwölf Schwäne&lt;/em&gt;, a farmer finds a circular ring of flattened grain in his field every morning, caused by princesses disguised as swans dancing in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ancient-astronauts&#34;&gt;Ancient Astronauts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-astronauts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced the development of human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected modern cultures, technologies, religions, and human biology. A common idea is that deities from religions are extraterrestrial in origin, and advanced technologies were seen as divine by early humans. Academics and archaeologists dismiss these claims as pseudoarchaeological or unscientific, lacking credible peer-reviewed studies. Some argue that these theories have racist undertones, diminishing the accomplishments of indigenous cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI. Believers often claim that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence who landed on Earth in the past. They also suggest that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these ancient extraterrestrial visitors, who acted as a &amp;ldquo;mother culture.&amp;rdquo; Proponents argue that aliens built or aided in building structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island. Evidence is said to come from documentary gaps in historical and archaeological records, as well as artifacts believed to be anachronistic and beyond the technical capabilities of ancient people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is considered pseudoarcheology and is featured in fringe media like the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. Such shows mix fact with fiction to promote theories of an alternate past, often aligning with white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents portray themselves as an oppressed minority of academics, claiming a conspiracy by &amp;lsquo;big archaeology&amp;rsquo; to disenfranchise them. They focus on monumental archaeological structures, implying that non-white indigenous people could not have built them without extraterrestrial intervention. However, some indigenous voices argue that the idea of extraterrestrials supports their own origin stories. A common feature is the portrayal of aliens as light-skinned or Aryan, as claimed by Erich von Däniken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34;&gt;History of Ancient Aliens Beliefs and Their Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paleocontact narratives first appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It gained popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and the success of Erich von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s works. Critics emerged in the 1970s, discrediting Von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s claims. By the early 1980s, support for the idea dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shklovskii-and-sagan&#34;&gt;Shklovskii and Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#shklovskii-and-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan and Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky co-authored &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; in 1966. Sagan later expressed disapproval of writers like von Däniken who built on their ideas without caution, presenting them as valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact. Sagan pointed out that many legends, artifacts, and purported out-of-place artifacts cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses could be easily explained with more conventional hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;erich-von-däniken&#34;&gt;Erich von Däniken &lt;a href=&#34;#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erich von Däniken became a leading proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis in the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining a large audience through his book &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; According to von Däniken, certain artifacts required more sophisticated technology than was available to the ancient cultures that constructed them. He maintained that these artifacts were constructed either directly by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from them. These include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken wrote that ancient art and iconography throughout the world illustrate air and space vehicles, non-human but intelligent creatures, ancient astronauts, and artifacts of anachronistically advanced technology. He also stated that geographically separated historical cultures share artistic themes, implying a common origin. One example is his interpretation of the sarcophagus lid from the tomb of Pacal the Great in Palenque, which he saw as representing a seated astronaut. He interpreted the origins of many religions as reactions to encounters with an alien race, viewing the aliens&amp;rsquo; technology as supernatural and the aliens themselves as gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, that many of his claims were unfounded, and that none of his core claims have been validated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s series &lt;em&gt;The Earth Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;, beginning with &lt;em&gt;The 12th Planet&lt;/em&gt;, revolves around Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts. He hypothesized that the gods of old Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet &amp;ldquo;Nibiru,&amp;rdquo; which the Sumerians believed to be a remote &amp;ldquo;12th planet&amp;rdquo; associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin argued that Sumerian texts tell the story that 50 Anunnaki from Nibiru came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago to mine raw materials, especially gold. They eventually created &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/em&gt;: the &amp;ldquo;Adapa&amp;rdquo; (model man) or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the abrupt end of the last ice age some 12,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been criticized by professionals. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s translations of Sumerian and Mesopotamian words are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;robert-temple&#34;&gt;Robert Temple &lt;a href=&#34;#robert-temple&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert K. G. Temple&amp;rsquo;s 1976 book, &lt;em&gt;The Sirius Mystery,&lt;/em&gt; argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Sumer. His work draws heavily on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies within Temple&amp;rsquo;s account, and suggested that the Dogon may have received some of their astronomical information recently, probably from European sources, and may have misrepresented Dogon ethnography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various new religious movements including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, Raëlism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these faiths see both ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens from other planetary systems. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities which suggest that members of these groups consciously or subliminally associate enchantment with the memes of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;claims-of-proponents&#34;&gt;Claims of Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#claims-of-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists generally agree that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; cited as evidence can be explained without invoking ancient astronauts. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancient-religious-texts&#34;&gt;Ancient Religious Texts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-religious-texts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents cite ancient mythologies to support their viewpoints, suggesting that ancient creation myths of gods descending from the heavens to Earth to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors. They draw an analogy to occurrences in modern time when isolated cultures are exposed to advanced technology, such as when &amp;ldquo;cargo cults&amp;rdquo; were discovered in the South Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Sumerian myth of &lt;em&gt;Enûma Eliš&lt;/em&gt;, inscribed on cuneiform tablets and part of the Library of Ashurbanipal, says humankind was created to serve gods called the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Annunaki&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Hypothesis proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to Earth to mine gold for their own uses and then created the human race as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ramayana&#34;&gt;Ramayana &lt;a href=&#34;#ramayana&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel in flying vehicles called Vimana. There are many mentions of these flying objects in the &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt;. Erich von Däniken discusses the &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;vimanas&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; suggesting that they were &amp;ldquo;space vehicles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bible&#34;&gt;The Bible &lt;a href=&#34;#the-bible&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;book-of-genesis-and-book-of-enoch&#34;&gt;Book of Genesis and Book of Enoch &lt;a href=&#34;#book-of-genesis-and-book-of-enoch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Book of Genesis, Chapter 6 verses 1–2 and 4, states that the &amp;ldquo;sons of God&amp;rdquo; saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. The Nephilim were on the earth in those days when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. Ancient Astronaut proponents argue that Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit in order &amp;ldquo;to be godlike&amp;rdquo;, and this was the first step in human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the apocryphal Book of Enoch expands and interprets Genesis 6:1: that the &amp;ldquo;sons of God&amp;rdquo; were a group of 200 &amp;ldquo;angels&amp;rdquo; called &amp;ldquo;Watchers&amp;rdquo;, who descended to Earth to breed with humans. Their offspring are the Nephilim, &amp;ldquo;giants&amp;rdquo; who &amp;ldquo;consumed all the acquisitions of men&amp;rdquo;. The Watchers also instructed humans in metallurgy and metalworking, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. God then ordered the Watchers to be imprisoned in the ground, and created the Great Flood to rid Earth of the Nephilim and of the humans given knowledge by the Watch&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction (also called abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction) refers to the phenomenon of people reporting what they believe to be the real experience of being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation.[1] People claiming to have been abducted are usually called &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo;[2] or &amp;ldquo;experiencers&amp;rdquo;. Most scientists and mental health professionals explain these experiences by factors such as suggestibility (e.g. false memory syndrome), sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology.[3] Skeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between some of the aliens described by abductees and those depicted in science fiction films, in particular Invaders From Mars (1953).[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical claims involve forced medical examinations that emphasize the subject&amp;rsquo;s reproductive systems.[5] Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuses and the dangers of nuclear weapons,[6] or to have engaged in interspecies breeding.[7] The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.[4] Unidentified flying objects (UFOs), alien abduction, and mind control plots can also be part of radical political apocalyptic and millenarian narratives.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Fictional Depictions of Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article provides an overview of how extraterrestrial life is portrayed in fiction, distinguishing it from claims of actual alien encounters. It emphasizes the prevalence of extraterrestrials as a theme in science fiction and other works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the evolution of extraterrestrial depictions in fiction, starting from ancient times to the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;antiquity&#34;&gt;Antiquity &lt;a href=&#34;#antiquity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses early examples of extraterrestrial life in literature, highlighting Lucian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True History&lt;/em&gt; as a key example. It explains how early concepts of aliens were tied to the development of astronomy and the understanding of celestial objects as physical entities. Early depictions often portrayed extraterrestrials as human-like. Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Micromégas&lt;/em&gt; and works by Johannes Kepler, Francis Godwin, and Cyrano de Bergerac are mentioned as examples where aliens differed from humans only in culture or habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; is discussed, noting how it revolutionized the portrayal of aliens by inspiring authors to imagine non-humanoid extraterrestrial races. Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s works are cited as some of the first to feature genuinely alien lifeforms. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The First Men in the Moon&lt;/em&gt; are also mentioned as significant contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; is further analyzed for its use of Darwinian evolution, exploration of the implications of evolution, and critique of British imperialism. It also introduced the tropes of alien invasion and extraterrestrials as monsters. &lt;em&gt;The First Men in the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is noted as an early attempt to describe an alien civilization in detail, drawing parallels to an ant colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of science fiction as a genre is mentioned, with Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s works as examples of stories exploring extraterrestrials and space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early 20th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the role of pulp magazines in popularizing science fiction. It describes the common tropes of the era, including quasi-human aliens, monstrous invaders, and human conquest of alien worlds. The prevalence of aliens from planets and moons within the Solar System is noted. Stanley G. Weinbaum&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A Martian Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is highlighted for its unique Martian ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-times&#34;&gt;Modern Times &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-times&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the evolution of alien depictions in more recent times. &lt;em&gt;The Eternaut&lt;/em&gt; by Héctor Germán Oesterheld is mentioned as a pioneering work of alien invasion set in Buenos Aires, serving as a critique of imperialism and military dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barney and Betty Hill incident is discussed as a pivotal event that shaped the modern image of grey aliens. Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s films, such as &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&lt;/em&gt;, are mentioned as influential works that popularized the grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of television and film on alien portrayals is noted, with &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; being mentioned as a franchise that popularized human-like aliens. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; are also mentioned as significant franchises that contributed to the public&amp;rsquo;s interest in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI) is discussed as a factor that allowed for the creation of more bizarre and diverse alien lifeforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types&#34;&gt;Types &lt;a href=&#34;#types&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section categorizes the different ways extraterrestrials are portrayed in fiction. It covers variations in intelligence, biological aspects, and attitudes towards humanity. It also mentions the concept of extraterrestrials originating from unexplored areas of Earth, such as the sea, sky, underground, or other dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

It clarifies that the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial being&amp;rdquo; in this context differs from the biological definition of &amp;ldquo;alien species&amp;rdquo; in ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;list&#34;&gt;List &lt;a href=&#34;#list&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents a table listing alleged extraterrestrial beings, providing their names and brief descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flatwoods Monster:&lt;/strong&gt; A tall humanoid with a spade-shaped head, associated with the Flatwoods Monster incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greys:&lt;/strong&gt; Grey-skinned humanoids, typically around 1 meter tall, hairless, with large heads and black almond-shaped eyes. They are linked to the Roswell incident and have been a prominent feature in alleged alien contact since the 1960s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopkinsville Goblin:&lt;/strong&gt; Small, greenish-silver humanoids, connected to the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Green Men:&lt;/strong&gt; Diminutive green humanoids, a classic cultural stereotype, though actual abduction reports rarely match this description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nordic Aliens:&lt;/strong&gt; Humanoids with stereotypical &amp;ldquo;Nordic&amp;rdquo; features (tall, blonde hair, blue eyes), sometimes referred to as Space Brothers. This category includes Plejarens (previously known as Pleiadeans), Venusians, Tall Whites, and Agarthans from Agartha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptozoological Animals and Cryptobotanical Plants:&lt;/strong&gt; Creatures from folklore, religion, and mythology (e.g., golems, dwarves, giants from Atlantis), as well as reports of ghosts, poltergeists, and time travelers. Examples include the Mothman, Jersey Devil, Loch Ness Monster, Nommo, Mokele-mbembe, Yokai, Quinametzin, Rephaite, and Loveland Frogman. It suggests that some believe these creatures are of extraterrestrial or mixed origin, as proposed in the extraterrestrial, interdimensional, or cryptoterrestrial hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reptilians and Reptiloids:&lt;/strong&gt; Tall, scaly humanoids, sometimes linked to ancient astronauts. This category includes Draconians and Orion reptilian-humanoids. David Icke is mentioned as a proponent of the reptilian conspiracy theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rods or Skyfish:&lt;/strong&gt; Elongated visual artifacts appearing in photos and videos, sometimes claimed to be extraterrestrial beings, but generally believed to be caused by motion blur from flying insects.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be immediately identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and escalated during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained. Government investigations and studies by organizations and individuals have occurred over the years, but there is no confirmation of claims that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence or other unconventional hypotheses. Scientists and skeptic organizations often attribute UFOs to natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. The ongoing interest in UFOs is seen by social scientists as a modern example of folklore and mythology. The U.S. government has entities dedicated to UFO data collection and analysis: NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the Department of Defence All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were often called &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; based on the Kenneth Arnold incident. The term &amp;ldquo;unidentified flying object&amp;rdquo; (UFO) has been in use since 1947. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; for the USAF. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) first appeared in the late 1960s and has seen increasing usage in the 21st century. While technically a &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; refers to any unidentified flying object, in modern popular culture the term UFO has generally become synonymous with alien spacecraft. The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to separate this explanation of UFOs from totally earthbound explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that after careful investigation, the majority of UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. The 1952–1955 study for the USAF used categories such as &amp;ldquo;Balloon; Astronomical; Aircraft; Light phenomenon; Birds, Clouds, dust, etc.; Insufficient information; Psychological manifestations; Unknown; and Other&amp;rdquo;. Identified sources of UFO reports include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. A 1979 study by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry found that fewer than one percent of cases he investigated were hoaxes and most sightings were actually honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi advised his students to apply critical thinking to UFO claims, stating that the more you investigate, the more likely you are to find that there is LESS to these stories than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet, first recorded by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC, was often treated as a supernatural portent or omen. Some examples of pre-contemporary reports about unusual aerial phenomena include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens, a Roman writer, made references to things moving through the sky in his &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a Song Chinese government official, wrote about an unidentified flying object in his &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt; (1088).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woodcut by Hans Glaser in 1561 depicts the &amp;ldquo;celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg,&amp;rdquo; which has been connected to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A similar report comes from 1566 over Basel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On January 25, 1878, the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, had reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying &amp;ldquo;at wonderful speed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific and European theatres during World War II, round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters&amp;rdquo; were reported by Allied and Axis pilots. In 1946, more than 2,000 reports were collected, primarily by the Swedish military, of unidentified aerial objects over the Scandinavian nations, along with isolated reports from France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. The objects were referred to as &amp;ldquo;Russian hail&amp;rdquo; (and later as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular UFO craze in the US began with a media frenzy surrounding the reports on June 24, 1947, of a civilian pilot named Kenneth Arnold who described seeing &amp;ldquo;a group of bat-like aircraft flying in formation at high speeds&amp;rdquo; near Mount Rainier that he said were &amp;ldquo;moving like a saucer would if skipped across water&amp;rdquo; which led to headlines about &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo;. Within weeks, reports of flying saucer sightings became a daily occurrence with one particularly famous example being the Roswell incident in 1947. In 1950, three influential books were published—Donald Keyhoe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Flying Saucers Are Real&lt;/em&gt;, Frank Scully&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Behind the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;, and Gerald Heard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Riddle of the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media accounts and speculation ran rampant in the U.S., especially in connection to the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. so that, by 1953, the intelligence officials worried that &amp;ldquo;genuine incursions&amp;rdquo; by enemy aircraft &amp;ldquo;over U.S. territory could be lost in a maelstrom of kooky hallucination&amp;rdquo; of UFO reports. The cultural phenomenon showed up within some intellectual works such as the 1959 publication of &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky&lt;/em&gt; by Carl Jung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1947, the U.S. Air Force began to record and investigated UFO reports with Project Sign looking into &amp;ldquo;more than 250 cases&amp;rdquo; from 1947 to 1949. It was replaced by Project Grudge up through 1951. In the third U.S. Air Force program, from March 1952 to its termination in December 1969, &amp;ldquo;the U.S. Air Force cataloged 12,618 sightings of UFOs as part of what is now known as Project Blue Book&amp;rdquo;. Official U.S. Air Force interest in UFO reports went on hiatus in 1969 after a study by the University of Colorado led by Edward U. Condon and known as the Condon Report concluded &amp;ldquo;that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge&amp;rdquo; and that further time investigating UFO reports &amp;ldquo;cannot be justified&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs were part of American popular culture&amp;rsquo;s obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. In 1961, the first alien abduction account was sensationalized when Barney and Betty Hill underwent hypnosis after seeing a UFO and reported recovered memories of their experience that became ever more elaborate as the years went by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, a new round of media attention started when &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; broke the story of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program that was funded from 2007 to 2012 with $22 million spent on the program. Following this story, along with a series of sensationalized Pentagon UFO videos leaked by members of the program who became convinced that UFOs were genuine mysteries worth investigating, there was an increase in mainstream attention to UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the creation of his Galileo Project which intended to use high-tech astronomical equipment to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts in space and possibly within Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. Two government sponsored programs, NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were charged in part by Congressional fiat to investigate UFO claims more fully, adopting the new moniker &amp;ldquo;unexplained aerial phenomenon&amp;rdquo; (UAP) to avoid associations with past sensationalism. On 17 May 2022, members of the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation held congressional hearings with top military officials to discuss military reports of UAPs. Another Congressional hearing took place on July 26, 2023, featuring the whistleblower claims of former U.S. Air Force (USAF) officer and intelligence official David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Harris Poll in 2009 found that 32% of Americans &amp;ldquo;believe in UFOs&amp;rdquo;. A &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; study in June 2012 found that 36% of Americans believe UFOs exist and that 10% thought that they had spotted one. In June 2021 a Pew research poll found that 51% in the United States thought that UFOs reported by people in the military were likely to be evidence of intelligent life from beyond the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notable-cases-and-incidents&#34;&gt;Notable cases and incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-cases-and-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;britain&#34;&gt;Britain &lt;a href=&#34;#britain&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rendlesham Forest incident was a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights near Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk, England in late December 1980 which became linked with claims of UFO landings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Valensole UFO incident in 1965.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;allianceunion-universe&#34;&gt;Alliance–Union Universe &lt;a href=&#34;#allianceunion-universe&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alliance–Union universe is a fictional setting created by C. J. Cherryh for her science fiction novels. It spans the third and fourth millennia and focuses on humanity&amp;rsquo;s expansion into space. The universe is dominated by three major powers: Earth Company, the Alliance, and the Union. The Earth Company&amp;rsquo;s control is challenged by the Alliance and the Union, leading to conflicts and wars. The universe also includes various alien species and explores themes of cultural identity, political maneuvering, and technological advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides an overview of the Alliance–Union universe. It highlights the three main economic powers: Earth Company, the Alliance, and the Union. The Earth Company represents the original power based on Earth, while the Alliance is a confederation of trade merchants, and the Union is a breakaway government from the planet Cyteen. The section mentions the Company Wars, where the Earth Company&amp;rsquo;s attempts to control space expansion are thwarted. It also introduces the concept of &lt;em&gt;azi&lt;/em&gt;, cloned humans used by the Union. The section references Patricia Monk&amp;rsquo;s idea of the series forming a &amp;ldquo;megatext&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;collage novel&amp;rdquo; due to the interconnectedness of Cherryh&amp;rsquo;s works within this universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the historical timeline of the Alliance–Union universe. It begins with humanity&amp;rsquo;s initial expansion into space, financed by the Sol Corporation (later Earth Company). The development of space stations and the emergence of distinct cultural identities among stationers and merchanters are discussed. The discovery of Pell&amp;rsquo;s World and its native species, the Hisa, disrupts the existing power balance. The development of faster-than-light (FTL) travel leads to Earth&amp;rsquo;s attempts to reassert control, resulting in unrest and the formation of the Union. The Company War ensues, with the Union utilizing cloned soldiers (&lt;em&gt;azi&lt;/em&gt;). The conflict culminates at Pell Station, leading to the formation of the Alliance as a neutral power. Conrad Mazian&amp;rsquo;s rebellion and Signy Mallory&amp;rsquo;s defection are mentioned, along with the eventual establishment of a peace treaty and the rise of tensions between the Alliance and the Union. The section also touches on the political factions within the Union and the role of Ariane Emory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genre&#34;&gt;Genre &lt;a href=&#34;#genre&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section classifies the various works within the Alliance–Union universe by genre. Many of the stories are described as space opera or planetary romances. Works like &lt;em&gt;Cyteen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Downbelow Station&lt;/em&gt; are considered hard science fiction. The &amp;ldquo;Company Wars&amp;rdquo; novels and the &lt;em&gt;Faded Sun&lt;/em&gt; trilogy are examples of military science fiction. The &lt;em&gt;Merovingen Nights&lt;/em&gt; series is classified as science fantasy, while &lt;em&gt;Voyager in Night&lt;/em&gt; incorporates elements of horror fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;books-and-reading-order&#34;&gt;Books and Reading Order &lt;a href=&#34;#books-and-reading-order&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides guidance on the order in which to read the books set in the Alliance–Union universe.

Cherryh states that most books can be read in any order, with two exceptions: &lt;em&gt;Heavy Time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hellburner&lt;/em&gt; should be read in that order, and &lt;em&gt;Cyteen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; should be read in sequence. The novels in the &lt;em&gt;Faded Sun&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, the &lt;em&gt;Chanur&lt;/em&gt; novels, and the &lt;em&gt;Morgaine&lt;/em&gt; series are also designed to be read in order. The &lt;em&gt;Merovingen Nights&lt;/em&gt; series begins with &lt;em&gt;Angel with the Sword&lt;/em&gt; and continues with the short story anthologies.&lt;/p&gt;

It notes the &amp;ldquo;unbalanced&amp;rdquo; tag, indicating a need for more diverse viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ashtar is a name associated with an extraterrestrial being or group of beings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claims of contact are made through channeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Van Tassel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First claimed contact in 1952.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the background and development of the Ashtar concept, from its roots in Theosophy to its popularization through UFO contactees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ascended Masters from esoteric teachings are described as reappearing in space suits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of Ascended Masters is clear in the Ashtar teachings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;ashtar&amp;rdquo; appears in Helena Blavatsky&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Secret Doctrine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helena Blavatsky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Van Tassel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giant Rock, California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mojave Desert, California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landers, California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel moves to Giant Rock in 1947 and establishes a UFO Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Ministry of Universal Wisdom&amp;rdquo; is founded in 1953.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purported-contact-with-van-tassel&#34;&gt;Purported contact with Van Tassel &lt;a href=&#34;#purported-contact-with-van-tassel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on George Van Tassel&amp;rsquo;s claims of telepathic communication with Ashtar, including the apocalyptic messages he received and his interpretation of the Bible in terms of extraterrestrial intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel claimed to receive messages from Ashtar in 1952.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel interpreted the Bible in terms of extraterrestrial intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel claimed to receive instructions from Nikola Tesla to build the &amp;ldquo;Integratron&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early messages from Ashtar contained apocalyptic material regarding the hydrogen bomb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ashtar entered the Solar System as Commander in Chief of the Ashtar Galactic Command to warn humanity of the dangers of detonating the H-bomb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel claimed that Ashtar provided specific messages to pass on to the U.S. federal government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel claimed to have established a new form of telepathic communication with extraterrestrial intelligences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Van Tassel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikola Tesla&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel&amp;rsquo;s first purported contact with Ashtar in 1952.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The claimed intervention of Ashtar to prevent Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction through nuclear power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;giant-rock-space-conventions&#34;&gt;Giant Rock Space Conventions &lt;a href=&#34;#giant-rock-space-conventions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section describes the weekly channeling sessions and annual conventions held at Giant Rock, which helped to coalesce the contactee subculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Tassel held weekly channeling sessions at Giant Rock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These gatherings coalesced the scattered contactee subculture into a recognizable movement in January 1952.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The annual Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention began in 1953.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the well-known UFO contactees attended these conventions as speakers and channelers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the early messages Van Tassel claimed to have received from Ashtar were first presented to the public at these events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Van Tassel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J. Gordon Melton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giant Rock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention in 1953.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ashtar-command&#34;&gt;Ashtar Command &lt;a href=&#34;#ashtar-command&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the appropriation of the &amp;ldquo;Ashtar Command&amp;rdquo; concept by other contactees and channelers, leading to conflicting messages and a lack of central authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of an &amp;ldquo;Ashtar Command&amp;rdquo; was appropriated for use by a number of prominent early contactees and channelers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert Short began his own group called &amp;ldquo;Ashtar Command&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the mid-1950s, the concept of Ashtar and a galactic law enforcement agency preparing an imminent rescue of humanity had become well-established.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The public failure of predictions had a negative impact on the expansion of the Ashtar Command movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dozens of Ashtar channelers were presenting conflicting messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Van Tassel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert Short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elouise Moeller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adelaide J. Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giant Rock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development-into-spiritual-religion-1990s-onward&#34;&gt;Development into spiritual religion (1990s onward) &lt;a href=&#34;#development-into-spiritual-religion-1990s-onward&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section describes the evolution of the Ashtar message from a technological communication to a more spiritual role, with Ashtar becoming an Ascended Master figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ashtar message evolved into a spiritual message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ashtar began to play more of an Ascended Master role in the narratives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ashtar Command evolved into a movement that had a central authority for several decades up to the mid-1990s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The teachings claiming to be channeled from Ashtar varied immensely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much of the Ashtar channeling is akin to cargo cults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the Ashtar millenarian concepts involve a transformation of human beings, via these technologies, who will then return to the planet Earth to enjoy a golden millennium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the failure of prophecies, teachings were modified to include a less material and more spiritual emphasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuella&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andreas Grunschloss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1970s-broadcasts&#34;&gt;1970s broadcasts &lt;a href=&#34;#1970s-broadcasts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions the 1977 Southern Television broadcast interruption, where a voice claiming to be &amp;ldquo;Vrillon&amp;rdquo; of the Ashtar Galactic Command took over a television transmitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1971, a British radio talk show devoted to UFOs received a strange call-in claiming to originate from outer space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1977, a voice calling itself &amp;ldquo;Vrillon&amp;rdquo; of the Ashtar Galactic Command temporarily took over a television transmitter in southern England.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southern England&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1977 Southern Television broadcast interruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1986-prediction-of-1994-apocalypse&#34;&gt;1986 prediction of 1994 apocalypse &lt;a href=&#34;#1986-prediction-of-1994-apocalypse&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details Yvonne Cole&amp;rsquo;s predictions of Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction and the arrival of alien cultures in 1994, which ultimately failed to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yvonne Cole predicted the destruction of all Earth civilizations and the arrival on the planet of various alien cultures in 1994.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cole claimed that governments were working with extraterrestrials to prepare for contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The landing would be broadcast through the global media and include a message from the Ashtar Command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These prophecies furthered the continued fracturing and disappointment within the movement when they failed to occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yvonne Cole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The failed 1994 apocalypse prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-1994-pioneer-voyage-meditations&#34;&gt;The 1994 Pioneer Voyage meditations &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1994-pioneer-voyage-meditations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section describes the &amp;ldquo;lift-off experience&amp;rdquo; claimed by some Ashtar Command members in 1994, where they were placed aboard &amp;ldquo;ships of Light&amp;rdquo; circling the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small group of Ashtar Command members claimed that an extraordinary event had taken place: &amp;ldquo;the lift-off experience&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Galactic Fifth Fleet&amp;rdquo; had used &amp;ldquo;physical vibrational transfer&amp;rdquo; which involved the human consciousness (or, sometimes, the &amp;ldquo;etheric body&amp;rdquo;) being raised from the physical dimension and transferred to the &amp;ldquo;Light ships&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A second event was predicted for December 1994 in which over 250 people participated and which was declared by the leadership to have &amp;ldquo;opened a portal to the AC (Ashtar Command) ships for ever&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The purpose of the lift-off is for the ascension of the human race as a whole, to which individual ascension is a precursor and an aid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The collective ascension is being aided by large electronic grids deployed around the planet by the guardian ships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1994 Pioneer Voyage meditations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;developments-after-the-mid-1990s&#34;&gt;Developments after the mid-1990s &lt;a href=&#34;#developments-after-the-mid-1990s&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the use of the Internet by channeling groups to unify the movement and establish a single &amp;ldquo;authoritative&amp;rdquo; source for Ashtar messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several channeling groups began to utilize the Internet in order to promulgate their beliefs and to attempt to unify the movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cohesive response addressed the problem of conflicting, negative and failed prophecies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual channelers espousing messages which differed and continued to focus on themes such as the destruction of Earth, conspiracies, extraterrestrial mass evacuations and general fear-mongering were declared invalid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new, more unified movement declared that in future no new channels would be accepted unless they operated on the &amp;ldquo;level of the soul&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Channeled messages from Ashtar would be accepted as valid by the new orthodoxy if they complied with criteria consisting of a set of twelve guidelines which outlined what the movement stood for and how Ashtar would interact with society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new framework claimed that the millions of spaceships believed to be constantly in the vicinity of Earth would&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as physical spacecraft occupied by intelligent extraterrestrial organisms or probes designed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature back to the mid-1960s. Key figures mentioned include French ufologist Jacques Vallée, who used the term in his 1966 book, and French engineer Aimé Michel, who used it in a 1967 publication. James E. McDonald and James Harder also used the term in 1968, including during testimony before a Congressional committee. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book. Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; after defining it in the Condon Report (1969).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical roots of the ETH, tracing it back to earlier concepts such as Percival Lowell&amp;rsquo;s ideas about Martian canals and civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups like NICAP and APRO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34;&gt;Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides historical examples of speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a story from 1864 about the discovery of a mummified alien-like creature. It also discusses H. G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;The War of the Worlds&amp;rdquo; (1898), which popularized the idea of Martian invasion, and the &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; of the late 19th century, which some speculated were from Mars. Comic strips, radio shows, and movie serials like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon also contributed to the idea of alien visitation. Orson Welles&amp;rsquo; 1938 radio broadcast of &amp;ldquo;The War of the Worlds&amp;rdquo; caused public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34;&gt;The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the surge of UFO sightings in 1947, beginning with Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting of unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier. Arnold considered the possibility of extraterrestrial origins, and fan mail suggested the same. Senator Glen Taylor expressed a wish for the flying saucers to be spaceships from another planet to unify Earth. R. DeWitt Miller suggested they could be vehicles from Mars or other dimensions. The work of Charles Fort was also brought up. However, most people were unwilling to immediately conclude that the objects were extraterrestrial, and various other theories proliferated. A Gallup poll in August 1947 showed that most people either had no opinion or believed there was a mundane explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-public-opinion&#34;&gt;Evolution of Public Opinion &lt;a href=&#34;#evolution-of-public-opinion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines how public opinion regarding the ETH evolved. It mentions movies from the early 1950s depicting flying saucers and aliens. A 1951 poll reported that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen a man-made aircraft, while only a small percentage believed they had seen an alien craft. By 1957, 25% of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A 2002 Roper poll reported that 56% of respondents thought UFOs were real, with 48% believing that UFOs had visited Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion&#34;&gt;Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses NASA&amp;rsquo;s involvement with UAPs. In June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP and presented a paper in August 2021 supporting ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-or-government-studies&#34;&gt;Private or Government Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#private-or-government-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents examples of private or government studies that have concluded in favor of the ETH or had members who disagreed with official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Estimate of the Situation (1948), which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation, but was ordered destroyed. A West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. The CIA started their own internal scientific review. Extraterrestrial &amp;ldquo;believers&amp;rdquo; within Project Blue Book included Major Dewey Fournet and director Edward J. Ruppelt. The first CIA Director, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, urged Congressional action to reduce secrecy about UFOs. In 1967, Greek physicist Paul Santorini claimed that a 1947 Greek government investigation concluded that the European Ghost rockets of 1946 were extraterrestrial. David Saunders disagreed with the negative conclusion of the 1968 Condon Report. The 1999 French COMETA report concluded that the extraterrestrial visitor hypothesis was the most likely explanation for UFO phenomena. Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of the official French UFO investigation SEPRA, wrote that 14% of the cases studied were extraterrestrial in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34;&gt;Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It states that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien presence on Earth. No rigorous analysis has ever concluded that UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34;&gt;U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery &lt;a href=&#34;#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the U.S. military&amp;rsquo;s involvement in investigating and debunking UFOs. Army Air Forces Intelligence began a secret study of saucer reports in July 1947. The U.S. Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Project Sign was formed at the end of 1947. In 1948, Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Scientific Investigation took particular interest in UFOs after the 1952 UFO wave. The CIA organized the Robertson Panel in 1953, which recommended a policy of public debunkery to reduce UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;involvement-of-scientists&#34;&gt;Involvement of Scientists &lt;a href=&#34;#involvement-of-scientists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the scientific community&amp;rsquo;s lack of support for the ETH. Reports of UFOs are generally attributed to misinterpretations of common objects or phenomena, or hoaxes. Stephen Hawking expressed skepticism about the ETH. Carl Sagan noted the emotional nature of the idea of extraterrestrial visitation and the potential for self-deception. Peter A. Sturrock argued that the focus on the ETH has narrowed the debate. Sturrock conducted polls of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and American Astronomical Society members, which showed limited support for the ETH. J. Allen Hynek outlined seven key reasons why he could not accept the ETH, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34;&gt;Fewer Sightings Despite Camera Phone Technology &lt;a href=&#34;#fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section notes that the proliferation of smartphone camera technology has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, which has called into question the claimed phenomenology of UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa-1&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section states that NASA&amp;rsquo;s official standpoint is that the ETH lacks empirical evidence. David Morrison stated that no one has ever found a single artifact or any other convincing evidence for alien visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cia&#34;&gt;CIA &lt;a href=&#34;#cia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions that the CIA organized the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk the data collected by the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Project Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-white-house-position&#34;&gt;Official White House Position &lt;a href=&#34;#official-white-house-position&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the White House&amp;rsquo;s official response to petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge alien visits and disclose any withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. The response stated that the U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Counter Critique of the Official Position: Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the concept of a conspiracy of silence or an official cover-up suppressing information about UFOs. In 1968, James Harder argued that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs but had been suppressed. A 1971 survey showed that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs than believed in the existence of UFOs or the ETH itself. Former NASA astronauts, such as Gordon Cooper and Brian O&amp;rsquo;Leary, have commented on the government&amp;rsquo;s alleged suppression of UFO sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34;&gt;The Roswell Incident (1980 book) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; is a 1980 book by Charles Berlitz and William Moore that popularized stories of unusual debris recovered in 1947 by personnel from the Roswell Army Air Field. The book is available at the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the book by outlining the events of 1947 and the renewed interest in the Roswell incident in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;events-of-1947&#34;&gt;Events of 1947 &lt;a href=&#34;#events-of-1947&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial reports surrounding the Roswell incident, including the Roswell Army Air Field&amp;rsquo;s press release about recovering a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; and its subsequent retraction, claiming the object was a weather balloon. It also mentions the broader context of the &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze&amp;rdquo; of 1947, sparked by Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s alleged sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roswell-revisited&#34;&gt;Roswell revisited &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-revisited&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explains how the Roswell story gained renewed attention in 1978 when retired lieutenant colonel Jesse Marcel claimed in an interview with ufologist Stanton Friedman that he believed the debris he retrieved was of extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authors&#34;&gt;Authors &lt;a href=&#34;#authors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides background information on the authors of the book, Charles Berlitz and William Moore. It notes Berlitz&amp;rsquo;s previous success with &lt;em&gt;The Bermuda Triangle&lt;/em&gt;, a book that popularized the mysteries surrounding that area. It also mentions their collaboration on &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt;, which explored tales of a Navy invisibility experiment and government cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents &lt;a href=&#34;#contents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the book&amp;rsquo;s central argument: that an extraterrestrial craft crashed in the New Mexico desert while observing nuclear weapons activity, and the US government engaged in a cover-up. It highlights accounts of debris described as &amp;ldquo;nothing made on this earth&amp;rdquo; and mentions witnesses like Bill Brazel, Floyd Proctor, and Walt Whitman Jr. The section also notes that the book introduced the idea that the debris shown in photos with Marcel was substituted as part of a cover-up and that the press was not allowed to closely inspect the recovered material. The authors claimed to have interviewed over 90 witnesses, but only a fraction of their testimonies appear in the book. The incarceration of Mac Brazel is also mentioned as a form of witness intimidation. The section also points out that the book elevated Marcel&amp;rsquo;s narrative over that of Cavitt, whose description of the debris contradicted Marcel&amp;rsquo;s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-bodies&#34;&gt;Alien bodies &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-bodies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explains that &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; was the first book to introduce stories of civil engineer Grady &amp;ldquo;Barney&amp;rdquo; Barnett and archaeology students encountering wreckage and &amp;ldquo;alien bodies&amp;rdquo; on the Plains of San Agustin, far from the initial debris field near Corona. It also notes that some accounts of the Roswell incident contain information from the Aztec, New Mexico, UFO incident, a hoaxed flying saucer crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the critical reception of the book, noting that some critics deemed it &amp;ldquo;a collection of wild hearsay&amp;rdquo; and questioned the authenticity of the Majestic 12 documents, with some suspicion falling on Moore. It also mentions that the book did not achieve the commercial success its authors had hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions that Moore claimed to have engaged in &amp;ldquo;disinformation&amp;rdquo; activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-views&#34;&gt;Modern views &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section references the modern understanding of the Roswell incident. It mentions the 1993 inquiry from US congressman Steven Schiff, which led to a General Accounting Office investigation and an Air Force report concluding that the recovered material was likely debris from Project Mogul, a military surveillance program using high-altitude balloons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dover Demon</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_670cdf070164/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dover-demon&#34;&gt;Dover Demon &lt;a href=&#34;#dover-demon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dover Demon is a cryptid reportedly sighted in Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the reported sightings of the Dover Demon in April 1977. William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Bartlett, John Baxter, and Abby Brabham, all teenagers at the time, independently reported seeing a strange creature. Bartlett described it as a 4-foot tall creature with glowing orange eyes, a watermelon-shaped head, and no nose or mouth, seen on Farm Street. Baxter reported a similar sighting on Miller Hill Road, and Brabham claimed to have seen the creature on Springdale Avenue the following night. The teenagers drew sketches of the creature, with Bartlett swearing to the accuracy of his drawing. The locations of the sightings formed a straight line over 2 miles. The sightings became public in May, drawing comparisons to the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter. The Mutual UFO Network investigated the sightings, despite no UFOs being reported by the witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-explanations&#34;&gt;Possible explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the Dover Demon sightings. One suggestion is that the creature was a foal or a moose calf. Skeptic Joe Nickell proposes that the creature was likely a snowy owl, citing its size, plumage, and the reflection of headlights in its eyes. He suggests that the &amp;ldquo;long spindly arms&amp;rdquo; could have been the owl&amp;rsquo;s partially opened wings. Police suggested the sightings were a school vacation hoax. Skeptic Ben Radford suggests the sightings were influenced by the release of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the Dover Demon&amp;rsquo;s appearances in popular culture. It was featured in a 2009 episode of the television series &lt;em&gt;Lost Tapes&lt;/em&gt; on Animal Planet. The Dover Demon appears as a character in the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Perhapanauts&lt;/em&gt;, as well as in &lt;em&gt;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&lt;/em&gt;. It also appears in the webcomic &lt;em&gt;Gunnerkrigg Court&lt;/em&gt;. Additionally, an alien known as Dover Demon appears in the manga series &lt;em&gt;Dandadan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes &lt;a href=&#34;#notes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section contains a note that one proposed explanation of the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter is a great horned owl.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Test Tube Aliens</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/content/content_278a8fc6376c/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 23:37:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;test-tube-aliens&#34;&gt;Test Tube Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#test-tube-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the Test Tube Aliens toy line, detailing their story, features, and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;story&#34;&gt;Story &lt;a href=&#34;#story&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrative behind Test Tube Aliens involves two factions of aliens: the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; aliens from the dying planet Naratuko seeking a new home, and the &amp;ldquo;evil&amp;rdquo; aliens responsible for their planet&amp;rsquo;s destruction, pursuing them across the universe. The good aliens reverted to a pre-birth state to escape, sacrificing strength for intelligence. Later, the storyline was altered to reveal that all the original aliens were evil, with the &amp;ldquo;true good&amp;rdquo; aliens being the X series. The evil aliens aimed to contaminate water sources after being discarded. This was followed by the release of &amp;ldquo;Test Tube Aliens: Pure Evil,&amp;rdquo; featuring entirely evil aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-toy-itself&#34;&gt;The toy itself &lt;a href=&#34;#the-toy-itself&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toy consists of a test tube containing a &amp;ldquo;chrysalis&amp;rdquo; which, when water is added, dissolves to reveal an infant alien. The alien&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;heartbeat&amp;rdquo; is indicated by flashing lights. The alien requires feeding with &amp;ldquo;Sloog&amp;rdquo; (a powder mixed with water) initially, then tap water. It needs 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness daily to remain &amp;ldquo;healthy,&amp;rdquo; with the toy indicating if water levels are incorrect. If not cared for properly, the alien will &amp;ldquo;die.&amp;rdquo; The toy also interacted with a now-defunct website where users could check the alien&amp;rsquo;s health and induce coma or panic modes. A picture of Kurion, a good alien, is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works &lt;a href=&#34;#how-it-works&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alien&amp;rsquo;s body contains Polyacrylamide, a polymer that expands when it absorbs water. &amp;ldquo;Sloog&amp;rdquo; contains a weak acid that slows this expansion. Electrodes on the alien&amp;rsquo;s antenna and head sense the acid and water level, determining the alien&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;health.&amp;rdquo; A light detector in the alien&amp;rsquo;s head responds to flashes from the Test Tube Aliens website (no longer active) and tracks light/dark exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section lists the sources used in the article, including a Popular Mechanics blog post by Erik Sofge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;external-links&#34;&gt;External links &lt;a href=&#34;#external-links&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides a link to an archived version of the official Test Tube Aliens website.&lt;/p&gt;
