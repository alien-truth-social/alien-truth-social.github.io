<li>A second event was predicted for December 1994 in which over 250 people participated and which was declared by the leadership to have &ldquo;opened a portal to the AC (Ashtar Command) ships for ever&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The purpose of the lift-off is for the ascension of the human race as a whole, to which individual ascension is a precursor and an aid.</li>
<li>The collective ascension is being aided by large electronic grids deployed around the planet by the guardian ships.</li>

<li>Individual channelers espousing messages which differed and continued to focus on themes such as the destruction of Earth, conspiracies, extraterrestrial mass evacuations and general fear-mongering were declared invalid.</li>
<li>The new, more unified movement declared that in future no new channels would be accepted unless they operated on the &ldquo;level of the soul&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Channeled messages from Ashtar would be accepted as valid by the new orthodoxy if they complied with criteria consisting of a set of twelve guidelines which outlined what the movement stood for and how Ashtar would interact with society.</li>
<li>The new framework claimed that the millions of spaceships believed to be constantly in the vicinity of Earth would</li>
