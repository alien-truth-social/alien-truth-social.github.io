        <p>Okay, here&rsquo;s a comprehensive description of the Wikipedia article on Area 51, formatted in Markdown, with summaries of each section:</p>
<h1 id="area-51">Area 51 <a href="#area-51" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&rsquo;s a remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&rsquo;s widely believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF and CIA acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the subject of conspiracy theories and UFO folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Area 51 is located in southern Nevada, about 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography <a href="#geography" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section describes the physical location and layout of Area 51.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Area 51:</strong> The original rectangular base is 6 by 10 miles, part of the &ldquo;Groom box&rdquo; (23 by 25 miles) of restricted airspace. It&rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network. Groom Lake Road leads northeast, passing a security checkpoint, and eventually connects to State Route 375, the &ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&rdquo; south of Rachel, Nevada.</li>
<li><strong>Yucca Flat:</strong> Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, where many nuclear tests were conducted. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is southwest of Groom Lake.</li>
<li><strong>Groom Lake:</strong> A salt flat used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (XTA/KXTA). It&rsquo;s located in the Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, 25 miles south of Rachel, Nevada.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section details the historical development of Area 51.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin of the Name:</strong> The origin of the name &ldquo;Area 51&rdquo; is unclear.</li>
<li><strong>Early Names:</strong> The facility is officially called Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake. It has also been referred to as &ldquo;Dreamland&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Mining History:</strong> Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864. Mining continued until 1918 and resumed after World War II until the early 1950s.</li>
<li><strong>Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field:</strong> The airfield began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="u-2-program">U-2 Program <a href="#u-2-program" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section focuses on the establishment of Area 51 for the U-2 spy plane program.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CIA Establishment:</strong> The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE: the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Site Selection:</strong> Richard M. Bissell Jr. and Kelly Johnson selected Groom Lake as the ideal testing site due to its dry lake bed and remote location.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Paradise Ranch&rdquo;:</strong> Johnson named the area &ldquo;Paradise Ranch&rdquo; to encourage workers to move to the remote location.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Infrastructure:</strong> The Ranch initially consisted of shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. By July 1955, it had a paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and accommodations for test personnel.</li>
<li><strong>U-2 Delivery:</strong> The first U-2 delivery arrived on 24 July 1955. Regular flights were set up between Area 51 and Lockheed&rsquo;s offices in Burbank, California.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oxcart-program">OXCART Program <a href="#oxcart-program" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section describes the expansion of Area 51 for the Lockheed A-12 (OXCART) program.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project OXCART:</strong> Established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12.</li>
<li><strong>Construction:</strong> Construction of &ldquo;Project 51&rdquo; began in September 1960, including a new 8,500 ft runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) upgraded base facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Runways:</strong> A new 10,000 ft runway (14/32) was built, and an Archimedean spiral (&ldquo;The Hook&rdquo;) was marked on the dry lake.</li>
<li><strong>Facilities:</strong> By August 1961, essential facilities were complete, including hangars, workshops, administration buildings, a commissary, a control tower, a fire station, and housing.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Security was enhanced, and the FAA expanded the restricted airspace.</li>
<li><strong>Aircraft:</strong> The CIA facility received various USAF aircraft for training and support.</li>
<li><strong>First Flight:</strong> The first A-12 test aircraft arrived in February 1962 and made its first flight on 26 April 1962.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-21-tagboard">D-21 Tagboard <a href="#d-21-tagboard" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section details the testing of the Lockheed D-21 drone program at Area 51.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>D-21 Development:</strong> Following the loss of Gary Powers&rsquo; U-2, the Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The project designated &ldquo;Q-12&rdquo; was renamed the &ldquo;D-21&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>M-21 Launch Platform:</strong> The D-21 was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the &ldquo;M-21&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Testing Difficulties:</strong> Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues.</li>
<li><strong>First Launch:</strong> The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight.</li>
<li><strong>Accident:</strong> An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21 caused it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>B-52H Launch Platform:</strong> Kelly Johnson proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber.</li>
<li><strong>Test Flights:</strong> Several more tests, including two over China, were made from Beale AFB, California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success.</li>
<li><strong>Program Cancellation:</strong> On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> The remaining drones were transferred by a C-5A and placed in dead storage at the Davis-Monthan AFB Military Storage and Disposition Center.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="foreign-technology-evaluation">Foreign Technology Evaluation <a href="#foreign-technology-evaluation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>This section describes the testing of captured Soviet fighter aircraft at Area 51 during the Cold War.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL, HAVE FERRY:</strong> Munir Redfa&rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 from Iraq for Israel&rsquo;s Mossad in Operation Diamond led to these programs.</li>
<li><strong>Testing:</strong> The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters.</li>
<li><strong>Air Force Systems Command:</strong> The focus of Air Force Systems Command limited the use of the fighter as a tool with which to train the front line tactical fighter pilots.</li>
<li><strong>HAVE DOUGHNUT:</strong> In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet-made aircraft in simulated air combat training.</li>
<li><strong>MiG-17s:</strong> On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of MiG-17Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel.</li>
<li><strong>Top Gun:</strong> The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed Top Gun school at NAS Miramar.</li>
<li><strong>HAVE IDEA:</strong> In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed, which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects, and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport.</li>
<li><strong>HAVE GLIB:</strong> Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. This involved testing Soviet tracking and missile control radar systems.</li>
<li><strong>SCORE EVENT:</strong> The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT.</li>
<li><strong>CIA Transfer:</strong> In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California.</li>
<li><strong>2017 Crash:</strong> In 2017, a USAF aircraft crashed at the site, killing the pilot, Lt. Colonel Eric &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Schultz.</li>
