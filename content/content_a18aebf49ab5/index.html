        <h1 id="unidentified-flying-object-ufo">Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) <a href="#unidentified-flying-object-ufo" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be immediately identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and escalated during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained. Government investigations and studies by organizations and individuals have occurred over the years, but there is no confirmation of claims that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence or other unconventional hypotheses. Scientists and skeptic organizations often attribute UFOs to natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. The ongoing interest in UFOs is seen by social scientists as a modern example of folklore and mythology. The U.S. government has entities dedicated to UFO data collection and analysis: NASA&rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the Department of Defence All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology <a href="#terminology" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were often called &ldquo;flying saucers&rdquo; or &ldquo;flying discs&rdquo; based on the Kenneth Arnold incident. The term &ldquo;unidentified flying object&rdquo; (UFO) has been in use since 1947. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt coined the acronym &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; for the USAF. &ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&rdquo; (UAP) first appeared in the late 1960s and has seen increasing usage in the 21st century. While technically a <em>UFO</em> refers to any unidentified flying object, in modern popular culture the term UFO has generally become synonymous with alien spacecraft. The term &ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to separate this explanation of UFOs from totally earthbound explanations.</p>
<h2 id="identification">Identification <a href="#identification" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Studies show that after careful investigation, the majority of UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. The 1952â€“1955 study for the USAF used categories such as &ldquo;Balloon; Astronomical; Aircraft; Light phenomenon; Birds, Clouds, dust, etc.; Insufficient information; Psychological manifestations; Unknown; and Other&rdquo;. Identified sources of UFO reports include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. A 1979 study by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry found that fewer than one percent of cases he investigated were hoaxes and most sightings were actually honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi advised his students to apply critical thinking to UFO claims, stating that the more you investigate, the more likely you are to find that there is LESS to these stories than meets the eye.</p>
<h2 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id="early-history-before-the-20th-century">Early history before the 20th century <a href="#early-history-before-the-20th-century" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. Halley&rsquo;s Comet, first recorded by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC, was often treated as a supernatural portent or omen. Some examples of pre-contemporary reports about unusual aerial phenomena include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Julius Obsequens, a Roman writer, made references to things moving through the sky in his <em>Liber de prodigiis</em>.</li>
<li>Shen Kuo (1031â€“1095), a Song Chinese government official, wrote about an unidentified flying object in his <em>Dream Pool Essays</em> (1088).</li>
<li>A woodcut by Hans Glaser in 1561 depicts the &ldquo;celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg,&rdquo; which has been connected to ancient astronaut claims.</li>
<li>A similar report comes from 1566 over Basel.</li>
<li>On January 25, 1878, the <em>Denison Daily News</em> printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, had reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying &ldquo;at wonderful speed&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="20th-century-and-after">20th century and after <a href="#20th-century-and-after" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In the Pacific and European theatres during World War II, round, glowing fireballs known as &ldquo;foo fighters&rdquo; were reported by Allied and Axis pilots. In 1946, more than 2,000 reports were collected, primarily by the Swedish military, of unidentified aerial objects over the Scandinavian nations, along with isolated reports from France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. The objects were referred to as &ldquo;Russian hail&rdquo; (and later as &ldquo;ghost rockets&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The popular UFO craze in the US began with a media frenzy surrounding the reports on June 24, 1947, of a civilian pilot named Kenneth Arnold who described seeing &ldquo;a group of bat-like aircraft flying in formation at high speeds&rdquo; near Mount Rainier that he said were &ldquo;moving like a saucer would if skipped across water&rdquo; which led to headlines about &ldquo;flying saucers&rdquo; and &ldquo;flying discs&rdquo;. Within weeks, reports of flying saucer sightings became a daily occurrence with one particularly famous example being the Roswell incident in 1947. In 1950, three influential books were publishedâ€”Donald Keyhoe&rsquo;s <em>The Flying Saucers Are Real</em>, Frank Scully&rsquo;s <em>Behind the Flying Saucers</em>, and Gerald Heard&rsquo;s <em>The Riddle of the Flying Saucers</em>.</p>
<p>Media accounts and speculation ran rampant in the U.S., especially in connection to the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. so that, by 1953, the intelligence officials worried that &ldquo;genuine incursions&rdquo; by enemy aircraft &ldquo;over U.S. territory could be lost in a maelstrom of kooky hallucination&rdquo; of UFO reports. The cultural phenomenon showed up within some intellectual works such as the 1959 publication of <em>Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky</em> by Carl Jung.</p>
<p>Starting in 1947, the U.S. Air Force began to record and investigated UFO reports with Project Sign looking into &ldquo;more than 250 cases&rdquo; from 1947 to 1949. It was replaced by Project Grudge up through 1951. In the third U.S. Air Force program, from March 1952 to its termination in December 1969, &ldquo;the U.S. Air Force cataloged 12,618 sightings of UFOs as part of what is now known as Project Blue Book&rdquo;. Official U.S. Air Force interest in UFO reports went on hiatus in 1969 after a study by the University of Colorado led by Edward U. Condon and known as the Condon Report concluded &ldquo;that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge&rdquo; and that further time investigating UFO reports &ldquo;cannot be justified&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs were part of American popular culture&rsquo;s obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. In 1961, the first alien abduction account was sensationalized when Barney and Betty Hill underwent hypnosis after seeing a UFO and reported recovered memories of their experience that became ever more elaborate as the years went by.</p>
<p>In December 2017, a new round of media attention started when <em>The New York Times</em> broke the story of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program that was funded from 2007 to 2012 with $22 million spent on the program. Following this story, along with a series of sensationalized Pentagon UFO videos leaked by members of the program who became convinced that UFOs were genuine mysteries worth investigating, there was an increase in mainstream attention to UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the creation of his Galileo Project which intended to use high-tech astronomical equipment to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts in space and possibly within Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Two government sponsored programs, NASA&rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were charged in part by Congressional fiat to investigate UFO claims more fully, adopting the new moniker &ldquo;unexplained aerial phenomenon&rdquo; (UAP) to avoid associations with past sensationalism. On 17 May 2022, members of the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation held congressional hearings with top military officials to discuss military reports of UAPs. Another Congressional hearing took place on July 26, 2023, featuring the whistleblower claims of former U.S. Air Force (USAF) officer and intelligence official David Grusch.</p>
<p>A Harris Poll in 2009 found that 32% of Americans &ldquo;believe in UFOs&rdquo;. A <em>National Geographic</em> study in June 2012 found that 36% of Americans believe UFOs exist and that 10% thought that they had spotted one. In June 2021 a Pew research poll found that 51% in the United States thought that UFOs reported by people in the military were likely to be evidence of intelligent life from beyond the Earth.</p>
