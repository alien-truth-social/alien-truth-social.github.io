        <h1 id="ancient-astronauts">Ancient Astronauts <a href="#ancient-astronauts" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced the development of human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected modern cultures, technologies, religions, and human biology. A common idea is that deities from religions are extraterrestrial in origin, and advanced technologies were seen as divine by early humans. Academics and archaeologists dismiss these claims as pseudoarchaeological or unscientific, lacking credible peer-reviewed studies. Some argue that these theories have racist undertones, diminishing the accomplishments of indigenous cultures.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview <a href="#overview" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI. Believers often claim that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence who landed on Earth in the past. They also suggest that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these ancient extraterrestrial visitors, who acted as a &ldquo;mother culture.&rdquo; Proponents argue that aliens built or aided in building structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island. Evidence is said to come from documentary gaps in historical and archaeological records, as well as artifacts believed to be anachronistic and beyond the technical capabilities of ancient people.</p>
<p>The idea is considered pseudoarcheology and is featured in fringe media like the History Channel series <em>Ancient Aliens</em>. Such shows mix fact with fiction to promote theories of an alternate past, often aligning with white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents portray themselves as an oppressed minority of academics, claiming a conspiracy by &lsquo;big archaeology&rsquo; to disenfranchise them. They focus on monumental archaeological structures, implying that non-white indigenous people could not have built them without extraterrestrial intervention. However, some indigenous voices argue that the idea of extraterrestrials supports their own origin stories. A common feature is the portrayal of aliens as light-skinned or Aryan, as claimed by Erich von DÃ¤niken.</p>
<h1 id="history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents">History of Ancient Aliens Beliefs and Their Proponents <a href="#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Paleocontact narratives first appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It gained popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and the success of Erich von DÃ¤niken&rsquo;s works. Critics emerged in the 1970s, discrediting Von DÃ¤niken&rsquo;s claims. By the early 1980s, support for the idea dwindled.</p>
<h2 id="shklovskii-and-sagan">Shklovskii and Sagan <a href="#shklovskii-and-sagan" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Carl Sagan and Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky co-authored <em>Intelligent Life in the Universe</em> in 1966. Sagan later expressed disapproval of writers like von DÃ¤niken who built on their ideas without caution, presenting them as valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact. Sagan pointed out that many legends, artifacts, and purported out-of-place artifacts cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses could be easily explained with more conventional hypotheses.</p>
<h2 id="erich-von-dÃ¤niken">Erich von DÃ¤niken <a href="#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Erich von DÃ¤niken became a leading proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis in the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining a large audience through his book <em>Chariots of the Gods?</em> According to von DÃ¤niken, certain artifacts required more sophisticated technology than was available to the ancient cultures that constructed them. He maintained that these artifacts were constructed either directly by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from them. These include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.</p>
<p>Von DÃ¤niken wrote that ancient art and iconography throughout the world illustrate air and space vehicles, non-human but intelligent creatures, ancient astronauts, and artifacts of anachronistically advanced technology. He also stated that geographically separated historical cultures share artistic themes, implying a common origin. One example is his interpretation of the sarcophagus lid from the tomb of Pacal the Great in Palenque, which he saw as representing a seated astronaut. He interpreted the origins of many religions as reactions to encounters with an alien race, viewing the aliens&rsquo; technology as supernatural and the aliens themselves as gods.</p>
<p>Critics argue that von DÃ¤niken misrepresented data, that many of his claims were unfounded, and that none of his core claims have been validated.</p>
<h2 id="zecharia-sitchin">Zecharia Sitchin <a href="#zecharia-sitchin" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Zecharia Sitchin&rsquo;s series <em>The Earth Chronicles</em>, beginning with <em>The 12th Planet</em>, revolves around Sitchin&rsquo;s interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts. He hypothesized that the gods of old Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet &ldquo;Nibiru,&rdquo; which the Sumerians believed to be a remote &ldquo;12th planet&rdquo; associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit.</p>
<p>Sitchin argued that Sumerian texts tell the story that 50 Anunnaki from Nibiru came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago to mine raw materials, especially gold. They eventually created <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>: the &ldquo;Adapa&rdquo; (model man) or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the abrupt end of the last ice age some 12,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Sitchin&rsquo;s work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been criticized by professionals. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&rsquo;s translations of Sumerian and Mesopotamian words are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries.</p>
<h2 id="robert-temple">Robert Temple <a href="#robert-temple" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Robert K. G. Temple&rsquo;s 1976 book, <em>The Sirius Mystery,</em> argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Sumer. His work draws heavily on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.</p>
<p>His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies within Temple&rsquo;s account, and suggested that the Dogon may have received some of their astronomical information recently, probably from European sources, and may have misrepresented Dogon ethnography.</p>
<h2 id="ufo-religions">UFO Religions <a href="#ufo-religions" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Various new religious movements including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, RaÃ«lism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&rsquo;s Gate believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these faiths see both ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens from other planetary systems. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities which suggest that members of these groups consciously or subliminally associate enchantment with the memes of science fiction.</p>
<h1 id="claims-of-proponents">Claims of Proponents <a href="#claims-of-proponents" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Scientists generally agree that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &ldquo;mysteries&rdquo; cited as evidence can be explained without invoking ancient astronauts. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&rsquo;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.</p>
<h2 id="ancient-religious-texts">Ancient Religious Texts <a href="#ancient-religious-texts" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Proponents cite ancient mythologies to support their viewpoints, suggesting that ancient creation myths of gods descending from the heavens to Earth to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors. They draw an analogy to occurrences in modern time when isolated cultures are exposed to advanced technology, such as when &ldquo;cargo cults&rdquo; were discovered in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>The ancient Sumerian myth of <em>EnÃ»ma EliÅ¡</em>, inscribed on cuneiform tablets and part of the Library of Ashurbanipal, says humankind was created to serve gods called the &ldquo;<em>Annunaki</em>&rdquo;. Hypothesis proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to Earth to mine gold for their own uses and then created the human race as slaves.</p>
<h3 id="ramayana">Ramayana <a href="#ramayana" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel in flying vehicles called Vimana. There are many mentions of these flying objects in the <em>Ramayana</em>. Erich von DÃ¤niken discusses the <em>Ramayana</em> and the <em>vimanas</em> in <em>Chariots of the Gods?</em> suggesting that they were &ldquo;space vehicles&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="the-bible">The Bible <a href="#the-bible" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><h4 id="book-of-genesis-and-book-of-enoch">Book of Genesis and Book of Enoch <a href="#book-of-genesis-and-book-of-enoch" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h4><p>The Book of Genesis, Chapter 6 verses 1â€“2 and 4, states that the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. The Nephilim were on the earth in those days when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. Ancient Astronaut proponents argue that Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit in order &ldquo;to be godlike&rdquo;, and this was the first step in human evolution.</p>
<p>The first part of the apocryphal Book of Enoch expands and interprets Genesis 6:1: that the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; were a group of 200 &ldquo;angels&rdquo; called &ldquo;Watchers&rdquo;, who descended to Earth to breed with humans. Their offspring are the Nephilim, &ldquo;giants&rdquo; who &ldquo;consumed all the acquisitions of men&rdquo;. The Watchers also instructed humans in metallurgy and metalworking, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. God then ordered the Watchers to be imprisoned in the ground, and created the Great Flood to rid Earth of the Nephilim and of the humans given knowledge by the Watch</p>
