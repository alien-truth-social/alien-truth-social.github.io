        <h1 id="area-51">Area 51 <a href="#area-51" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&rsquo;s a remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&rsquo;s widely believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it a central subject of conspiracy theories and UFO folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.</p>
<h1 id="geography">Geography <a href="#geography" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><h2 id="area-51-1">Area 51 <a href="#area-51-1" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The original rectangular base is part of the &ldquo;Groom box,&rdquo; a restricted airspace area. It&rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with roads leading to Mercury and Yucca Flat. Groom Lake Road runs northeast through the Jumbled Hills, past a security checkpoint, and eventually connects with State Route 375, the &ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&rdquo; south of Rachel, Nevada. Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, the location of many nuclear tests. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is southwest of Groom Lake.</p>
<h2 id="groom-lake">Groom Lake <a href="#groom-lake" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Groom Lake is a salt flat in Nevada used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (XTA/KXTA) on the north of the Area 51 USAF military installation. It&rsquo;s located within the Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, south of Rachel, Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>The origin of the name &ldquo;Area 51&rdquo; is unclear. The facility has also been referred to as &ldquo;Dreamland&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&rdquo; The special use airspace around the field is referred to as Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N). Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864, and mining continued until the early 1950s. The airfield on the Groom Lake site began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.</p>
<h2 id="u-2-program">U-2 program <a href="#u-2-program" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE: the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Project director Richard M. Bissell Jr. chose Groom Lake as the testing site due to its secrecy and ideal location. Lockheed&rsquo;s Kelly Johnson named the area &ldquo;Paradise Ranch&rdquo; to encourage workers to move there. The Ranch initially consisted of shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. The base received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955.</p>
<h2 id="oxcart-program">OXCART program <a href="#oxcart-program" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Project OXCART was established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12. Construction of A-12 test facilities began in September 1960, including a new runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) upgraded base facilities and built a new runway diagonally across the lakebed. The CIA facility received eight USAF F-101 Voodoos for training, two T-33 Shooting Star trainers, a C-130 Hercules for cargo transport, a U-3A, a helicopter, and a Cessna 180. Lockheed provided an F-104 Starfighter. The first A-12 test aircraft arrived at Groom Lake on 28 February 1962 and made its first flight 26 April 1962. Groom was also the site of the first Lockheed D-21 drone test flight on 22 December 1964. By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA-operated &ldquo;1129th Special Activities Squadron&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="d-21-tagboard">D-21 Tagboard <a href="#d-21-tagboard" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Following the loss of Gary Powers&rsquo; U-2 over the Soviet Union, there were discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. The project was designated &ldquo;Q-12&rdquo;, later renamed the &ldquo;D-21&rdquo;. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21 caused it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. Kelly Johnson cancelled the program. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program.</p>
<h2 id="foreign-technology-evaluation">Foreign technology evaluation <a href="#foreign-technology-evaluation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>During the Cold War, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Munir Redfa&rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 led to the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters. In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in late 1967 for study. In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT. On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of MiG-17Fs on a training mission and landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel. Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed, which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects, and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport. Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. In 2017, a USAF aircraft crashed at the site, killing the pilot, Lt. Colonel Eric &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Schultz.</p>
<h2 id="have-bluef-117-program">Have Blue/F-117 program <a href="#have-bluef-117-program" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter first flew at Groom in December 1977. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full-scale development (FSD) prototype, designated YF-117A. On 18 June 1981 Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A off the runway of Area 51. Tactical Air Command (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group, which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at Nellis AFB, Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. On 15 October 1982, Major Alton C. Whitley Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A. Tonopah Test Range Airport was selected for operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the 4450th Tactical Group (TG). By early 1982, four more YF-117As were operating at the base. Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Area 51 until mid-1981 when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Area 51 by C-5 during darkness to maintain security. While the &ldquo;Baja Scorpions&rdquo; were working on the F-117, there was also another group at work in secrecy, known as &ldquo;the Whalers&rdquo; working on Tacit Blue. On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. The R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. In 1990, the last F-117A was delivered from Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Area 51 to the USAF Palmdale Plant 42 and was integrated with the Air Force Systems Command 6510th Test Squadron.</p>
<h2 id="later-operations">Later operations <a href="#later-operations" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Since the F-117 became operational in 1983, operations at Groom Lake have continued. The base and its associated runway system were expanded. In 1995, the federal government expanded the exclusionary area around the base.</p>

The area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits to both civilian and normal military air traffic.
