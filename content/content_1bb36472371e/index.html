        <h1 id="area-51">Area 51 <a href="#area-51" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&rsquo;s a remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&rsquo;s believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF and CIA acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the subject of conspiracy theories and UFO folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. It&rsquo;s located in southern Nevada, 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography <a href="#geography" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="area-51-1">Area 51 <a href="#area-51-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The original rectangular base is part of the &ldquo;Groom box,&rdquo; a rectangular area of restricted airspace. It&rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with roads leading to Mercury and Yucca Flat. Groom Lake Road runs northeast through the Jumbled Hills, past a security checkpoint, and descends to the Tikaboo Valley, converging with State Route 375, the &ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&rdquo; south of Rachel. Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, the location of numerous nuclear tests. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is southwest of Groom Lake.</p>
<h3 id="groom-lake">Groom Lake <a href="#groom-lake" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Groom Lake is a salt flat in Nevada used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (XTA/KXTA) on the north of the Area 51 USAF military installation. The lake is approximately 3+3‚ÅÑ4 mi (6 km) from north to south and 3 mi (5 km) from east to west at its widest point. It is located within the Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, 25 mi (40 km) south of Rachel, Nevada.</p>
<h2 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The origin of the name &ldquo;Area 51&rdquo; is unclear. The correct names for the facility are Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake. The facility has also been referred to as &ldquo;Dreamland&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&rdquo; The special use airspace around the field is referred to as Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N). Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864, and mining continued until the early 1950s. The airfield began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.</p>
<h3 id="u-2-program">U-2 program <a href="#u-2-program" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE: the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Project director Richard M. Bissell Jr. chose Groom Lake as the testing site. Kelly Johnson, Lockheed&rsquo;s U-2 designer, found the lake bed ideal for testing aircraft. The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated &ldquo;Area 51,&rdquo; and add it to the Nevada Test Site. Johnson named the area &ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&rdquo; The Ranch initially consisted of shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. By July 1955, the base consisted of a paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and accommodations for test personnel. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955.</p>
<h3 id="oxcart-program">OXCART program <a href="#oxcart-program" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Project OXCART was established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12. This included testing at Groom Lake, which had inadequate facilities. A-12 test facility construction began in September 1960, including a new runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) began construction of &ldquo;Project 51&rdquo; on 1 October 1960. The contractor upgraded base facilities and built a new 10,000 ft (3,000 m) runway. They marked an Archimedean spiral on the dry lake. By August 1961, construction of the essential facilities was complete. A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed by early 1962 for the special JP-7 fuel required by the A-12. Security was enhanced, and the FAA expanded the restricted airspace. The CIA facility received various USAF aircraft for training and support. The first A-12 test aircraft arrived at Groom Lake on 28 February 1962 and made its first flight 26 April 1962. Groom was also the site of the first Lockheed D-21 drone test flight on 22 December 1964. By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA-operated &ldquo;1129th Special Activities Squadron&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="d-21-tagboard">D-21 Tagboard <a href="#d-21-tagboard" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Following the loss of Gary Powers&rsquo; U-2 over the Soviet Union, there were discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. The Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The project designated &ldquo;Q-12&rdquo; was renamed the &ldquo;D-21&rdquo;. &ldquo;Tagboard&rdquo; was the project&rsquo;s code name. The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the &ldquo;M-21&rdquo;. Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21 caused it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft, resulting in one crew member drowning. Kelly Johnson cancelled the entire program. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and Johnson proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber. Several more tests, including two over China, were made from Beale AFB, California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program.</p>
<h3 id="foreign-technology-evaluation">Foreign technology evaluation <a href="#foreign-technology-evaluation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>During the Cold War, one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured Soviet fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Munir Redfa&rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 from Iraq for Israel&rsquo;s Mossad in Operation Diamond led to the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters. In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in late 1967 for study. In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet-made aircraft in simulated air combat training. On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel with a pair of MiG-17s. Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed Top Gun school at NAS Miramar. In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed, which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects, and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport. Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. In 2017, a USAF aircraft crashed at the site, killing the pilot, Lt. Colonel Eric &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Schultz.</p>
<h3 id="have-bluef-117-program">Have Blue/F-117 program <a href="#have-bluef-117-program" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter first flew at Groom in December 1977. In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation&rsquo;s Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full-scale development (FSD) prototype 79‚Äì780, designated YF-117A. On 18 June 198</p>
