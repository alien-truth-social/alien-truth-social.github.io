        <h1 id="cattle-mutilation">Cattle Mutilation <a href="#cattle-mutilation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle (and other animals) under unusual and often bloodless circumstances. The phenomenon is often linked to paranormal or supernatural explanations, including cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. The article notes that similar mutilations have been observed in other livestock and wild animals, with specific body parts often removed. Two independent federal investigations in the United States have been conducted on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="early-history">Early History <a href="#early-history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The earliest documented outbreak of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in England in 1606. Later, Charles Fort collected accounts of cattle mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<h2 id="the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967">The &ldquo;Snippy&rdquo; Horse Death of 1967 <a href="#the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section focuses on the 1967 case of a horse named &ldquo;Snippy&rdquo; found mutilated in Alamosa, Colorado. The Pueblo Chieftain published a story about the incident, which gained national attention and sparked speculation about extraterrestrial involvement. Agnes King and her son Harry found the horse&rsquo;s body, noting the precise cuts and lack of blood. Wadsworth Ayer investigated for the Condon Committee and concluded there was no evidence of abnormal causes. Sheriff Ben Phillips suggested a lightning strike as the cause.</p>
<h2 id="cattle-mutilations-19731980">Cattle Mutilations 1973â€“1980 <a href="#cattle-mutilations-19731980" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This section covers a wave of cattle mutilations reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico during the 1970s. It mentions reports of unidentified helicopters involved in cattle rustling in Iowa and Missouri in 1973.</p>
<h3 id="1973-kansas-wave">1973 Kansas Wave <a href="#1973-kansas-wave" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about suspicious phone calls from someone posing as a USDA official. Several butchered cows were found on farms in the area, with right ears removed. Local press speculated about a &ldquo;Mad Dog&rdquo; or &ldquo;phantom&rdquo; butcher. By December, law enforcement reported investigating 40 mutilations across Kansas and Nebraska. State Senator Ross Doyen also reported a mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&rsquo;s office attributed most deaths to natural causes, a conclusion disputed by Modlin.</p>
<h3 id="1974-nebraska-wave">1974 Nebraska Wave <a href="#1974-nebraska-wave" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Reports of mutilations resumed in April 1974 in Nebraska. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations and helicopter sightings. Mutilations were reported in Iowa and Nebraska counties. In Custer County, there were reports of helicopter sightings and armed patrols. An unidentified helicopter was spotted shining a spotlight above a field where a mutilated cow was later found near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported armed civilian patrols. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation leaned toward predators as the cause. State Sen. John Decamp called for a coordinated investigation. By late August, 25 mutilations were reported across five Nebraska counties. Authorities cautioned the public against shooting at aircraft. A meeting of law enforcement officials from 24 counties was held to discuss the mutilations.</p>
<h3 id="1975-colorado">1975 Colorado <a href="#1975-colorado" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&rsquo;s top story in 1975. Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI, claiming 130 mutilations in Colorado and reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing $1 million in damages. Donald E. Flickinger of the Michigan ATF investigated possible links to a &ldquo;Hell-oriented biker gang.&rdquo; The Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside.</p>
<h3 id="1976-dulce-new-mexico">1976 Dulce, New Mexico <a href="#1976-dulce-new-mexico" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In June 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.</p>
<h3 id="1979-public-meeting">1979 Public Meeting <a href="#1979-public-meeting" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In April 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. Paul Bennewitz reported seeing unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. Gabe Valdez reported finding tranquilizers in the remains of a mutilated bull. In June 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with radar chaff nearby.</p>
<h2 id="later-incidents">Later Incidents <a href="#later-incidents" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since 1967, especially in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics <a href="#characteristics" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Unusual cattle deaths are characterized by the absence of sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, rectum, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts are described as &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and &ldquo;surgical.&rdquo; Some animals are reported to have been drained of blood with no sign of blood in the area. Nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. Strange marks or imprints near the site have been found.</p>
<h3 id="laboratory-reports">Laboratory Reports <a href="#laboratory-reports" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Laboratory reports on some mutilated animals have shown unusual levels of vitamins or minerals and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. In a case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI involving a bull belonging to Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, the animal displayed classic mutilation signs. The animal&rsquo;s heart, bone, and muscle samples were sent to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, while liver samples were sent to private laboratories. The liver was found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain high levels of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Blood samples did not clot, and the hide was unusually brittle.</p>
<h3 id="helicopter-sightings">Helicopter Sightings <a href="#helicopter-sightings" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In July 1974, two unregistered helicopters reportedly opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. in Honey Creek, Iowa. In August 1974, residents reported seeing unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter. In April 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft resembling a U.S. military helicopter.</p>
<h2 id="official-investigations">Official Investigations <a href="#official-investigations" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms <a href="#bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In January 1975, the ATF launched an investigation headed by Agent Donald Flickinger to investigate possible connections between cults and cattle mutilation. Flickinger recorded unusual incidents but found insufficient evidence of cult involvement.</p>
<h3 id="colorado-bureau-of-investigation">Colorado Bureau of Investigation <a href="#colorado-bureau-of-investigation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. 19 animals underwent necropsies at Colorado State University, but no conclusive results emerged.</p>
<h3 id="new-mexico-state-police">New Mexico State Police <a href="#new-mexico-state-police" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In June 1976, the New Mexico State Police began an investigation headed by Officer Gabe Valdez. Valdez solicited assistance from retired Sandia National Laboratories scientist Howard Burgess. The investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant.</p>
<h3 id="rommel-investigation">Rommel Investigation <a href="#rommel-investigation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Beginning in May 1979, an investigation was funded by a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and headed by retired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel. Rommel&rsquo;s report concluded that the mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but some cases contained anomalies that could not be accounted for.</p>
<h2 id="conventional-explanations">Conventional Explanations <a href="#conventional-explanations" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>There are several potential explanations for cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.</p>
<h3 id="natural-causes">Natural Causes <a href="#natural-causes" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Missing or mutilated body parts are explained as the actions of scavengers, parasites, and dehydration. Absence of blood is explained as blood pooling or consumption by insects. Surgical incisions are explained as tears in the skin due to bloating or dehydration.</p>
<h3 id="animal-cruelty-pranks-and-hoaxes">Animal Cruelty, Pranks, and Hoaxes <a href="#animal-cruelty-pranks-and-hoaxes" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Cattle mutilations are hypothesized to be the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies are the work of humans who derive pleasure from mutilating animals.</p>
<h3 id="covert-monitoring-of-threats-to-public-health">Covert Monitoring of Threats to Public Health <a href="#covert-monitoring-of-threats-to-public-health" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Cattle mutilations might be the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases. Colm Kelleher argues that the mutilations are a clandestine U.S. government effort to track the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (&ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;). Greg Valdez concludes that mutilations were a government testing program looking at the after-effects of radiation from 1967&rsquo;s Project Gasbuggy.</p>
<h3 id="secret-weapons-testing">Secret Weapons Testing <a href="#secret-weapons-testing" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The government was testing cattle parts to develop biological weapons. In March 1968, 6,000 sheep were killed as part of chemical weapons testing.</p>
<h2 id="other-explanations">Other Explanations <a href="#other-explanations" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Fringe explanations for the mutilation have blamed satanic cults, aliens, or even mythical monsters.</p>
<h3 id="satanic-cults">Satanic Cults <a href="#satanic-cults" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity. However, the FBI and the ATF were unable to find appropriate evidence to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort.</p>
<h3 id="aliens">Aliens <a href="#aliens" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Press had linked reports of unidentified aircraft to UFOs and flying saucers. In 1974, farmers in Nebraska claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. In 1980, journalist Linda Moulton Howe claimed the mutilations were linked to UFOs and aliens. The 2013 documentary <em>Mirage Men</em> suggests there was conspiracy by the U.S. military to fabricate UFO folklore. Paul Bennewitz was introduced to highway patrol officer Gabe Valdez at a public meeting about the ongoing cattle mutilations.</p>
