        <h1 id="cattle-mutilation">Cattle Mutilation <a href="#cattle-mutilation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle (and other animals) under unusual and anomalous circumstances, often described as bloodless. The phenomenon is frequently linked to paranormal or supernatural explanations, including cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. The article notes that it has been the subject of two independent federal investigations in the United States.</p>
<h2 id="early-history">Early History <a href="#early-history" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The earliest documented cases of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in England in 1606. Charles Fort collected accounts of cattle mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<h3 id="the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967">The &ldquo;Snippy&rdquo; Horse Death of 1967 <a href="#the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The unexplained death and mutilation of a horse named &ldquo;Snippy&rdquo; in Alamosa, Colorado, in 1967 brought the phenomenon to wider attention. The case involved precise cuts, a lack of blood, and a medicinal odor. This incident was the first to link mutilations to extraterrestrials and UFOs. Wadsworth Ayer&rsquo;s investigation for the Condon Committee concluded there was no evidence of abnormal causes. Alamosa County Sheriff Ben Phillips suggested a lightning strike, but later reports mentioned the horse had been shot. Two students confessed to shooting the horse after the case gained publicity.</p>
<h2 id="cattle-mutilations-19731980">Cattle Mutilations 1973â€“1980 <a href="#cattle-mutilations-19731980" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This period saw waves of cattle mutilations reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico. In April 1973, sheriffs in Western Iowa reported unidentified helicopters involved in cattle and pig rustling. Similar rustling was reported in Missouri in August.</p>
<h3 id="1973-kansas-wave">1973 Kansas Wave <a href="#1973-kansas-wave" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about suspicious phone calls from someone posing as a USDA official. A series of butchered cows were found on farms in Cloud County, with right ears removed. Local press speculated about a &ldquo;Mad Dog&rdquo; or &ldquo;phantom&rdquo; Butcher. By December, law enforcement reported a wave of cattle deaths in seven counties across Kansas and Nebraska, with sexual organs removed. State Senator Ross Doyen reported a cattle mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&rsquo;s office attributed most deaths to natural causes, but Modlin and others disagreed.</p>
<h3 id="1974-nebraska-wave">1974 Nebraska Wave <a href="#1974-nebraska-wave" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Reports resumed in April 1974, with a Nebraska cow found mutilated and drained of blood. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations and unidentified helicopter sightings. Mutilations were reported in Mills County, Iowa, and Lancaster County, Nebraska. Custer County reported helicopter sightings and armed patrols. In August, an unidentified helicopter was spotted hovering above a field where a mutilated cow was later found near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported armed civilian patrols. Cloud County Attorney William Walsh mentioned a jailhouse informant who claimed the mutilations were the result of devil-worshiping cultists. State Sen. John Decamp called for a coordinated investigation. A rancher near Hartington apparently thwarted a mutilation in progress when he found a helicopter above his field. Authorities cautioned the public not to shoot at aircraft. The University of Nebraska&rsquo;s Department of Veterinary Science disproved three mutilations, attributing them to natural causes. Law enforcement officials from 24 counties attended a meeting in Center, Nebraska, to discuss the mutilations. Three cases of alleged mutilations were reported in South Dakota. Newsweek became the first national outlet to cover the story, reporting 100 cattle mutilated in Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa since May. South Dakota Attorney General Kermit Sande reported mutilations in the state. UFO expert J. Allen Hynek denied any link between UFOs and mutilations. Two mutilations were reported in Kandiyohi County, six in Swift County, and one in Meeker County, Minnesota.</p>
<h3 id="1975-colorado">1975 Colorado <a href="#1975-colorado" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In 1975, the Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&rsquo;s top story. Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI for help due to public concern, claiming 130 mutilations in Colorado and reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report indicated an estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing approximately $1 million in damages. Donald E. Flickinger of the Michigan ATF investigated possible links to a &ldquo;Hell-oriented biker gang.&rdquo; The Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. The New York Times published a story examining cattle mutilations across 11 states.</p>
<h3 id="1976-dulce-new-mexico">1976 Dulce, New Mexico <a href="#1976-dulce-new-mexico" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>On June 13, 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.</p>
<h3 id="1979-public-meeting">1979 Public Meeting <a href="#1979-public-meeting" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. Paul Bennewitz reported seeing unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. On May 2, 1979, Valdez reported that two drugs had been found in the remains of a mutilated bull, one to tranquilize the animal and another to remove blood. On June 14, 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with radar chaff nearby.</p>
<h2 id="later-incidents">Later Incidents <a href="#later-incidents" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since 1967, chiefly in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002.</p>
<p>In 1993, photographic evidence surfaced of a mutilated male human corpse found near the Guarapiranga reservoir of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 1988.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics <a href="#characteristics" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Unusual cattle deaths are characterized by the absence of sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, rectum, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts are described as &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and &ldquo;surgical.&rdquo; Some animals are reported to have been drained of blood with no sign of blood in the immediate area. Howard Burgess stated that nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. Strange marks or imprints near the site have been found.</p>
<h3 id="laboratory-reports">Laboratory Reports <a href="#laboratory-reports" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Laboratory reports on some mutilated animals have shown unusual levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. In one case in Dulce, New Mexico, a bull was found mutilated with the rectum and sex organs removed. The animal&rsquo;s heart and liver were found to be inconsistent with a normal case of death followed by predation. The liver was found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain 4 times the normal level of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Blood samples were reported to be &ldquo;light pink in color&rdquo; and &ldquo;Did not clot after several days.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="helicopter-sightings">Helicopter Sightings <a href="#helicopter-sightings" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters were reported to have opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. in Honey Creek, Iowa. On August 20, 1974, the <em>Lincoln Journal Star</em> reported that residents had seen unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted several men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft resembling a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilation.</p>
<h2 id="official-investigations">Official Investigations <a href="#official-investigations" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The New Mexico Livestock Board sought assistance from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents went undercover to investigate. Oklahoma convened a task force. Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation.</p>
<h3 id="bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms <a href="#bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In January 1975, the Minnesota field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) launched an investigation, headed by Agent Donald Flickinger, into possible connections between cults and cattle mutilation. Flickinger recorded unusual incidents and circumstantial evidence but was unable to find sufficient evidence of cult involvement.</p>
<h3 id="colorado-bureau-of-investigation">Colorado Bureau of Investigation <a href="#colorado-bureau-of-investigation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under the leadership of Carl Whiteside. 19 animals underwent necropsies at Colorado State University but no conclusive results emerged. The US Bureau of Land Management was forced to ground all helicopters in Eastern Colorado. By December, the CBI had investigated 203 reports of cattle mutilations.</p>
<h3 id="new-mexico-state-police">New Mexico State Police <a href="#new-mexico-state-police" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>On June 13, 1976, the New Mexico State Police began an investigation, headed by Officer Gabe Valdez, with the assistance of Cattle Inspector Jim Dyad and Officer Howard Johnston of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish. On the night of July 5, Burgess and Valdez screened the Gomez herd; five animals were found to have been marked with a chemical that fluoresced under ultraviolet light. On June 14, 1981, intact radar chaff was found near a mutilated cow on the Gomez ranch. This investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant prior to their mutilation.</p>
<h3 id="rommel-investigation">Rommel Investigation <a href="#rommel-investigation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Beginning in May 1979, an investigation was funded by a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and was headed by recently-retired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel. Rommel&rsquo;s final report, released in June 1980, concluded that the mutilations were predominantly the result of natural</p>
