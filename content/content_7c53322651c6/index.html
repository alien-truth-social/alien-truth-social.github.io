Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that may have once been similar to Earth. The possibility of microbial life in Venus&rsquo;s high-altitude clouds is mentioned. Mars is described as a cold, airless desert, but its past abundance of water is noted, raising the possibility of past or present life. The gas giants and ice giants are considered unlikely to harbor life, but the potential for life on moons orbiting these planets is explored. Europa&rsquo;s subsurface ocean is highlighted, along with the subsurface oceans of Ganymede and Callisto. Enceladus&rsquo;s eruption columns, which release water into space, are discussed, along with the detection of complex organic molecules, salts, hydrogen, and methane by the Cassini probe. Titan, with its liquid hydrocarbon bodies and subsurface water ocean, is also considered, but its cold temperatures are noted as a limiting factor.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-search">Scientific Search <a href="#scientific-search" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2>
<p>This section introduces astrobiology as the science that searches for and studies life in the universe. It describes how astrobiology seeks to understand the origin, evolution, and requirements for the continuous existence of life, using the combined perspectives of various scientific disciplines. The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. The number of identified exoplanets is mentioned, along with the potential for other planets and moons in the Solar System to host primitive life. The section also mentions the reported status of studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus and Mars.</p>
