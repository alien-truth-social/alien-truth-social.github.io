&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise &lt;a href=&#34;#premise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alien crash-lands on Earth near a small town in Colorado. To blend in, it kills a vacationing physician named Harry Vanderspeigle and assumes his identity. The alien is tasked with performing an autopsy on the town&amp;rsquo;s deceased doctor and subsequently takes over his practice. The narrative explores the alien&amp;rsquo;s internal conflict regarding its mission to wipe out humanity, complicated by developing compassion and moral dilemmas. A key plot point involves the mayor&amp;rsquo;s son, Max, who can see through the alien&amp;rsquo;s disguise. As the series progresses, the alien must defend humanity from other extraterrestrial threats.&lt;/p&gt;

The season follows the alien&amp;rsquo;s initial crash landing, assumption of Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle&amp;rsquo;s identity, and struggle to blend in while pursuing its mission. Key events include the discovery of the real Harry&amp;rsquo;s foot in the lake, the introduction of Max Hawthorne who can see the alien&amp;rsquo;s true form, and the arrival of the real Harry&amp;rsquo;s wife, Isabelle.

The season explores Harry&amp;rsquo;s attempts to prevent an alien invasion, his journey to New York, and the emergence of Goliath, his future self. Key events include Harry losing his memory, Asta discovering she has a daughter, and the introduction of new characters like Carlyn and Violinda Darvell. The season ends with Harry learning about Grey-human hybrids and the abduction of Ben Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;season-3-2024&#34;&gt;Season 3 (2024) &lt;a href=&#34;#season-3-2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third season consists of 8 episodes. Harry works with General McCallister to eliminate the Grey Alien threat. Asta and Harry work together to undermine Joseph, a Grey-human hybrid. Ben and Kate experience troubling visions related to their abductions. Harry has a romantic relationship with a Blue Avian alien named Heather. The season culminates with Harry&amp;rsquo;s bomb going missing, D&amp;rsquo;arcy taking the bomb to the Greys&amp;rsquo; base, and the revelation that the Greys&amp;rsquo; mother ship is actually Earth&amp;rsquo;s Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien abduction entities</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction-entities&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction Entities &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction-entities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia entry focuses on the beings alleged to be responsible for alien abductions, particularly those involving forced medical examinations with an emphasis on the reproductive system. It highlights the skepticism surrounding the phenomenon within the scientific and mental health communities, attributing such experiences to psychological and environmental factors rather than literal events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alleged-motivations&#34;&gt;Alleged Motivations &lt;a href=&#34;#alleged-motivations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the purported reasons behind alien abductions, as claimed by experiencers. Dr. John G. Miller&amp;rsquo;s research indicates that abductees often report entities claiming a &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; to perform invasive procedures. UFOlogist Jenny Randles&amp;rsquo; study of 50 abduction claims reveals that in approximately 60% of cases, abductors provided insights into their motivations, often involving long-term surveillance and interaction. These motivations form a narrative centered on the entities targeting individuals with unique qualities for repeated abductions, during which information is subconsciously implanted for later activation, potentially coinciding with major Earth changes. Different entity types, such as &amp;ldquo;Nordics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Grays,&amp;rdquo; are said to have varying motivations, with Nordics being perceived as more benevolent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types&#34;&gt;Types &lt;a href=&#34;#types&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section categorizes the different types of entities reported in alien abduction claims. It presents two tables summarizing these types based on different studies. The first table, based on a survey of 203 pre-1985 abduction claims, lists entities such as Short Humanoids (including short grey aliens), Average Height Humanoids (including tall grey aliens), Tall Humanoids, Mummy-like beings, Miscellaneous Humanoids (including reptoids and hairy dwarves), Human-like beings (including Nordics), and Non-human entities. The second table, based on Claudier Covo&amp;rsquo;s Brazilian Alien Typology from a study of 138 alleged abductions, categorizes entities as Alpha (0.8â€“1.4 m tall), Beta (1.4â€“2 m tall), Gamma (over 2 m tall), Delta (animals, robots, etc.), Omega (energy beings), and Sigma (very short beings about 0.15 m tall). The section also mentions &amp;ldquo;Mantid aliens&amp;rdquo; as frequently reported by abductees, often described as being in charge of the grays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reported-technology&#34;&gt;Reported Technology &lt;a href=&#34;#reported-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the technological capabilities allegedly displayed by alien abduction entities. Claimants report being levitated, flown around, and witnessing entities passing through walls. Further claimed technical capabilities have been described â€“ including in various books by ufologists â€“ generally without any detailed hypotheses regarding how such appearances or actual capabilities may or may not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;weapon&#34;&gt;Weapon &lt;a href=&#34;#weapon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on a specific weapon allegedly used by grey aliens, as described in Nick Pope&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;The Uninvited&lt;/em&gt;. The device is described as a black, cylindrical object, similar in size to a pencil, with a bluish light on one end. It is reportedly used to subdue combative abductees by numbing their will, resembling a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;phaser&amp;rdquo; firing a bluish-white beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;medical&#34;&gt;Medical &lt;a href=&#34;#medical&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection describes a medical device reported by Linda Moulton Howe, based on independent reports from at least two alleged abductions. The device is a pencil-sized cylinder with a light on one end, used in a manner analogous to a surgical scalpel. One abductee described the device opening the chest bloodlessly in &amp;ldquo;slow motion,&amp;rdquo; comparing it to a flower blossoming in time-lapse photography, and described the device as &amp;ldquo;opening the body with sound.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plausibility-and-veracity&#34;&gt;Plausibility and Veracity &lt;a href=&#34;#plausibility-and-veracity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section addresses the plausibility and veracity of alien abduction claims, particularly focusing on the influence of hypnosis, geography, culture, and science fiction on abductor descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hypnosis-as-an-influence-on-abductor-descriptions&#34;&gt;Hypnosis as an Influence on Abductor Descriptions &lt;a href=&#34;#hypnosis-as-an-influence-on-abductor-descriptions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection examines the impact of hypnosis on the descriptions of abducting beings. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard notes that the absence of monstrous types in reliable cases contradicts the idea that Hollywood influences abduction reports. He also observes that hypnotically assisted recall tends to produce descriptions of &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; Grey humanoids, while cases without hypnosis include more variety. Bullard raises the question of whether hypnosis shapes memories or reveals the true appearance of the beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geography-and-culture-as-influences-on-abductor-descriptions&#34;&gt;Geography and Culture as Influences on Abductor Descriptions &lt;a href=&#34;#geography-and-culture-as-influences-on-abductor-descriptions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores how geographic and cultural factors influence the details of abduction reports. Robert Sheaffer observes that in North America, large-headed gray aliens are predominant, while in Britain, abduction aliens are usually tall, blond, and Nordic, and South America tends toward more bizarre creatures. The section also notes that common elements in abduction descriptions vary by region and local culture, with only a few elements being consistent worldwide, such as otherworldly sensations, mind control, repressed memories, and sexual experiences, which are also common in stories of encounters with faeries, demons, and other magical creatures. In Brazil, there are strong links between the abduction phenomenon and spiritist traditions, with claims of medical practitioners operating out of a space laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;science-fiction-as-an-influence&#34;&gt;Science Fiction as an Influence &lt;a href=&#34;#science-fiction-as-an-influence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the potential influence of science fiction on abduction reports. Sheaffer notes similarities between aliens depicted in early science fiction films, such as &lt;em&gt;Invaders From Mars&lt;/em&gt;, and those reported to have abducted people. Commonalities exist in the appearances, behavior, technology, and societies of fictional and allegedly real abductors. The &amp;ldquo;abduction narrative&amp;rdquo; was already established in fictional form by 1930 in a Buck Rogers comic strip. However, Bullard does not see evidence for influence on abduction claimants from science fiction sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;area-51&#34;&gt;Area 51 &lt;a href=&#34;#area-51&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&amp;rsquo;s a remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&amp;rsquo;s widely believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it a central subject of conspiracy theories and UFO folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&amp;rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with roads leading to Mercury and Yucca Flat. Groom Lake Road runs northeast through the Jumbled Hills, past a security checkpoint, and eventually connects with State Route 375, the &amp;ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&amp;rdquo; south of Rachel, Nevada. Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, the location of many nuclear tests. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is southwest of Groom Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;groom-lake&#34;&gt;Groom Lake &lt;a href=&#34;#groom-lake&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groom Lake is a salt flat in Nevada used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (XTA/KXTA) on the north of the Area 51 USAF military installation. It&amp;rsquo;s located within the Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, south of Rachel, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the name &amp;ldquo;Area 51&amp;rdquo; is unclear. The facility is also referred to as Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake. Other nicknames include &amp;ldquo;Dreamland&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; The special use airspace around the field is referred to as Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N). Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864, leading to mining operations until the early 1950s. The airfield began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;u-2-program&#34;&gt;U-2 program &lt;a href=&#34;#u-2-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE: the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Project director Richard M. Bissell Jr. sought a secure testing site. Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s Kelly Johnson identified Groom Lake as ideal. The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated &amp;ldquo;Area 51.&amp;rdquo; Johnson named the area &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; The Ranch initially consisted of shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. CIA, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began arriving by July 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;oxcart-program&#34;&gt;OXCART program &lt;a href=&#34;#oxcart-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project OXCART was established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12. Construction of A-12 test facilities began in September 1960, including a new runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) upgraded base facilities. The contractor marked an Archimedean spiral on the dry lake. Security was enhanced, and the FAA expanded the restricted airspace. The CIA facility received various USAF aircraft for training and support. The first A-12 test aircraft arrived in February 1962 and made its first flight in April 1962. Groom was also the site of the first Lockheed D-21 drone test flight in December 1964. By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA-operated &amp;ldquo;1129th Special Activities Squadron.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;d-21-tagboard&#34;&gt;D-21 Tagboard &lt;a href=&#34;#d-21-tagboard&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of Gary Powers&amp;rsquo; U-2, there were discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. The Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The project designated &amp;ldquo;Q-12&amp;rdquo; was renamed the &amp;ldquo;D-21&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Tagboard&amp;rdquo; was the project&amp;rsquo;s code name. The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the &amp;ldquo;M-21&amp;rdquo;. Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21 caused it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber. Several more tests, including two over China, were made from Beale AFB, California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreign-technology-evaluation&#34;&gt;Foreign technology evaluation &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-technology-evaluation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the United States tested and evaluated captured Soviet fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, Area 51 hosted Soviet-built aircraft. Munir Redfa&amp;rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 from Iraq for Israel&amp;rsquo;s Mossad in Operation Diamond led to the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters. In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in late 1967 for study. In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy&amp;rsquo;s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet-made aircraft in simulated air combat training. On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of MiG-17Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel. Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed, which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects, and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport. Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. In 2017, a USAF aircraft crashed at the site, killing the pilot, Lt. Colonel Eric &amp;ldquo;Doc&amp;rdquo; Schultz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-bluef-117-program&#34;&gt;Have Blue/F-117 program &lt;a href=&#34;#have-bluef-117-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter first flew at Groom in December 1977. In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full-scale development (FSD) prototype 79â€“780, designated YF-117A. On 18 June 1981 Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A 79â€“780 off the runway of Area 51. Tactical Air Command (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group, which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at Nellis AFB, Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. On 15 October 1982, Major Alton C. Whitley Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A. Tonopah Test Range Airport was selected for operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the 4450th Tactical Group (TG). By early 1982, four more YF-117As were operating at the base. Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Area 51 until mid-1981 when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Area 51 by C-5 during darkness to maintain security. While the &amp;ldquo;Baja Scorpions&amp;rdquo; were working on the F-117, there was also another group at work&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. Those who claim to have been abducted are referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; The prevailing scientific and mental health perspective attributes these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology. Skeptics note similarities between alien descriptions and those in science fiction films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally dismiss claims of literal alien abduction. However, some researchers, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that many abductees are sane individuals. A subculture has developed around the phenomenon, complete with support groups and a detailed mythos involving various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics) with specific roles and motivations. Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses older stories that some UFO researchers, like Jerome Clark, have interpreted as possible early cases of alien abduction, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions.&amp;rdquo; Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A November 27, 1896, report in &lt;em&gt;The Evening Mail&lt;/em&gt; of Stockton, California, where Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1953 &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; article by Leroy Thorpe, questioning if humans were being captured by flying saucers for experimentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s 1955 publication &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt;, which reported the mysterious disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who had claimed contact with aliens, suggesting they might have been abducted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section highlights two early alien abduction claims that gained significant attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The AntÃ´nio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil in the mid-1950s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961, which received widespread publicity and was dramatized in a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, introducing the beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identifying an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptic Peter Rogerson notes that these cases established a template for later abduction reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the evolution of the alien abduction phenomenon and the involvement of key figures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in abductions in the 1960s and linked them to cattle mutilation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budd Hopkins, an artist interested in UFOs, began using hypnosis in the 1970s to uncover details of abduction experiences, becoming a figurehead in the abductee subculture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1980s saw increased mainstream attention, with works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack presenting alien abduction as a plausible experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas E. Bullard&amp;rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published in the 1980s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than previously suspected and that aliens were attempting to create human-alien hybrids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Linda Rodriguez McRobbie of the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media in recent decades. Michael Shermer suggests that camera phones have increased the burden of evidence for such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack, who believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, criticized Mack for uncritically elaborating on abduction tales and potentially creating false memories. Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject, but his professional reputation suffered as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the demographics and mental health of alleged abductees. The precise number of abductees is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 1,700 claimants in early studies to 5â€“6 percent of the general population in contested surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports are usually made by adults, but sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental Health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &amp;ldquo;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&amp;rdquo;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking&amp;rdquo;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &amp;ldquo;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the connections between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, and government cover-ups. Political scientist Michael Barkun highlights the rise of &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism&amp;rdquo; and the role of UFO and abduction stories in stigmatized knowledge narratives. He notes the emergence of alien-related conspiracy theories in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards. TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; are mentioned as examples of popular culture incorporating alien conspiracies. Jodi Dean notes that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities. Self-described abduction victims may join self-help communities and espouse conspiracy theories involving mind control and a New World Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the common elements and sequence of events reported in abduction narratives. According to CUFOS&amp;rsquo;s definition of &lt;em&gt;abductee&lt;/em&gt;, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; through means like hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas E. Bullard argues that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind.&amp;rdquo; These events include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures:&lt;/strong&gt; Invasive physiological and psychological procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference:&lt;/strong&gt; Communication with the abductors, typically telepathically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour:&lt;/strong&gt; A tour of the captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Rapid forgetting of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; Return to Earth, sometimes in a different location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany:&lt;/strong&gt; A profound sense of love or a mystical experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath:&lt;/strong&gt; Coping with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs emphasizes the orchestrated nature of the abduction event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet. Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, in the latter case often through solid objects such as walls, ceilings or a closed window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations performed by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. These procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. John G. Miller notes differences between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subsequent-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, abductees often report other procedures, including imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; involves viewing screens displaying emotionally provocative images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; involves images projected into the experiencer&amp;rsquo;s mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Staging&amp;rdquo; involves the abductee interacting with an illusionary scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Testing&amp;rdquo; involves operating a complicated electronic device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;child-presentation&#34;&gt;Child Presentation &lt;a href=&#34;#child-presentation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abductees sometimes report being shown a &amp;ldquo;child&amp;rdquo; who appears to be a hybrid between humans and their abductors. Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;less-common-elements&#34;&gt;Less Common Elements &lt;a href=&#34;#less-common-elements&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullard&amp;rsquo;s study of 300 abduction reports also identified less prominent aspects of the claims, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The journey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theophany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These episodes tend to happen between the medical examination and the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;return&#34;&gt;Return &lt;a href=&#34;#return&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-autopsy-1995-television-film&#34;&gt;Alien Autopsy (1995 television film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy-1995-television-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the 1995 pseudo-documentary &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which featured footage purporting to show an alien autopsy conducted after the Roswell incident. The article distinguishes this footage from the 2006 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt;, which is a fictionalized account of the events surrounding the creation and release of the footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the production of the hoaxed alien autopsy footage. In 2006, Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield admitted to creating the 1995 footage. They filmed a simulated autopsy on a fabricated alien in a set constructed in a London living room. Artist and sculptor John Humphreys constructed two dummy alien bodies filled with raspberry jam, sheep brains, and chicken entrails. Humphreys also played the role of the chief examiner. Alien artifacts were also created by Humphreys. Santilli and Shoefield also admitted to finding a homeless man in Los Angeles and paying him to play the role of the cameraman.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cattle-mutilation&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilation &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle (and other animals) under unusual and often bloodless circumstances. The phenomenon is often linked to paranormal or supernatural explanations, including cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. Mutilations typically involve the removal of specific body parts such as ears, eyeballs, jaw flesh, tongues, lymph nodes, genitals, and rectums. Two independent federal investigations have been conducted in the United States to examine these incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;early-history&#34;&gt;Early History &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest documented cases of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in England in 1606. Whole slaughters of sheep were reported, with only tallow and some inward parts taken. Charles Fort collected accounts of cattle mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; Horse Death of 1967 &lt;a href=&#34;#the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexplained livestock deaths gained wider attention in 1967 with the case of &amp;ldquo;Snippy,&amp;rdquo; a horse found mutilated in Alamosa, Colorado. The Pueblo Chieftain published a story about the incident, noting the horse&amp;rsquo;s head and neck had been skinned and defleshed with precise cuts, and there was no blood at the scene. This case was the first to link extraterrestrial beings and UFOs to mutilations. Wadsworth Ayer investigated the case for the Condon Committee and concluded there was no evidence to support the assertion that the horse&amp;rsquo;s death was associated with abnormal causes. Alamosa County Sheriff Ben Phillips suggested a lightning strike as the cause. Later press coverage mentioned the horse had been shot. Two students from Alamosa State College confessed to shooting the horse several weeks after the case was publicized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilations 1973â€“1980 &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waves of cattle mutilations were reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico during this period. In April 1973, sheriffs in Western Iowa reported unidentified helicopters involved in cattle and pig rustling. Similar rustling was reported in Missouri in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1973-kansas-wave&#34;&gt;1973 Kansas Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1973-kansas-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about a caller posing as a USDA official conducting a survey of herd population and locations. A series of butchered cows were found on farms near Munden, Kansas. The right ear was often removed. Local press speculated about a &amp;lsquo;Mad Dog&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;phantom&amp;rsquo; Butcher. By December, law enforcement reported investigating 40 mutilations across Kansas and Nebraska. State Senator Ross Doyen reported a cattle mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&amp;rsquo;s office determined that most of the deaths and removal of sex organs were the result of natural causes including predation, &amp;ldquo;[shipping fever](Shipping fever)&amp;rdquo; and [blackleg](Blackleg_(disease). Modlin disagreed with these conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1974-nebraska-wave&#34;&gt;1974 Nebraska Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1974-nebraska-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports resumed in April 1974, when a Nebraska cow was discovered mutilated and drained of blood. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations along with sightings of unidentified helicopters. In May, two mutilations were reported in Mills County, Iowa. By June 1974, mutilations were reported in Lancaster County, Nebraska. Custer Country reported similar helicopter sightings and armed patrols. On August 14, 1974, the Cascade County, Montana Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Office received its first report of a mutilated cow. An unidentified helicopter was spotted hovering 400 feet above where a mutilated cow would later be discovered near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported that armed civilians had begun patrols in response to repeated helicopter sightings. Cloud County Attorney William Walsh told press of a jailhouse informant who claimed to be a former cult member and opined the mutilations were likely the result of devil-worshiping cultists. State Sen. John Decamp called on authorities to coordinate an investigation into the mutilations. A rancher near Hartington apparently thwarted a mutilation in progress when he found a helicopter above his field. Authorities cautioned the public not to shoot at aircraft. Over 50 law enforcement officials from 24 counties attended a meeting at the Knox County Courthouse in Center, Nebraska to discuss the mutilations. South Dakota Attorney General Kermit Sande told press that a number of mutilations had been reported in the state. UFO expert J. Allen Hynek released a statement denying any link between UFOs and cattle mutilations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1975-colorado&#34;&gt;1975 Colorado &lt;a href=&#34;#1975-colorado&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&amp;rsquo;s top story. Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI asking for help due to public concern. He claimed there had been 130 mutilations in Colorado alone, and further reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report indicated that, according to investigations by the New Mexico State Police, there had been an estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing approximately $1 million in damages. In January 1975, the Michigan ATF tasked Donald E. Flickinger with investigating the mutilations. In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under the leadership of Carl Whiteside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34;&gt;1976 Dulce, New Mexico &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1979-public-meeting&#34;&gt;1979 Public Meeting &lt;a href=&#34;#1979-public-meeting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. Paul Bennewitz approached Valdez and reported having seen unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. On May 2, 1979, Valdez told press that two drugs had been found in the remains of a mutilated bull found in Torrance County on February 15. On June 14, 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with a large amount of radar chaff nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;later-incidents&#34;&gt;Later Incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#later-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since the 1967 Snippy incident, chiefly in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002. In 1993, photographic evidence surfaced of a mutilated male human corpse that was found near the Guarapiranga reservoir of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle death due to natural causes are extremely common. Unusual cattle deaths are characterized by absence of sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, rectum, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts were described as &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;surgical&amp;rdquo;. Some animals were reported to have been drained of blood but with no sign of blood in the immediate area or even around their wounds. According to Howard Burgess, nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. In some cases, strange marks or imprints near the site have been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;laboratory-reports&#34;&gt;Laboratory Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#laboratory-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory reports carried out on some mutilated animals have shown unusually high or low levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples, and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. In one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI, an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to a Mr. Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, was found mutilated on March 24, 1978. Los Alamos detected the presence of naturally occurring &lt;em&gt;Clostridium&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in the heart. Samples from the animal&amp;rsquo;s liver were found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain 4 times the normal level of zinc, potassium and phosphorus. Blood samples taken at the scene were reported to be &amp;ldquo;light pink in color&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Did not clot after several days&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;helicopter-sightings&#34;&gt;Helicopter Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#helicopter-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters were reported to have opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. while he was driving his tractor on his farm in Honey Creek, Iowa. On August 20, 1974, the &lt;em&gt;Lincoln Journal Star&lt;/em&gt; reported that residents had seen unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups to patrol their fields at night. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted several men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter at a small community airport in Cache County. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft which resembled a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilation which claimed 16 cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;official-investigations&#34;&gt;Official Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#official-investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Mexico Livestock Board sought assistance from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents went undercover to investigate. Oklahoma convened a task force. Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34;&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms &lt;a href=&#34;#bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1975, the Minnesota field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) launched their own investigation into the phenomenon, headed by Agent Donald Flickinger. Flickinger was tasked with investigating the possible connections between cults and the mutilation of cattle. Flickinger recorded a number of &amp;ldquo;unusual&amp;rdquo; incidents and circumstantial evidence, but was unable to find sufficient evidence of cult involvement for the ATF to take further action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34;&gt;Colorado Bureau of Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 197&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia entry delves into the world of UFO conspiracy theories, exploring the belief that governments, particularly the United States government, are suppressing evidence of extraterrestrial life and technology. It examines the historical development of these theories, their proponents, and their presence in popular culture and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the core concept of UFO conspiracy theories: the alleged suppression of evidence regarding extraterrestrial-controlled UFOs or technology. It notes the evolution of these theories, from initial claims of government cover-ups to more complex narratives involving communication and cooperation with extraterrestrials, including claims of government allowance of cattle mutilation and alien abduction. It also mentions the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&amp;rsquo;s stance that there is little to no evidence supporting these theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mainstream-views&#34;&gt;Mainstream Views &lt;a href=&#34;#mainstream-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents the mainstream scientific perspective on UFOs. It acknowledges the historical and cultural prominence of UFO sightings, particularly after World War II and during the Space Age. It highlights government and independent investigations that have failed to confirm extraordinary claims made by ufologists. Prosaic explanations for UFO sightings, such as natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes, are offered. The section also touches upon the psychosocial explanations for UFO beliefs and their influence on new religions. Benjamin Radford&amp;rsquo;s argument about the unlikelihood of a decades-long, international cover-up is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-proponents&#34;&gt;Notable Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section identifies key figures associated with UFO conspiracy theories. Donald Keyhoe, Jacque Vallee, J. Allen Hynek, and Stanton Friedman are mentioned as prominent voices from the 1950s to the 1970s. It also notes that some early proponents, like Richard Shaver and Paul Bennewitz, suffered from psychiatric issues, and that some proponents confessed to hoaxes or lies. The section lists individuals in positions of authority, such as Senator Barry Goldwater, Admiral Lord Hill-Norton, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, and astronauts Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell, who have suggested that UFO evidence is being suppressed. 21st-century proponents like Paul Hellyer, Garry Nolan, Haim Eshed, Jim Semivan, Harold E. Puthoff, Tom DeLonge, Luis Elizondo, and David Grusch are also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-fiction&#34;&gt;In Popular Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the portrayal of government cover-ups of extraterrestrial contact in popular fiction. Films like &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Easy Rider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Flight of the Navigator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt; are cited as examples. Television series such as &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt; are also mentioned. The section also notes John Glenn&amp;rsquo;s appearance on &lt;em&gt;Frasier&lt;/em&gt;, Sidney Sheldon&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;The Doomsday Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;, and the series &lt;em&gt;American Horror Story: Double Feature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-religion&#34;&gt;In Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#in-religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines the intersection of UFO conspiracy theories and religion. It identifies new religious movements, including the Nation of Islam, Scientology, and Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate, that have incorporated UFO-related beliefs. Mormon cosmology, Theosophy, and the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; Activity are also discussed. The section mentions the Nation of Islam&amp;rsquo;s concept of &amp;ldquo;The Mother Plane,&amp;rdquo; the UFO religions Unarius and the Aetherius Society, L. Ron Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s teachings about Xenu in Scientology, and the RaÃ«lism movement. It concludes with the Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate mass suicide and the Order of the Solar Temple mass deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology-of-ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Chronology of UFO Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology-of-ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides a detailed timeline of the development of UFO conspiracy theories, starting with Raymond Palmer&amp;rsquo;s pulp magazine &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&lt;/em&gt; in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the Grey alien image. These beings have become an archetypal representation of intelligent non-human creatures and extraterrestrial life in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are generally described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin and reduced or absent external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. They have disproportionately large heads, no hair, and small openings for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their most striking feature is their large, opaque, black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection elaborates on the physical appearance of Greys. They are typically depicted as grey-skinned, small humanoids with reduced or absent external human body parts. Their bodies are elongated, with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from humans. They have unusually large heads in proportion to their bodies, no hair, and no noticeable outer ears or noses. They are almost always shown with very large, opaque, black eyes, without eye whites, and are frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains the connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system. The association originated with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed to have been shown a map displaying the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system and nearby stars. Fish created a model from Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and determined that the stars marked as the aliens&amp;rsquo; home were Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype. Descriptions of beings similar to Greys predate claims of encounters with them. H.G. Wells described humans with similar features in his writings from the late 19th century. Aleister Crowley described a meeting with a similar entity named Lam as early as 1917. Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, described similar aliens in his 1933 science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the literary and occult origins of the Grey alien archetype. In 1893, H.G. Wells described humanity&amp;rsquo;s future appearance as lacking mouths, noses, or hair, and with large heads. In 1895, Wells depicted the Eloi in similar terms in &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. As early as 1917, Aleister Crowley described a meeting with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, similar in appearance to a modern Grey. In 1933, Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, published &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;, describing extraterrestrials with grey fabric clothes, short stature, big bald heads, and large, dark, gleaming eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case and its role in popularizing the Grey alien archetype. Newspaper reports of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1965 made the archetype famous. The Hills claimed that in 1961, grey-skinned humanoid alien beings abducted them and took them to a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield.&amp;rdquo; Carl Sagan echoed Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s suspicions, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses how Greys became an integral part of ufology and extraterrestrial-related folklore after the Hills&amp;rsquo; encounter. According to journalist C.D.B. Bryan, 73% of all reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. In the early 1980s, Greys were linked to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published the book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, describing his alleged close encounters with Greys and other extraterrestrial beings. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu described &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; on French television. In 1995, Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage depicting the autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection examines the role of Greys in alien abduction claims and ufology. Greys are often involved in alien abduction claims, making up about 50% of reports in Australia, 73% in the United States, 48% in continental Europe, and around 12% in the United Kingdom. These reports include two distinct groups of Greys that differ in height. Abduction claims are often described as extremely traumatic. The eyes are often a focus of abduction claims, with Greys staring into the eyes of abductees when conducting mental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents neurologist Steven Novella&amp;rsquo;s theory that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with their distinctive features representing everything that modern humans traditionally link with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection introduces Frederick V. Malmstrom&amp;rsquo;s idea that Greys are actually residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom reconstructs the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face based on our best understanding of early-childhood sensation and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s argument that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be credible as a representation of an alien from a world with different environmental and ecological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection mentions alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of alleged Grey aliens, including the interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the prevalence of Grey aliens in popular culture. Depictions of Grey aliens have appeared in numerous films and television shows, supplanting the previously popular little green men. Examples include Ultraman, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Babylon 5, Stargate, and South Park. During the 1990s, plotlines wherein Greys were linked to conspiracy theories became common, such as in The X-Files. Other examples include the XCOM video game franchise, Dark Skies, and American Dad!. The 2011 film Paul tells the story of a Grey named Paul who attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; frequent presence in science fiction pop culture to the US government deliberately inserting the stereotypical Grey alien image into mainstream media. Child abduction by Greys is a key plot point in the 2013 film, Dark Skies. Greys appear in Syfy&amp;rsquo;s 2021 science fiction dramedy series Resident Alien. The Greys appear as the main antagonistic faction in the 2023 independent game Greyhill Incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nordic-aliens&#34;&gt;Nordic Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#nordic-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ufology, &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites&amp;rdquo; are terms used to describe alleged humanoid extraterrestrial races from the Pleiades star cluster. These beings are said to resemble Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans, with features like tall stature (6-7 ft), blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some reports describe their skin tone as pale blue/grey or pastel purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural historian David J. Skal suggests that early stories of Nordic aliens may have been inspired by the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;. Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; noting that believers often associate Nordic aliens with spiritual growth and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ufology, Nordic aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1950s, many people, especially in Europe, claimed encounters with these beings. However, such claims became less common in later decades as the grey alien became more prevalent in extraterrestrial encounter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An eyewitness at a family BBQ were enjoying the day when someone pointed out a white orb in the sky above. Then others came and they noticed it stayed over them as if it were watching them and recording the humans reactions to what they were seeing. You see, aliens love knowledge, like humans like money, knowledge is everything to them. The smaller orb drones are sent out from a mother drone and months later gathered after the orbs have recorded information about anything and everything they saw.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-hive&#34;&gt;Alien Hive &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-hive&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Hive&lt;/em&gt; is a puzzle video game developed and published by Malaysia-based studio Appxplore. It was released in March 2013 for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone platforms. The game combines match-three and sliding puzzle mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gameplay&#34;&gt;Gameplay &lt;a href=&#34;#gameplay&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core gameplay involves swiping tiles to match eggs and aliens, with the goal of hatching, breeding, and evolving them into the Supreme Alien. Players aim to build the ultimate alien hive by matching resource tiles. Players must avoid Naughty Bots and use power-ups to eliminate them, while also trying to minimize the number of moves used. As players progress, they encounter more aliens and uncover their mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Fruit, collected by merging seeds into saplings, is essential for evolving Supreme Aliens. These fruits allow players to merge similar-level items using only two of a kind instead of three. Evolved Supreme Aliens can be activated using gold to provide special bonuses in future games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-app-purchase&#34;&gt;In App Purchase &lt;a href=&#34;#in-app-purchase&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Hive&lt;/em&gt; incorporates microtransactions, where players can exchange real money for in-game gold to purchase consumable items. This aspect of the game has faced criticism, with some reviewers suggesting that microtransactions are almost necessary to progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Hive&lt;/em&gt; received an average score of 70 out of 100 based on reviews aggregated by Metacritic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2015, the game had achieved over 3 million downloads across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no such life has been conclusively detected, it could range from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The study of extraterrestrial life falls under the domain of astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides a framework for understanding the conditions necessary for life in the universe. It begins with the Big Bang and the early universe, highlighting the initial extreme temperatures and the subsequent formation of elements like carbon and oxygen through stellar fusion. The emergence of planetary systems and organic compounds in protoplanetary disks is discussed, leading to the possibility of abiogenesis on planets like Earth. The concept of panspermia, the spread of life between habitable planets, is also introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context extends to Earth&amp;rsquo;s place in the Solar System, the Milky Way galaxy, and the larger universe, emphasizing the vast distances that pose challenges to studying extraterrestrial life. The limitations of current technology, such as probes and telescopes, are acknowledged. The circumstellar habitable zone, or &amp;ldquo;Goldilocks zone,&amp;rdquo; is explained as an area around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet&amp;rsquo;s surface, but it&amp;rsquo;s noted that habitability is complex and depends on various factors. The section concludes by considering the age of the universe and the possibility that life on other planets may have emerged and become extinct long ago. Avi Loeb&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe&amp;rdquo; is mentioned, suggesting a period shortly after the Big Bang when conditions might have been suitable for primitive life. The adaptability of life on Earth, even in extreme environments, is highlighted, but it&amp;rsquo;s also noted that habitability does not guarantee the presence of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the debate over whether life in the cosmos is common or rare. The hypothesis of ubiquitous extraterrestrial life rests on the size and age of the universe, the ubiquity of life&amp;rsquo;s chemical elements, and the universality of physical laws. Scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view, which is embodied in the Copernican and mediocrity principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rare Earth hypothesis, which posits that life on Earth is possible due to a unique combination of factors, is presented as an opposing viewpoint. The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation&amp;rsquo;s variables, such as the rate of star formation and the fraction of planets that support life, are explained. The Drake equation is controversial because many of its values are speculative. The section concludes by discussing the Fermi paradox, the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for their existence. Dennis W. Sciama, Zhi-Wei Wang, and Samuel L. Braunstein&amp;rsquo;s contributions to the Fermi Paradox are mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the potential forms and requirements of extraterrestrial life. It considers a range of possibilities, from simple microorganisms to complex alien intelligences. The basic requirements for life, such as non-equilibrium thermodynamics and a source of energy, are outlined. Stars, volcanoes, plate tectonics, and hydrothermal vents are mentioned as potential energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of liquid water as a solvent for biochemical reactions is emphasized, but alternatives like ammonia and liquid hydrocarbons are also considered. The section explores the chemical elements that could compose extraterrestrial life, focusing on carbon and potential replacements like silicon. The advantages and disadvantages of silicon-based life are discussed. Norman Horowitz&amp;rsquo;s view on the versatility of carbon is noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also considers the potential for radically different biochemistries, even if life is based on carbon and water. The requirements for natural selection, such as replication, damage avoidance, and resource acquisition, are outlined. The evolution from simple cells to eukaryotes and multicellular organisms is discussed, along with the possibility of convergent evolution leading to similar lifeforms on other planets. Simon Conway Morris&amp;rsquo;s ideas on convergent evolution are mentioned. Research assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence is also noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34;&gt;Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life &lt;a href=&#34;#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section addresses the common perception that the harsh conditions on other planets make them unlikely to harbor life. It presents evidence that some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section highlights the chemosynthetic processes that occur around hydrothermal vents, allowing organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon. These reactions enable organisms to live in low-oxygen environments. The early Earth environment was reducing, making these carbon-fixing compounds essential for survival. The section suggests that similar processes could occur on other planets with reducing atmospheres, potentially leading to the origin of extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34;&gt;Planetary Habitability in the Solar System &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines the potential for life on other bodies within our Solar System. Besides Earth, Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most likely candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that may have once been similar to Earth, but now has a runaway greenhouse effect and a thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere. The possibility of microbial life in high-altitude clouds is mentioned. Mars is described as a cold, airless desert, but with evidence of abundant water in the past, suggesting it may have been habitable. The loss of its magnetic field and atmosphere is noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gas giants and ice giants are considered unlikely to harbor life, but their moons are of interest. Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are mentioned as having subsurface oceans, with Europa being the most promising due to contact between its ocean and rocky surface. Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, is highlighted for its eruption columns that release water into space, containing complex organic molecules, salts, hydrogen, and methane. Titan, another moon of Saturn, is unique for having liquid bodies on its surface, composed of hydrocarbons, but its cold temperatures may limit chemical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-search&#34;&gt;Scientific Search &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-search&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the scientific methods used to search for extraterrestrial life. Astrobiology, the science that studies life in the universe, is introduced. It encompasses various scientific disciplines, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets is mentioned, along with the potential for primitive life on other planets and moons in the Solar System. Studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus (via phosphine) and Mars (via methane) are noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-basic-life&#34;&gt;Search for Basic Life &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-basic-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for biosignatures, indicators of life, within the Solar System and beyond. Scientists study planetary surfaces and examine meteorites for evidence of past or present life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversial report of nanobacteria-like structures in the ALH84001 meteorite, originating from Mars, is mentioned. The Viking Mars landers&amp;rsquo; gas emission experiments, which some scientists interpret as evidence of living microorganisms, are discussed. NASA&amp;rsquo;s Mars Science Laboratory and the Curiosity rover&amp;rsquo;s mission to assess past and present habitability on Mars are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a catalog of microorganisms and their reactions to sunlight is mentioned as a tool for identifying similar organisms on exoplanets. The discovery of nucleobases in meteorites found in Antarctica is noted, suggesting that organic molecules may be generated within asteroids and comets. The presence of complex organic compounds in cosmic dust is also mentioned. The detection of glycolaldehyde, a sugar molecule needed to form RNA, in a distant star system is highlighted. The discovery of hydrogen cyanide in the plumes of Enceladus is mentioned as a possible chemical essential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section shifts the focus to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). It discusses the possibility of detecting civilizations through technosignatures, effects on their native planet that may not be caused by natural causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interstellar communications, atmospheric effects, and planetary-sized structures like Dyson spheres are mentioned as potential technosignatures. Organizations like the SETI Institute search for radio waves and laser pulses. The challenges of distinguishing artificial signals from natural sources and the limitations of current telescopes are acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for detecting nitrogen dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and light pollution in exoplanet atmospheres is discussed. The Kardashev scale, which proposes that civilizations may eventually consume energy directly from their local star, is introduced. The possibility of detecting heavy elements in a star&amp;rsquo;s light spectrum as evidence of nuclear waste disposal is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extrasolar-planets&#34;&gt;Extrasolar Planets &lt;a href=&#34;#extrasolar-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for exoplanets that may be conducive to life. Astronomers focus on terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of thousands of exoplanets is mentioned, ranging in size from Earth-like to gas giants. The Kepler space telescope&amp;rsquo;s detection of thousands of candidate planets is highlighted. The estimate that there is at least one planet per star and that a significant fraction of Sun-like stars have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone is noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearest known exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, is mentioned. The least massive and most massive exoplanets known are identified. The study of planetary habitability considers a wide range of factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life. The presence of oxygen in a planet&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere is mentioned as a potential sign of life. The use of spectrography to analyze exoplanet atmospheres during transit is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-and-cultural-impact&#34;&gt;History and Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#history-and-cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical development of ideas about extraterrestrial life and its cultural influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosmic-pluralism&#34;&gt;Cosmic Pluralism &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-pluralism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the concept of&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;crop-circle&#34;&gt;Crop Circle &lt;a href=&#34;#crop-circle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crop circle, also known as a crop formation or corn circle, is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural causes or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two hoaxers, claimed responsibility for creating over 200 crop circles throughout England. Reported circles in the United Kingdom appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population, and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury, and usually appear overnight. Archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but these do not appear overnight, and are always in the same places every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1678 news pamphlet &lt;em&gt;The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire&lt;/em&gt; describes a crop whose stalks were cut rather than bent. In 1686, English naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms in &lt;em&gt;The Natural History of Stafford-Shire&lt;/em&gt;, proposing air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991, meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles. An 1880 letter to the editor of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how several circles of flattened crops in a field were formed under suspicious circumstances and possibly caused by &amp;ldquo;cyclonic wind action&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;20th-century&#34;&gt;20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester. In &lt;em&gt;Fortean Times,&lt;/em&gt; David Wood reported that in 1940 he made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. In 1963, Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire and several circular and elliptical areas in nearby wheat fields. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes. During the 1960s, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada. On 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo;. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported they started creating crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo; case. The first film to depict a geometric crop circle, in this case created by super-intelligent ants, was the 1974 science-fiction film &lt;em&gt;Phase IV&lt;/em&gt;. The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared and spread since the late 1970s. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity. The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bower-and-chorley&#34;&gt;Bower and Chorley &lt;a href=&#34;#bower-and-chorley&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, made headlines by saying they had started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978, using simple tools. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a &amp;ldquo;cereologist&amp;rdquo;, Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978â€“1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;art-and-business&#34;&gt;Art and business &lt;a href=&#34;#art-and-business&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reports of simple circles in the 1970s, increasingly complex geometric designs have been created by anonymous artists, in some cases to attract tourists to an area. Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of its art practice and also for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set that was released on 7 September 1990, features an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. On the night of 11â€“12 July 1992, a crop-circle-making competition with a prize of Â£3,000 was held in Berkshire. In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own. In 2009, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts. A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A 3 ha (7 acres) crop circle depicting the emblem of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;legal-implications&#34;&gt;Legal implications &lt;a href=&#34;#legal-implications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1992, GÃ¡bor TakÃ¡cs and RÃ³bert Dallos, both then aged 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle in Hungary. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-origin&#34;&gt;Human origin &lt;a href=&#34;#human-origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-origins&#34;&gt;Natural origins &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather &lt;a href=&#34;#weather&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes. In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm. In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;animal-activity&#34;&gt;Animal activity &lt;a href=&#34;#animal-activity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-explanations&#34;&gt;Alternative explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In science magazines from the 1980s and 1990s, one could read reports suggesting that the plants were bent by something that could be microwave radiation, rather than broken by physical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paranormal&#34;&gt;Paranormal &lt;a href=&#34;#paranormal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have been the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators, ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lightning and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Responding to local beliefs that &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial beings&amp;rdquo; in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &amp;ldquo;man-made&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes-to-crops&#34;&gt;Changes to crops &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-to-crops&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have claimed to observe differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;related-art&#34;&gt;Related art &lt;a href=&#34;#related-art&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow, by using skis, snow shoes or just walking with ordinary shoes. Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in sand. Images can be made in forests by cutting trees, especially in areas with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;folklore&#34;&gt;Folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Crop circles are culture dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularised Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they do not appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of &amp;ldquo;fairie rings&amp;rdquo;. A 17th-century English woodcut called the &lt;em&gt;Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt; depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. In the&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ancient-astronauts&#34;&gt;Ancient Astronauts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-astronauts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced the development of human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected modern cultures, technologies, religions, and human biology. A common idea is that deities from religions are extraterrestrial in origin, with advanced technologies interpreted as divine status by early humans. Academics and archaeologists dismiss these claims as pseudoarchaeological or unscientific, lacking credible peer-reviewed studies. Some argue that ancient astronaut theories have racist undertones, diminishing the accomplishments of indigenous cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI. Believers maintain that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence who landed on Earth in the past. They propose that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these visitors, who acted as a &amp;ldquo;mother culture.&amp;rdquo; Proponents also claim that extraterrestrials built structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island or aided humans in their construction. Evidence is drawn from documentary gaps in historical and archaeological records, as well as archaeological artifacts considered anachronistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is featured in fringe media, such as the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The show mixes fact with fiction to spread theories of an alternate past, often aligning with white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents portray themselves as an oppressed minority of academics, claiming a conspiracy by &amp;lsquo;big archaeology&amp;rsquo; to disenfranchise them. They focus on monumental archaeological structures, implying that non-white Indigenous people could not have built them without extraterrestrial intervention. However, some indigenous voices argue that the idea of extraterrestrials supports their own origin stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common feature in these stories portrays aliens as light-skinned or Aryan, as claimed by Erich von DÃ¤niken. Some proponents are associated with white supremacism, though their theories are sometimes applied to European cultures. Mainstream archaeologists largely ignored these claims until recently, while skeptics universally panned them. Carl Sagan noted that cases of interest have reasonable alternative explanations or are misreported, fabricated, or distorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34;&gt;History of Ancient Aliens Beliefs and Their Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paleocontact narratives first appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt; (1898) and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It gained popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and Erich von DÃ¤niken&amp;rsquo;s works. Critics emerged in the 1970s, discrediting Von DÃ¤niken&amp;rsquo;s claims. Ufologists separated the idea from the UFO controversy, and by the early 1980s, little support remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shklovskii-and-sagan&#34;&gt;Shklovskii and Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#shklovskii-and-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan co-authored &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966) with Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky. In &lt;em&gt;Broca&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1979), Sagan suggested that he and Shklovsky might have inspired the wave of 1970s ancient astronaut books, disapproving of &amp;ldquo;von DÃ¤niken and other uncritical writers&amp;rdquo; who built on these ideas as valid evidence. Sagan pointed out that many legends, artifacts, and purported out-of-place artifacts cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses could be easily explained with more conventional hypotheses. He reiterated that extraterrestrial visits to Earth were possible but unproven and improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;erich-von-dÃ¤niken&#34;&gt;Erich von DÃ¤niken &lt;a href=&#34;#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erich von DÃ¤niken was a leading proponent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining a large audience through his book &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; (1968) and its sequels. He argued that certain artifacts required more sophisticated technology than was available to ancient cultures, suggesting they were constructed by extraterrestrial visitors or humans who learned from them. Examples include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von DÃ¤niken wrote that ancient art and iconography illustrate air and space vehicles, non-human creatures, ancient astronauts, and advanced technology. He stated that geographically separated cultures share artistic themes, implying a common origin. He interpreted the sarcophagus lid of Maya ruler Pacal the Great as a seated astronaut, while the iconography identifies it as a portrait of the ruler with the World Tree of Maya mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He interpreted the origins of religions as reactions to encounters with an alien race, considering their technology supernatural and the aliens themselves as gods. He stated that religious traditions contain references to alien visitors in the way of descriptions of stars and vehicular objects traveling through air and space. One such is Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s revelation, which DÃ¤niken interprets as a landing spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von DÃ¤niken&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. after the NBC-TV documentary &lt;em&gt;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; and the film &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;. Critics argue that von DÃ¤niken misrepresented data, that many of his claims were unfounded, and that none of his core claims have been validated. The Christian creationist community is highly critical of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Nazca Lines, von DÃ¤niken stated that they gave him the impression of an airfield. Kenneth L. Feder argues that readers seeing the Nazca Lines for the first time in a book about aliens would be more likely to associate those features with extraterrestrial origins. In 1970, von DÃ¤niken admitted that the Nazca markings &amp;ldquo;could have been laid out on their gigantic scale by working from a model using a system of coordinates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s series &lt;em&gt;The Earth Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;, beginning with &lt;em&gt;The 12th Planet&lt;/em&gt;, revolves around his interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts. He hypothesized that the gods of old Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet &amp;ldquo;Nibiru,&amp;rdquo; which the Sumerians believed to be a remote &amp;ldquo;12th planet&amp;rdquo; associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin argued that Sumerian texts tell the story that 50 Anunnaki, inhabitants of Nibiru, came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago to mine raw materials, especially gold. They genetically engineered laborers to work the mines, creating &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/em&gt;: the &amp;ldquo;Adapa&amp;rdquo; or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the abrupt end of the last ice age some 12,000 years ago. Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s work has not received mainstream scholarly support. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s translations are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan F. Alford, author of &lt;em&gt;Gods of the New Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996), was an adherent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis but now finds fault with Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis, stating that the gods personified the falling sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;robert-temple&#34;&gt;Robert Temple &lt;a href=&#34;#robert-temple&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert K. G. Temple&amp;rsquo;s 1976 book, &lt;em&gt;The Sirius Mystery,&lt;/em&gt; argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes evidence, including advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations. His work draws heavily on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies within Temple&amp;rsquo;s account and suggested that the Dogon may have received some of their astronomical information recently from European sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various new religious movements, including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, RaÃ«lism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate, believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these faiths see both ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens from other planetary systems. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities which suggest that members of these groups consciously or subliminally associate enchantment with the memes of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;claims-of-proponents&#34;&gt;Claims of Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#claims-of-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among scientists, the consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; cited as evidence can be explained without having to invoke ancient astronauts. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancient-religious-texts&#34;&gt;Ancient Religious Texts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-religious-texts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents cite ancient mythologies to support their viewpoints, based on the idea that ancient creation myths of gods who descend from the heavens to Earth to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors, whose superior technology accounts for their perception as gods. Proponents draw an analogy to occurrences in modern time when isolated cultures are exposed to advanced technology, such as when, in the early 20th century, &amp;ldquo;cargo cults&amp;rdquo; were discovered in the South Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Sumerian myth of &lt;em&gt;EnÃ»ma EliÅ¡&lt;/em&gt;, inscribed on cuneiform tablets and part of the Library of Ashurbanipal, says humankind was created to&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction (also called abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction) refers to the phenomenon of people reporting what they believe to be the real experience of being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation.[1] People claiming to have been abducted are usually called &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo;[2] or &amp;ldquo;experiencers&amp;rdquo;. Most scientists and mental health professionals explain these experiences by factors such as suggestibility (e.g. false memory syndrome), sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology.[3] Skeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between some of the aliens described by abductees and those depicted in science fiction films, in particular Invaders From Mars (1953).[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical claims involve forced medical examinations that emphasize the subject&amp;rsquo;s reproductive systems.[5] Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuses and the dangers of nuclear weapons,[6] or to have engaged in interspecies breeding.[7] The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.[4] Unidentified flying objects (UFOs), alien abduction, and mind control plots can also be part of radical political apocalyptic and millenarian narratives.[8]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Fictional Depictions of Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-depictions-of-extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article provides an overview of how extraterrestrial life is portrayed in fiction, distinguishing it from claims of actual alien encounters. It notes that the article relies heavily on a limited number of sources and encourages readers to contribute additional citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the evolution of extraterrestrial depictions in fiction from antiquity to modern times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;antiquity&#34;&gt;Antiquity &lt;a href=&#34;#antiquity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection begins with Lucian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True History&lt;/em&gt; (2nd century) as an early example of extraterrestrial encounters, featuring a visit to the Moon. It explains that early concepts of extraterrestrials were closely tied to the understanding of astronomy and the prevailing anthropocentric view, where aliens were essentially humans from other celestial bodies. Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;MicromÃ©gas&lt;/em&gt; (1752) and works by Johannes Kepler, Francis Godwin, and Cyrano de Bergerac are mentioned as examples where extraterrestrials differed from humans only in culture or size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early 20th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the impact of Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; (1859) on alien depictions, leading to more diverse and non-humanoid portrayals. Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s works, H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; (1898) and &lt;em&gt;The First Men in the Moon&lt;/em&gt; (1901), Stanley G. Weinbaum&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A Martian Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; (1934), and Olaf Stapledon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Star Maker&lt;/em&gt; (1937) are highlighted as examples of genuinely alien lifeforms. It also notes that many works still featured human-like aliens. &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; is analyzed for its use of Darwinian evolution, exploration of alien life implications, critique of British imperialism, and introduction of alien invasion tropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-20th-century-1&#34;&gt;Early 20th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-20th-century-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the rise of pulp magazines and their influence on science fiction. It notes the prevalence of quasi-human aliens, monstrous invaders, and the inversion of the alien invasion trope with humans conquering alien worlds. The section also mentions the common setting of stories within the Solar System and the shift brought about by Stanley G. Weinbaum&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A Martian Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a unique Martian ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-times&#34;&gt;Modern Times &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-times&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the evolution of alien depictions in modern times, starting with &lt;em&gt;The Eternaut&lt;/em&gt; by HÃ©ctor GermÃ¡n Oesterheld, which critiques imperialism and colonialism through an alien invasion of Buenos Aires. The Barney and Betty Hill incident (1961) is mentioned as the origin of the &amp;ldquo;grey alien&amp;rdquo; archetype. The impact of TV and films, particularly &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, on popularizing extraterrestrial themes is discussed. The section concludes by noting the influence of computer-generated imagery (CGI) on creating more diverse and bizarre alien lifeforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types&#34;&gt;Types &lt;a href=&#34;#types&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section categorizes the various ways extraterrestrials are portrayed in fiction, including their intelligence levels, biological forms, and attitudes towards humanity. It notes that aliens may be hostile invaders, friendly allies, or indifferent observers. The section also mentions that some extraterrestrials may originate from unexplored regions of Earth, such as the sea, sky, underground, or other dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

It clarifies that the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial being&amp;rdquo; in this context differs from the biological definition of &amp;ldquo;alien species&amp;rdquo; in ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;list&#34;&gt;List &lt;a href=&#34;#list&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents a table outlining alleged extraterrestrial beings, providing their names, descriptions, and associated events or concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flatwoods Monster:&lt;/strong&gt; A tall humanoid with a spade-shaped head, linked to the Flatwoods Monster incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greys:&lt;/strong&gt; Grey-skinned humanoids, typically around 1 meter tall, hairless, with large heads and black almond-shaped eyes. They are associated with the Roswell incident and are the most common type of extraterrestrial being reported since the 1960s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopkinsville Goblin:&lt;/strong&gt; Small, greenish-silver humanoids, connected to the Kellyâ€“Hopkinsville encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Green Men:&lt;/strong&gt; Diminutive green humanoids, a classic cultural stereotype, though actual abduction reports rarely match this description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nordic Aliens:&lt;/strong&gt; Humanoids with stereotypical &amp;ldquo;Nordic&amp;rdquo; features (tall, blonde hair, blue eyes). They are sometimes called Space Brothers and include groups like the Plejaren (previously known as Pleiadeans), Venusians, Tall Whites, and Agarthans from Agartha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptozoological Animals and Cryptobotanical Plants:&lt;/strong&gt; Creatures from folklore, religion, and mythology (e.g., golems, dwarves, giants from Atlantis), as well as reports of ghosts, poltergeists, and time travelers. Examples include the Mothman, Jersey Devil, Loch Ness Monster, Nommo, Mokele-mbembe, Yokai, Quinametzin, Rephaite, and Loveland Frogman. Some believe these creatures are of extraterrestrial or mixed origin, as suggested by the extraterrestrial, interdimensional, or cryptoterrestrial hypotheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reptilians and Reptiloids:&lt;/strong&gt; Tall, scaly humanoids, sometimes linked to ancient astronauts. They include Draconians and Orion reptilian-humanoid matriarchies. David Icke is a prominent advocate of the reptilian conspiracy theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rods or Skyfish:&lt;/strong&gt; Elongated visual artifacts in photos and videos, sometimes claimed to be extraterrestrial beings, but generally believed to be motion blur from flying insects.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be immediately identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and escalated during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained. Government investigations and studies by various organizations have occurred over the years, but without confirmation of claims that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence or other unconventional hypotheses. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes. The philosophical implications of UFOs relate to epistemology, dealing with temporarily or permanently unknowable anomalous phenomena. The U.S. government has two entities dedicated to UFO data collection and analysis: NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the Department of Defense&amp;rsquo;s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs,&amp;rdquo; originating from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to replace the misleading term &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has gained usage in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; UAP is sometimes expanded to &amp;ldquo;unidentified anomalous phenomenon.&amp;rdquo; In popular culture, UFO has become synonymous with alien spacecraft, sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena after careful investigation. Common identified sources include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. The USAF&amp;rsquo;s 1952â€“1955 study categorized UFOs as balloons, astronomical objects, aircraft, light phenomena, birds, clouds, dust, insufficient information, psychological manifestations, unknown, and other. Allan Hendry, a CUFOS researcher, found that fewer than one percent of cases were hoaxes, with most sightings being misidentifications of prosaic phenomena due to inexperience or misperception. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that thorough investigation often reveals less to the stories than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, planetary conjunctions, and optical phenomena. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet, first recorded by Chinese astronomers, was often seen as a supernatural portent or omen. Some UFO enthusiasts have drawn parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, but art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens, a Roman writer, documented wonders and portents in Rome between 249 and 12 BCE, with descriptions resembling meteor showers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo, a Song Chinese scholar-official, described a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in his &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt; (1088).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woodcut by Hans Glaser from 1561, known as the &amp;ldquo;celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg,&amp;rdquo; has been linked to ancient astronaut claims, though skeptics argue it depicts a sundog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A similar report from 1566 over Basel, along with other leaflets from the 15th and 16th centuries, described &amp;ldquo;miracles&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sky spectacles&amp;rdquo; resembling natural phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1878, farmer John Martin reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer, marking one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From November 1896 to April 1897, newspapers reported numerous sightings of &amp;ldquo;mystery airships,&amp;rdquo; with some people claiming to have spoken to the pilots. Thomas Edison dismissed these reports as fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings included St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire, the planet Venus, hallucinations, and German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, referred to as &amp;ldquo;Russian hail&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected, primarily by the Swedish military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science fiction depictions of spacecraft similar to flying saucers predated the first widely reported UFO sighting in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO craze began with the Kenneth Arnold sighting on June 24, 1947, when he described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; near Mount Rainier. Within weeks, reports of flying saucer sightings became common, including the Roswell incident in 1947. In 1950, influential books by Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, and Gerald Heard proposed the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media speculation ran rampant, especially during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. By 1953, intelligence officials worried that genuine incursions by enemy aircraft could be lost in a flood of UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force began investigating UFO reports through Project Sign, followed by Project Grudge and Project Blue Book. In the late 1950s, public pressure mounted for declassification of UFO records, but the CIA resisted. Official U.S. Air Force interest in UFO reports ended in 1969 after the Condon Report concluded that further investigation was not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became part of American popular culture&amp;rsquo;s obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. In 1961, the Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gained notoriety. In 1966, 5% of Americans reported seeing something they thought was a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention increased with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, funded from 2007 to 2012. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream attention to UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims more fully. In May 2022, the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee held congressional hearings on UAPs, the first public hearing on UFO sightings in the US in over 50 years. Another Congressional hearing took place on July 26, 2023, featuring the whistleblower claims of former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls have shown varying levels of belief in UFOs among Americans, with some indicating that a significant percentage believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFOs have been taken up by religious studies scholars, and popular culture has played a significant role in shaping public perception of extraterrestrials.&lt;/p&gt;

No official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known government studies include the Swedish military&amp;rsquo;s ghost rockets investigation (1946â€“1947), Project Blue Book by the USAF (1947â€“1969), Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948â€“1951), Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 by the Battelle Memorial Institute, and the Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s OperaÃ§Ã£o Prato (1977). France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN) since 1977, and Uruguay has had a similar investigation since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;allianceunion-universe&#34;&gt;Allianceâ€“Union Universe &lt;a href=&#34;#allianceunion-universe&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article provides an overview of the Allianceâ€“Union universe, a fictional setting created by C. J. Cherryh for her science fiction novels and short stories. It details the universe&amp;rsquo;s history, key factions, technologies, and alien species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the Allianceâ€“Union universe as a future history spanning the third and fourth millennia, focusing on humanity&amp;rsquo;s expansion into space. It identifies the three major economic and political powers: Earth Company, the Alliance (a confederation of interstellar trade merchants), and the Union (a breakaway government based on Cyteen). The section highlights the Company Wars, Earth Company&amp;rsquo;s failed attempts to control space expansion, and the Union&amp;rsquo;s use of cloned humans (&lt;em&gt;azi&lt;/em&gt;) in its quest for territory. It also mentions that the Allianceâ€“Union universe includes other series like &lt;em&gt;Faded Sun&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chanur&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Morgaine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Merovingen Nights&lt;/em&gt;. Patricia Monk&amp;rsquo;s concept of a &amp;ldquo;megatext&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;collage novel&amp;rdquo; is introduced, suggesting that linking these series creates a larger, interconnected narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the chronological development of the Allianceâ€“Union universe. It begins with the establishment of space stations by the Earth Company and the emergence of distinct stationer and merchanter cultures. The discovery of Pell&amp;rsquo;s World in the Tau Ceti system, with its hospitable environment and alien life (the Hisa), disrupts the existing power balance. The development of faster-than-light (FTL) travel leads to Earth&amp;rsquo;s attempts to reassert control, culminating in the Company Wars. The Union, centered at the Cyteen system, declares independence and uses genetically engineered clones (&lt;em&gt;azi&lt;/em&gt;) in its military. The conflict reaches a turning point at Pell Station, leading to the formation of the Alliance as a neutral power. Conrad Mazian, commander of the Earth Company Fleet, refuses to accept peace and becomes a renegade. Signy Mallory, one of his captains, defects to the Alliance. The Mazianni are eventually driven off, but a new rivalry emerges between the Alliance and Union. The section concludes by mentioning the political factions within Union and the role of scientist Ariane Emory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genre&#34;&gt;Genre &lt;a href=&#34;#genre&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section classifies the various works within the Allianceâ€“Union universe by genre. Many stories set in space are considered space opera, while those on planets are planetary romances. Works like &lt;em&gt;Cyteen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Downbelow Station&lt;/em&gt; are also hard science fiction. The &amp;ldquo;Company Wars&amp;rdquo; novels and the &lt;em&gt;Faded Sun&lt;/em&gt; trilogy are military science fiction. The &lt;em&gt;Merovingen Nights&lt;/em&gt; series is classified as science fantasy, and &lt;em&gt;The Morgaine Cycle&lt;/em&gt; books are set remotely in time and space. &lt;em&gt;Voyager in Night&lt;/em&gt; incorporates elements of horror fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;books-and-reading-order&#34;&gt;Books and Reading Order &lt;a href=&#34;#books-and-reading-order&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides guidance on the order in which to read the books set in the Allianceâ€“Union universe. C. J. Cherryh states that most books can be read in any order, with two exceptions: &lt;em&gt;Heavy Time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hellburner&lt;/em&gt; should be read in that order, and &lt;em&gt;Cyteen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Regenesis&lt;/em&gt; should be read in sequence. The novels in the &lt;em&gt;Faded Sun&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chanur&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Morgaine&lt;/em&gt; series are also designed to be read in order. The &lt;em&gt;Merovingen Nights&lt;/em&gt; series begins with &lt;em&gt;Angel with the Sword&lt;/em&gt; and continues with the short story anthologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;major-characters&#34;&gt;Major Characters &lt;a href=&#34;#major-characters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section lists and describes some of the most important characters in the Allianceâ€“Union universe. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ariane Emory-1 and Ariane Emory-2 PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Scientist and her clone from Cyteen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damon Konstantin and Elene Quen:&lt;/strong&gt; Leaders of Pell Station and the Merchanter Alliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conrad Mazian:&lt;/strong&gt; Commander of the Earth Company Fleet and later leader of the Mazianni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signy Mallory:&lt;/strong&gt; Captain of the &lt;em&gt;Norway&lt;/em&gt; who defects to the Alliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth McGee:&lt;/strong&gt; Union scientist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Robert Neihart:&lt;/strong&gt; Senior captain of &lt;em&gt;Finity&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kurt Morgan:&lt;/strong&gt; Survivor of the &lt;em&gt;Endymion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The table includes the species name, home system, home planet, the works in which they appear, and brief notes about their characteristics. Some of the species listed are the Amaut, Ahnit, Caliban, Chi, Elee, Hani, Hisa, Iduve, Kallia, Kif, Knnn, Majat, Mahendo&amp;rsquo;sat, Mri, Nemet, Regul, Stsho, Sharrh, Shonunin, and Tc&amp;rsquo;a. The section also mentions the Qual/Khal from the &lt;em&gt;Morgaine&lt;/em&gt; books and the Harilim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pell&amp;rsquo;s World (Downbelow):&lt;/strong&gt; A planet orbiting Tau Ceti, notable for its advanced ecosystem, intelligent extraterrestrial life (the Hisa), and its impact on the balance of power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gehenna:&lt;/strong&gt; A habitable planet in the Zeta Reticuli system, secretly colonized by the Union and home to the calibans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyteen:&lt;/strong&gt; A planet deep in Union territory, with a toxic atmosphere and native life, known for its rejuvenation drug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merovin:&lt;/strong&gt; An isolated planet with backward technology due to poor interstellar relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;technologies&#34;&gt;Technologies &lt;a href=&#34;#technologies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the signature futuristic technologies of the Allianceâ€“Union universe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jump Drive:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows faster-than-light travel by shifting ships into a parallel space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejuv:&lt;/strong&gt; A life-extension drug derived from Cyteen&amp;rsquo;s lifeforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Cloning:&lt;/strong&gt; Used extensively by the Union to create &lt;em&gt;azi&lt;/em&gt;, genetically tailored laborers and soldiers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tape:&lt;/strong&gt; Subliminal conditioning and information transfer used for various purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraforming:&lt;/strong&gt; Technologies used to make areas of Cyteen suitable for Earth-based life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;society&#34;&gt;Society &lt;a href=&#34;#society&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section describes the societal structures and attitudes within the Allianceâ€“Union universe. It highlights the divergence of attitudes between planet-dwellers, space station-dwellers, and starship crews. Space station residents are cautious, while starship crews have an insular worldview due to the effects of jump. In Union, there is a division between unengineered citizens (CITs) and &lt;em&gt;azi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mazianni&#34;&gt;Mazianni &lt;a href=&#34;#mazianni&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section defines the &lt;em&gt;Mazianni&lt;/em&gt; as the military starships and their crews who remained loyal to Conrad Mazian after he renounced his allegiance to Earth. It describes their origins as the Earth Company Fleet, their role in the Company War, and their subsequent guerrilla warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;songs&#34;&gt;Songs &lt;a href=&#34;#songs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions that C. J. Cherryh wrote a collection of songs about the station trade, which were recorded by filk musician Leslie Fish and released on an album entitled &lt;em&gt;Finity&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-reception&#34;&gt;Critical Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the critical reception of the Allianceâ€“Union universe. John Clute called it Cherryh&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;central achievement,&amp;rdquo; noting its rough edges but the impression of a larger, yet-to-be-revealed history. M. Keith Booker described it as &amp;ldquo;so far-reaching that its overall outlines remain unclear and continue to develop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section lists the references cited in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ashtar-extraterrestrial-being&#34;&gt;Ashtar (Extraterrestrial Being) &lt;a href=&#34;#ashtar-extraterrestrial-being&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashtar, sometimes referred to as Ashtar Sheran, is the name attributed to an alleged extraterrestrial being or group of beings that some individuals claim to have channeled. The first claim of receiving an Ashtar message came from UFO contactee George Van Tassel in 1952. Following Van Tassel&amp;rsquo;s claims, numerous other mediums also asserted contact, presenting conflicting messages. Ashtar is often depicted as a humanoid with blond hair and European features, leading to associations with Nordic aliens. The Ashtar movement is studied as a prominent form of UFO religion. The Czech Universe People, for example, venerate Ashtar alongside figures like Jesus and Krishna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides background information and details the development of the Ashtar phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of Ascended Masters from esoteric teachings reappearing in spacesuits is discussed in the context of UFO religions. Theosophy, particularly Helena Blavatsky&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Secret Doctrine&lt;/em&gt;, is mentioned as containing references to extraterrestrial masters. The term &amp;ldquo;ashtar&amp;rdquo; itself appears in Blavatsky&amp;rsquo;s work, referring to the Sanskrit term ashtar-vidya, meaning advanced warfare technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purported-contact-with-van-tassel&#34;&gt;Purported contact with Van Tassel &lt;a href=&#34;#purported-contact-with-van-tassel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Van Tassel&amp;rsquo;s claim of telepathic communication with Ashtar in 1952 is detailed. Van Tassel interpreted the Bible in terms of extraterrestrial intervention and claimed Jesus was a being from space. He asserted that humans could tap into the &amp;ldquo;Universal Mind of God&amp;rdquo; and receive messages from Ashtar and deceased individuals like Nikola Tesla. From Tesla, he claimed to receive instructions to build the Integratron, a machine to extend lifespan and access knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Tassel&amp;rsquo;s early messages from Ashtar focused on apocalyptic concerns regarding the hydrogen bomb. It was claimed that Ashtar, as Commander in Chief of the Ashtar Galactic Command, entered the Solar System to warn humanity about the dangers of nuclear detonation. The messages stated the space command was determined to prevent Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction and was assisting the human race. Van Tassel claimed to have been tasked with delivering specific messages to the U.S. federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Tassel claimed his communication method involved a new form of telepathy utilizing both human abilities and advanced alien technology, rather than traditional spiritual mediumship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;giant-rock-space-conventions&#34;&gt;Giant Rock Space Conventions &lt;a href=&#34;#giant-rock-space-conventions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Tassel held weekly channeling sessions at Giant Rock, California, where people could ask questions and channel answers from extraterrestrials. These gatherings helped coalesce the contactee subculture. The annual Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention, organized by Van Tassel, began in 1953 and continued for at least 24 years. These conventions attracted thousands of attendees and featured channeled messages from space. Many well-known UFO contactees attended as speakers and channelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ashtar-command&#34;&gt;Ashtar Command &lt;a href=&#34;#ashtar-command&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of an &amp;ldquo;Ashtar Command&amp;rdquo; was appropriated by various contactees and channelers, based on Van Tassel&amp;rsquo;s Ashtar figure. Robert Short, editor of &lt;em&gt;Interplanetary News Digest&lt;/em&gt;, popularized the messages but later formed his own group called &amp;ldquo;Ashtar Command&amp;rdquo; due to disagreements with Van Tassel. By the mid-1950s, the idea of Ashtar and a galactic law enforcement agency preparing to rescue humanity was established. Elouise Moeller and Adelaide J. Brown made predictions about space fleets and flourishing civilizations on other planets. The failure of these predictions negatively impacted the movement due to a lack of central authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development-into-spiritual-religion-1990s-onward&#34;&gt;Development into spiritual religion (1990s onward) &lt;a href=&#34;#development-into-spiritual-religion-1990s-onward&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ashtar message evolved from a technological communication to a more spiritual message, with Ashtar taking on the role of an Ascended Master. The Ashtar Command became a diffuse New Age Spiritualist movement with varied teachings. Tuella founded Guardian Action International. Andreas Grunschloss describes much of the Ashtar channeling as akin to cargo cults, blending spiritual ascension with alien technologies. Millenarian concepts involved a transformation of humans via these technologies, who would then return to Earth to enjoy a golden millennium. Later, teachings were modified to include a less material and more spiritual emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1970s-broadcasts&#34;&gt;1970s broadcasts &lt;a href=&#34;#1970s-broadcasts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, a British radio talk show received a call-in claiming to originate from outer space. This was followed by the 1977 Southern Television broadcast interruption, when a voice calling itself &amp;ldquo;Vrillon&amp;rdquo; of the Ashtar Galactic Command temporarily took over a television transmitter in southern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1986-prediction-of-1994-apocalypse&#34;&gt;1986 prediction of 1994 apocalypse &lt;a href=&#34;#1986-prediction-of-1994-apocalypse&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yvonne Cole, who claimed to channel Ashtar messages from 1986, predicted the destruction of Earth civilizations and the arrival of alien cultures in 1994. Cole claimed governments were working with extraterrestrials to prepare for contact. The landing would be broadcast globally and include a message from the Ashtar Command. These prophecies furthered the fracturing and disappointment within the movement when they failed to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-1994-pioneer-voyage-meditations&#34;&gt;The 1994 Pioneer Voyage meditations &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1994-pioneer-voyage-meditations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, a group of Ashtar Command members claimed to have experienced &amp;ldquo;the lift-off experience,&amp;rdquo; being placed aboard &amp;ldquo;ships of Light&amp;rdquo; circling the planet. A second event was predicted for December 1994, involving over 250 people, which was declared to have &amp;ldquo;opened a portal to the AC (Ashtar Command) ships for ever.&amp;rdquo; Participants were said to have their vibrations raised through a contemplative procedure, and the Pioneer Voyage would occur during meditation. This evoked &amp;ldquo;memory recall&amp;rdquo; from members who began providing accounts of their &amp;ldquo;time aboard the ships.&amp;rdquo; The group claims the purpose of the lift-off is for the ascension of the human race, aided by electronic grids deployed around the planet by guardian ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;developments-after-the-mid-1990s&#34;&gt;Developments after the mid-1990s &lt;a href=&#34;#developments-after-the-mid-1990s&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the mid-1990s, channeling groups began using the Internet to unify the movement and establish an authoritative source for Ashtar messages. This addressed the problem of conflicting prophecies and enabled the Ashtar Command to produce a single Ashtar worldview. Channelers espousing messages focusing on destruction, conspiracies, and fear-mongering were declared invalid, claiming they had been deceived by negative space beings. The movement declared that future channels would only be accepted if they operated on the &amp;ldquo;level of the soul.&amp;rdquo; Channeled messages would be accepted if they complied with a set of twelve guidelines. The new framework claimed that spaceships would not interfere on Earth unless there was a serious problem. The emergent group was more spiritually focused and less concerned with spaceships. The Pioneer Voyage was incorporated into the Ashtar worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credibility&#34;&gt;Credibility &lt;a href=&#34;#credibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the credibility of the Ashtar claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of the July 1952 prediction that life on Earth would be destroyed by the hydrogen atom is noted. However, the message also stated that Ashtar was intervening to stop the destruction. After the explosion, messages claimed that Ashtar&amp;rsquo;s space fleet took actions to repair damage. The Ashtar belief system is based on faith in an extraterrestrial celebrity, and shifts in content seem due to failed prophecy, moving the emphasis from a physical space fleet to the concept of an Ascended Master aiding spiritual advancement. The Ashtar beliefs are seen as a syncretism between the I AM movements and the UFO experience. Though followers believe in Ashtar&amp;rsquo;s divine right and knowledge, he and others have yet to provide any physical evidence of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as physical spacecraft occupied by intelligent extraterrestrial organisms or probes designed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature back to the 1960s. Key figures mentioned include French ufologist Jacques VallÃ©e, who used the term in his 1966 book, and French engineer AimÃ© Michel. James E. McDonald and James Harder also used the term in 1968, including during testimony before Congress. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; in 1969 when presenting the findings of the Condon Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical roots of the ETH, tracing it back to earlier concepts such as Percival Lowell&amp;rsquo;s ideas about Martian canals and civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups like NICAP and APRO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34;&gt;Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides examples of early speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a story from 1864 about American geologists discovering an alien-like creature inside an egg-shaped structure. It also discusses H. G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; and the &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; reported in the late 19th century, with some speculating they were from Mars. The section also notes the influence of comic strips, radio, and movie serials like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon on popularizing the idea of alien visitation in spaceships. The 1938 radio broadcast of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; by Orson Welles is mentioned as creating public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34;&gt;The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the events following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting of unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier in June 1947. It notes that Arnold quickly considered the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial. The section mentions the speculation in newspapers about the nature of the objects, including comments from U.S. Senator Glen Taylor and R. DeWitt Miller. It also references Charles Fort&amp;rsquo;s earlier documentation of unidentified flying objects. The section highlights that most people were initially unwilling to conclude the objects were extraterrestrial, with theories such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria being more popular. It cites a Gallup poll from August 1947 showing that most people either had no opinion or believed in a mundane explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-public-opinion&#34;&gt;Evolution of Public Opinion &lt;a href=&#34;#evolution-of-public-opinion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section examines how public opinion on UFOs and the ETH evolved. It mentions the release of several movies in the early 1950s depicting flying saucers and aliens. It cites a &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt; poll from 1951 indicating that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen man-made aircraft, while only a small percentage believed they had seen an alien craft. By 1957, a quarter of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A Roper poll in 2002 reported that a majority of respondents thought UFOs were real, with nearly half believing they had visited Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion&#34;&gt;Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society founded by George King in 1955 as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses NASA&amp;rsquo;s evolving stance on UAPs. It mentions that in June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP using scientific methods. Kopparapu presented a paper in August 2021 that supported ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-or-government-studies&#34;&gt;Private or Government Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#private-or-government-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details private and governmental studies that have supported the ETH or had members who dissented from official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Estimate of the Situation in 1948, which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation for unexplained cases, but was ordered destroyed. A secret West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s internal review of UFOs is mentioned, with some scientists considering the ETH. The section also notes individuals within Project Blue Book, such as Major Dewey Fournet and consultant J. Allen Hynek, who supported the ETH. Statements from former CIA Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter and Greek physicist Paul Santorini are included. The section also mentions the COMETA report, and Jean-Jacques Velasco&amp;rsquo;s book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34;&gt;Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It states that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien presence on Earth. It notes that no rigorous analysis has ever concluded that UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34;&gt;U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery &lt;a href=&#34;#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the U.S. military&amp;rsquo;s involvement in investigating and debunking UFOs. It mentions the Army Air Forces Intelligence&amp;rsquo;s secret study of saucer reports in 1947 and the formation of Project Sign. It notes that Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The CIA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Scientific Investigation took interest in UFOs following the 1952 UFO flap. The Robertson Panel, organized by the CIA in 1953, reviewed Blue Book&amp;rsquo;s evidence and recommended a policy of public debunkery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;involvement-of-scientists&#34;&gt;Involvement of Scientists &lt;a href=&#34;#involvement-of-scientists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the scientific community&amp;rsquo;s lack of support for the ETH. It mentions Stephen Hawking&amp;rsquo;s skepticism and quotes Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s warning against self-deception in accepting or rejecting the idea of extraterrestrial visitation. It also quotes Peter A. Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s call for examining other possible theories beyond the ETH. The section presents the results of Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s polls of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and American Astronomical Society members, showing limited support for the ETH. It summarizes J. Allen Hynek&amp;rsquo;s seven key reasons for not accepting the ETH, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34;&gt;Fewer Sightings Despite Camera Phone Technology &lt;a href=&#34;#fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section notes that the proliferation of smartphone camera technology has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, which has called into question the claimed phenomenology of UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa-1&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section states NASA&amp;rsquo;s official position as of 2006, which is that the ETH lacks empirical evidence. It quotes David Morrison&amp;rsquo;s statements that no one has ever found a single artifact or convincing evidence for alien visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cia&#34;&gt;CIA &lt;a href=&#34;#cia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions the CIA&amp;rsquo;s organization of the Robertson Panel in 1953 to debunk the data collected by Project Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-white-house-position&#34;&gt;Official White House Position &lt;a href=&#34;#official-white-house-position&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section presents the White House&amp;rsquo;s official response in November 2011 to petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge alien visits and disclose any withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. The response states that the U.S. government has no evidence of life outside our planet or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Counter Critique of the Official Position: Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#counter-critique-of-the-official-position-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the concept of a conspiracy of silence or official cover-up to conceal information about UFOs. It mentions James Harder&amp;rsquo;s argument in 1968 that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs but had been suppressed. It cites a 1971 survey showing that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs than believed in the existence of UFOs or the ETH itself. It also mentions comments from former NASA astronauts Gordon Cooper and Brian O&amp;rsquo;Leary about NASA and the government suppressing UFO sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34;&gt;The Roswell Incident (1980 book) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident-1980-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on the 1980 book &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and William Moore, which significantly contributed to popularizing the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Roswell incident, starting with the events of 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;events-of-1947&#34;&gt;Events of 1947 &lt;a href=&#34;#events-of-1947&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the initial reports surrounding the Roswell incident. It mentions the flying disc craze of 1947, Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting, and the Roswell Army Air Field&amp;rsquo;s initial press release about recovering a &amp;ldquo;flying disc,&amp;rdquo; which was quickly retracted and replaced with the explanation of a weather balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roswell-revisited&#34;&gt;Roswell revisited &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-revisited&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part highlights the renewed interest in the Roswell story in 1978, sparked by an interview with retired lieutenant colonel Jesse Marcel, who claimed the debris he retrieved was of extraterrestrial origin. Stanton Friedman, a ufologist, conducted the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authors&#34;&gt;Authors &lt;a href=&#34;#authors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides background information on the authors of the book. Charles Berlitz is noted for authoring &lt;em&gt;The Bermuda Triangle&lt;/em&gt;, a bestseller that popularized the mysteries surrounding that area. William L. Moore is identified as a UFO researcher. Their previous collaboration, &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt;, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents &lt;a href=&#34;#contents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the book&amp;rsquo;s central argument: that an extraterrestrial craft crashed in New Mexico while observing nuclear weapons activity, and the US government engaged in a cover-up. It mentions accounts of debris described as &amp;ldquo;nothing made on this earth&amp;rdquo; by Jesse Marcel. Other individuals mentioned include Bill Brazel, Floyd Proctor, and Walt Whitman Jr. The book is described as &amp;ldquo;version 1&amp;rdquo; of the Roswell myth. It also introduces the idea that the debris shown in photos with Marcel was substituted as part of the cover-up and that the press was not allowed to closely inspect the recovered material. The authors claimed to have interviewed over 90 witnesses, but only a fraction of their testimonies appear in the book. The incarceration of Mac Brazel is also mentioned. The section notes that Marcel&amp;rsquo;s narrative was elevated above that of Cavitt, whose description of the debris contradicted Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-bodies&#34;&gt;Alien bodies &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-bodies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the book&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the &amp;ldquo;alien bodies&amp;rdquo; narrative. It mentions the second-hand stories of Grady &amp;ldquo;Barney&amp;rdquo; Barnett and archaeology students encountering wreckage and &amp;ldquo;alien bodies&amp;rdquo; on the Plains of San Agustin, far from the initial Roswell crash site. It also points out that some accounts of the Roswell incident contain information from the Aztec, New Mexico, UFO incident, a hoax promoted by Frank Scully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section notes that critics have deemed &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; as &amp;ldquo;a collection of wild hearsay&amp;rdquo; and that the book &amp;ldquo;did not make the commercial impact its authors hoped.&amp;rdquo; It also mentions that fingers were pointed at Moore when critics and skeptics characterized the Majestic 12 documents as fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section mentions that William Moore claimed to have engaged in &amp;ldquo;disinformation&amp;rdquo; activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations at a 1989 MUFON conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-views&#34;&gt;Modern views &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section references the 1993 inquiry from US congressman Steven Schiff, which led to a General Accounting Office investigation and an Air Force report. The 1994 Air Force report concluded that the material recovered was likely debris from Project Mogul, a military surveillance program using high-altitude balloons.&lt;/p&gt;

Each entry includes the date, city, state, a link to a main article if available, and a brief description of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dover-demon&#34;&gt;Dover Demon &lt;a href=&#34;#dover-demon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dover Demon is a cryptid reportedly sighted in Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section details the reported sightings of the Dover Demon in April 1977. William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Bartlett, John Baxter, and Abby Brabham, all teenagers at the time, independently reported seeing a strange creature. Bartlett described it as about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth, with a watermelon-shaped head, perched on a broken stone wall on Farm Street. Baxter reported a similar sighting on Miller Hill Road the same evening, and Brabham claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue. The teenagers drew sketches of the creature, with Bartlett swearing on a stack of Bibles to the accuracy of his depiction. The locations of the sightings, when plotted on a map, formed a straight line over 2 miles. The sightings became public in May, drawing comparisons to the creatures involved in the Kellyâ€“Hopkinsville encounter of 1955. The Mutual UFO Network also investigated the sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-explanations&#34;&gt;Possible explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the Dover Demon sightings. One suggestion is that the creature was a foal or a moose calf. Skeptic Joe Nickell proposes that the creature was likely a snowy owl, citing its size, plumage, and the reflection of yellow headlights in its eyes, creating the peach color described by Bartlett. Nickell also suggests that the &amp;ldquo;long spindly arms&amp;rdquo; could have been the partially opened wings of an owl. Police suggested the sightings were a hoax. Ben Radford suggests the sightings may have been influenced by the release of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the Dover Demon&amp;rsquo;s appearances in popular culture. It was featured in an episode of the American horror television series &lt;em&gt;Lost Tapes&lt;/em&gt; on Animal Planet in 2009. The Dover Demon appears as a character in the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;, where it can see into the future, and in &lt;em&gt;The Perhapanauts&lt;/em&gt;. It also made appearances in &lt;em&gt;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&lt;/em&gt;. A Dover Demon appears in the webcomic &lt;em&gt;Gunnerkrigg Court&lt;/em&gt;. In the manga series &lt;em&gt;Dandadan&lt;/em&gt;, an alien known as Dover Demon takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien with the ability to transform into a stronger form resembling that of a mantis shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;test-tube-aliens&#34;&gt;Test Tube Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#test-tube-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This entry discusses the Test Tube Aliens toy line, detailing its backstory, the toy&amp;rsquo;s features, how it functions, and providing references and external links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;story&#34;&gt;Story &lt;a href=&#34;#story&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrative revolves around two factions of aliens: the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; aliens fleeing their dying homeworld of Naratuko and the &amp;ldquo;evil&amp;rdquo; aliens responsible for its destruction, pursuing them across the universe. The good aliens genetically revert to a pre-birth state to escape, seeking a sympathetic lifeform to restore them. A later development reveals that all the original aliens are evil, with the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; aliens plotting to contaminate Earth&amp;rsquo;s water sources after being discarded. This leads to the release of a &amp;ldquo;Pure Evil&amp;rdquo; line of Test Tube Aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-toy-itself&#34;&gt;The toy itself &lt;a href=&#34;#the-toy-itself&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toy consists of a test tube containing a white cocoon or chrysalis. Adding water dissolves the cocoon, revealing an infant alien. The alien&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;heartbeat&amp;rdquo; is indicated by flashing lights. The alien requires feeding with &amp;ldquo;Sloog&amp;rdquo; and must be kept in a regular cycle of daylight and darkness to remain &amp;ldquo;healthy.&amp;rdquo; The alien can detect water levels and will signal if they are too high or too low. If not properly cared for, the alien will &amp;ldquo;die.&amp;rdquo; The toy also interacts with a now-defunct website where users could induce coma or panic modes and check the alien&amp;rsquo;s age and health. A picture of Kurion, a good alien, is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works &lt;a href=&#34;#how-it-works&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alien&amp;rsquo;s body contains Polyacrylamide, a polymer that expands when it absorbs water. The &amp;ldquo;Sloog&amp;rdquo; contains a weak acid that slows the expansion, making the growth appear gradual. Electrodes on the alien&amp;rsquo;s antenna and head sense the presence of the acid and measure water levels to determine if the alien is &amp;ldquo;healthy.&amp;rdquo; A light detector in the alien&amp;rsquo;s head responds to flashes from the website, tracking light and dark exposure. The Test Tube Alien website is currently offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section lists the sources used in the article, including a Popular Mechanics blog post by Erik Sofge titled &amp;ldquo;Test Tube Aliens: Gadget of the Week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;external-links&#34;&gt;External links &lt;a href=&#34;#external-links&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section provides a link to an archived version of the official Test Tube Aliens website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record</title>
      <link>https://alien-truth-social.github.io/books/ufos-generals-pilots-and-government-officials/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leslie Kean, a veteran investigative reporter who has spent the past ten years studying the still-unexplained UFO phenomenon, reviewed hundreds of government documents, aviation reports, radar data, and case studies with corroborating physical evidence. She interviewed dozens of high-level officials and aviation witnesses from around the world. Among them, five Air Force generals and a host of high-level sourcesâ€”including Fife Symington III, former governor of Arizona, and Nick Pope, former head of the British Defence Ministryâ€™s UFO Investigative Unitâ€”have written their own breathtaking, firsthand accounts about UFO encounters and investigations exclusively for this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the support of former White House chief of staff John Podesta, Kean lifts the veil on decades of U.S. government misinformation about this mysterious phenomenon and presents irrefutable evidence that unknown flying objectsâ€”metallic, luminous, and seemingly able to maneuver in ways that defy the laws of physicsâ€”actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;
