      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-british-tv-series&#34;&gt;UFO (British TV series) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-british-tv-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British science fiction television series that aired from 1970 to 1971, focusing on Earth&amp;rsquo;s defense against an alien invasion in the then-future of 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise &lt;a href=&#34;#premise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Earth is under threat from aliens from a dying planet who are abducting humans for their organs. SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation), a secret international military agency operating under the guise of a movie studio, is formed to defend Earth. SHADO utilizes advanced technology, including a space intruder detection satellite (SID), lunar interceptors, a submarine/aircraft called Skydiver, and ground-based SHADO Mobiles. The aliens are humanoid, requiring a green oxygenated liquid and special contact lenses. Their UFOs can travel faster than light but have limited time in Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast-and-characters&#34;&gt;Cast and characters &lt;a href=&#34;#cast-and-characters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series features a large ensemble cast with frequent changes. Ed Bishop as Commander Ed Straker is the only actor to appear in every episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-characters&#34;&gt;Main characters &lt;a href=&#34;#main-characters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commander Edward Straker (Ed Bishop):&lt;/strong&gt; The head of SHADO, posing as the head of Harlington-Straker Film Studios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colonel Paul Foster (Michael Billington):&lt;/strong&gt; A former test pilot recruited into SHADO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lieutenant Gay Ellis (Gabrielle Drake):&lt;/strong&gt; Moonbase commander.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colonel Alec Freeman (George Sewell):&lt;/strong&gt; SHADO&amp;rsquo;s second-in-command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General James Henderson (Grant Taylor):&lt;/strong&gt; Straker&amp;rsquo;s superior and president of the International Astrophysical Commission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colonel Virginia Lake (Wanda Ventham):&lt;/strong&gt; A SHADO operative who later becomes first officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Captain Peter Carlin (Peter Gordeno):&lt;/strong&gt; First commander of Skydiver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lieutenant Nina Barry (Dolores Mantez):&lt;/strong&gt; Moonbase operative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Captain Lew Waterman (Gary Myers):&lt;/strong&gt; Second commander of Skydiver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lieutenant Keith Ford (Keith Alexander):&lt;/strong&gt; Communications officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lieutenant Ayshea Johnson (Ayshea Brough):&lt;/strong&gt; SHADO headquarters officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Douglas Jackson (Vladek Sheybal):&lt;/strong&gt; SHADO psychiatrist and science officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lieutenant Joan Harrington (Antonia Ellis):&lt;/strong&gt; Moonbase operative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miss Ealand (Norma Ronald):&lt;/strong&gt; Straker&amp;rsquo;s secretary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lieutenant Mark Bradley (Harry Baird):&lt;/strong&gt; Interceptor pilot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;minor-characters&#34;&gt;Minor characters &lt;a href=&#34;#minor-characters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakira Baksh (later Michael Caine&amp;rsquo;s wife) played Joanna, a Moonbase operative. Steven Berkoff played Interceptor pilot Steve Minto, and Georgina Moon played Lieutenant Sylvia Howell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episodes&#34;&gt;Episodes &lt;a href=&#34;#episodes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 26 episodes were broadcast in a non-chronological order by ITV. The list provides the original ATV (Midlands) broadcast order, along with director, writer, original air date, and production code. Episode titles include &amp;ldquo;Identified,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Exposed,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Cat with Ten Lives,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Conflict,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;A Question of Priorities,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Long Sleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different viewing orders exist, including production order, ATV broadcast order, and recommended orders by UFO Series, Fanderson, and ITC. A table compares these different orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lew Grade approached Gerry Anderson to create a live-action TV series, resulting in &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt;. The series was influenced by UFO sightings and Christiaan Barnard&amp;rsquo;s transplant operations. Sylvia Anderson designed the costumes, including the purple wigs for female Moonbase staff. The Harlington-Straker Studio was the actual studio where the series was filmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filming began in April 1969 at MGM-British Studios, then moved to Pinewood Studios in June 1970. George Sewell and Gabrielle Drake left after the studio change. Harry Baird and Peter Gordeno also left the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;costumes&#34;&gt;Costumes &lt;a href=&#34;#costumes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female Moonbase personnel wore purple wigs, silver catsuits, and heavy eye makeup for a futuristic look. Ed Bishop initially bleached his hair, then wore a white wig. Other male characters also wore wigs. Only two alien suits were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;special-effects&#34;&gt;Special effects &lt;a href=&#34;#special-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Meddings supervised the special effects, using techniques like double-walled visors and underwater effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vehicle-design&#34;&gt;Vehicle design &lt;a href=&#34;#vehicle-design&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Meddings and Mike Trim designed the vehicles. The gull-winged cars were originally built for &lt;em&gt;Doppelgänger&lt;/em&gt;. The blue SHADO Jeeps were built on Mini Moke chassis. Few original props and miniatures have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast&#34;&gt;Broadcast &lt;a href=&#34;#broadcast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters were unsure if &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; was for adults or children. In the UK, episodes were shown in the late afternoon and Saturday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews of &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; are mixed. Some praise the visuals, music, and costumes, while others criticize the writing and pacing. Some reviews note the series&amp;rsquo; mix of adult themes and science fiction elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aborted-second-series&#34;&gt;Aborted second series &lt;a href=&#34;#aborted-second-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITC commissioned a second series, &lt;em&gt;UFO 2&lt;/em&gt;, set entirely on the Moon. However, when ratings dropped, ITC cancelled the plans. Gerry Anderson then created &lt;em&gt;Space: 1999&lt;/em&gt; from the pre-production work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;merchandise&#34;&gt;Merchandise &lt;a href=&#34;#merchandise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

The list excludes specific characters and focuses on alien races and fictional creatures, including those appearing in spin-off series like &lt;em&gt;The Sarah Jane Adventures&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Class&lt;/em&gt;, but excludes antagonists original to those series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abzorbaloff is an alien creature from the planet Clom, known for absorbing living beings into its body through touch. It appeared in the episode &amp;ldquo;Love &amp;amp; Monsters&amp;rdquo; (2006). In this episode, an Abzorbalovian disguised as &amp;ldquo;Victor Kennedy&amp;rdquo; infiltrated a group called L.I.N.D.A. to gain knowledge from the Doctor. The Abzorbaloff was ultimately defeated when Elton Pope broke its cane, causing the Earth to absorb it. The creature was created by William Grantham, a nine-year-old who won a &lt;em&gt;Blue Peter&lt;/em&gt; contest. Comedian Peter Kay portrayed the Abzorbaloff on-screen. A short sequel, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The Genuine Article&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; features the Abzorbaloff&amp;rsquo;s father seeking revenge, directed and animated by Grantham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode &amp;ldquo;Partners in Crime&amp;rdquo; (2008). Originating from the lost breeding world Adipose 3, they rely on a drug formulated by &amp;ldquo;Miss Foster&amp;rdquo; to convert human fat into Adipose children through parthenogenesis. This process, if accelerated, can be fatal to the host. The Adipose abandoned Foster to hide their illegal activities. In an alternate timeline in &amp;ldquo;Turn Left&amp;rdquo; (2008), the Adipose incident in America resulted in over 60 million deaths. The Adipose were inspired by a plush toy owned by writer Russell T Davies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheetah People are feline humanoids resembling cheetahs who enjoy hunting humans, encountered in &lt;em&gt;Survival&lt;/em&gt; (1989). They were once humanoids who mutated after bonding with cat-like creatures known as Kitlings. The Master, stranded on their planet, attempts to use them to escape. The Seventh Doctor stops the Master, leaving him stranded. Writer Rona Munro was disappointed with the final version of the Cheetah People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article discusses various conspiracy theories surrounding Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), particularly the idea that governments, especially the United States government, are suppressing evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology. It also explores the evolution of these theories, their proponents, and their presence in popular culture and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the core concept of UFO conspiracy theories: governments concealing evidence of extraterrestrial involvement. It traces the origins of these theories back to pulp science fiction and the &amp;ldquo;lost continent&amp;rdquo; myths. The section highlights Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting as a catalyst for widespread UFO reports and the subsequent speculation about secret technologies. Donald Keyhoe is identified as a key figure in popularizing the idea of a government cover-up. The emergence of the &amp;ldquo;Men in Black&amp;rdquo; concept is also mentioned.

It highlights that scientists and skeptical organizations offer prosaic explanations, such as natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. The section also notes that beliefs surrounding UFOs have inspired new religions and that social scientists view the ongoing interest in UFOs as a form of modern folklore and mythology. Benjamin Radford&amp;rsquo;s argument against the feasibility of a long-term, international UFO cover-up is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the various conspiracy theories surrounding UFOs, focusing on the idea that governments, particularly the United States government, are suppressing evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology. It also touches upon the alleged communication or cooperation between world governments and extraterrestrials, as well as claims of government involvement in cattle mutilations and alien abductions. The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry is cited as stating that there is little to no evidence to support these theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a historical context for UFO conspiracy theories, tracing their origins to pulp science fiction and &amp;ldquo;lost continent&amp;rdquo; myths. It mentions Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting and the subsequent wave of UFO reports. Donald Keyhoe is credited with popularizing the idea of a government cover-up. The section also discusses the emergence of the &amp;ldquo;Men in Black&amp;rdquo; concept and the linking of UFOs to the Kennedy assassination. It notes the rise of theories involving malevolent aliens, alien abductions, and cattle mutilations in the 1980s, as well as Bill Moore&amp;rsquo;s confession of feeding fake evidence to UFO researchers. The popularity of UFO conspiracy theories in 1990s popular culture, with shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, is also mentioned. The section concludes by noting the renewed interest in UFO conspiracy theories following Leslie Kean&amp;rsquo;s stories about a 21st-century Pentagon UFO program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents the mainstream scientific perspective on UFOs. It acknowledges the cultural prominence of UFOs after World War II and the Space Age, and mentions government investigations like Project Blue Book and Project Condign. It highlights that these investigations have not confirmed claims of extraterrestrial intelligence or other unconventional hypotheses. The section emphasizes that scientists and skeptical organizations offer prosaic explanations for UFOs, attributing them to natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. It also notes that beliefs surrounding UFOs have inspired new religions and that social scientists view the ongoing interest in UFOs as a modern example of folklore and mythology. Benjamin Radford&amp;rsquo;s argument about the unlikelihood of a decades-long, international UFO cover-up is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subsection describes the aftermath of the flying disc craze, including Palmer&amp;rsquo;s argument that the flap was proof of Richard Sharpe Shaver&amp;rsquo;s claims. It quotes Shaver&amp;rsquo;s prediction that the truth behind the discs would remain a secret. The subsection also notes Palmer&amp;rsquo;s later admission that Shaver had spent eight years in a mental institution and Palmer&amp;rsquo;s linking of UFOs to the Kennedy assassination and Watergate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-coverage-in-the-1950s&#34;&gt;National Coverage in the 1950s &lt;a href=&#34;#national-coverage-in-the-1950s&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the first &amp;ldquo;alien bodies&amp;rdquo; conspiracy theory, which emerged with Frank Scully&amp;rsquo;s columns in &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; and his book &lt;em&gt;Behind the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;. It mentions Scully&amp;rsquo;s claims of dead extraterrestrial beings recovered from flying saucer crashes and the later revelation that Scully had been the victim of confidence artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;air-force-accounts&#34;&gt;Air Force Accounts &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-accounts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection covers the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s handling of UFO reports, including General John Samford&amp;rsquo;s press conference on the recent UFO sightings over the nation&amp;rsquo;s capital. It mentions the Robertson Panel&amp;rsquo;s recommendation of a public education campaign and the film &lt;em&gt;Unidentified Flying Objects: The True Story of Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;, which dramatized the events of the early 1950s.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1960-70s-growing-distrust-in-government&#34;&gt;1960-70s: Growing Distrust in Government &lt;a href=&#34;#1960-70s-growing-distrust-in-government&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the era of government skepticism that began in the 1960s, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Pentagon Papers, and the Watergate scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fred-crisman-and-jfk-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Fred Crisman and JFK Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#fred-crisman-and-jfk-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

It mentions Jim Garrison&amp;rsquo;s prosecution of Clay Shaw and Crisman&amp;rsquo;s testimony before the New Orleans grand jury. The subsection also notes the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations&amp;rsquo; consideration of the possibility that Crisman may have been one of the &amp;ldquo;three tramps&amp;rdquo; detained and photographed in the aftermath of the JFK assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosmic-watergate&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cosmic Watergate&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-watergate&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the concept of a &amp;ldquo;Cosmic Watergate,&amp;rdquo; which refers to the idea of a government cover-up of UFO information. It mentions the novel and film &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; and J. Allen Hynek&amp;rsquo;s claim that Bluebook was &amp;ldquo;a Cosmic Watergate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-bodies-at-hangar-18&#34;&gt;Alien Bodies at &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-bodies-at-hangar-18&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Perspectives on the alien abduction phenomenon</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_c0a6e9617f65/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_c0a6e9617f65/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;perspectives-on-the-alien-abduction-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Perspectives on the Alien Abduction Phenomenon &lt;a href=&#34;#perspectives-on-the-alien-abduction-phenomenon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explores various explanations for claims of alien abduction and examination by otherworldly beings. Perspectives range from complete disbelief to the acceptance of these claims as objective reality. Some researchers, like Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack, acknowledge an &amp;ldquo;authentic mystery&amp;rdquo; surrounding the phenomenon, urging consideration of all associated aspects, including missing time, UFO sightings, and occurrences in children. The mainstream scientific view leans towards a psychosocial explanation rooted in human psychology, neurology, and culture, while others, including conspiracy theorists and ufologists, believe in literal extraterrestrial abductions. Authors like Jacques Vallée and John E. Mack suggest the need to re-evaluate our understanding of reality to comprehend the phenomenon fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the idea that alien abduction is a real phenomenon where extraterrestrial beings abduct humans for study or experimentation. The elusiveness of these beings is attributed to their advanced technology. The hypothesis lacks widespread support among mainstream scientists due to the absence of physical evidence and the contradictory nature of abduction accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;literary-perspectives&#34;&gt;Literary Perspectives &lt;a href=&#34;#literary-perspectives&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the appeal of alien abduction accounts from a literary standpoint. Terry Matheson suggests that these tales are captivating due to their depiction of human powerlessness. The section contrasts the temporary fear experienced from ghost stories with the inescapable nature of alien abductions, which the abduction myth suggests cannot be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skeptical-perspectives&#34;&gt;Skeptical Perspectives &lt;a href=&#34;#skeptical-perspectives&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines skeptical explanations for alien abduction reports, focusing on psychological processes rather than extraterrestrial beings. Skeptics critically examine claims for evidence of hoaxes or influence from popular culture. Brian Dunning notes psychological explanations such as hallucination, temporary schizophrenia, epileptic seizures, and parasomnia (including hypnagogic states, night terrors, and sleep paralysis). Sleep paralysis, often accompanied by hallucinations, is presented as a potential explanation, although individuals experiencing it do not typically interpret it as alien encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hoax&#34;&gt;Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section addresses the possibility of alien abduction claims being hoaxes, motivated by financial gain or attention. While some skeptics believe abductees are lying, it is acknowledged that most abductees genuinely believe in their experiences, making simple fabrication an insufficient explanation for the majority of claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychopathology&#34;&gt;Psychopathology &lt;a href=&#34;#psychopathology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the view, once common but now largely unsupported by scientists, that those claiming alien abduction are mentally ill. Studies have found that alleged abductees are generally no more likely to suffer from psychopathologies than the general population. However, abductees often score higher in tests measuring hypnotic suggestibility, absorption, magical ideation, and dissociative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;false-memory-hypothesis&#34;&gt;False Memory Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#false-memory-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the false memory hypothesis, a widely accepted theory in the scientific community, which explains how psychologically healthy individuals may develop and maintain a belief in alien abduction through psychological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sleep-paralysis&#34;&gt;Sleep Paralysis &lt;a href=&#34;#sleep-paralysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details how sleep paralysis, often accompanied by feelings of chest pressure and hypnopompic hallucinations (such as flying, lights, presences, and figures), can contribute to abduction experiences. Cultural beliefs strongly influence the content of these hallucinations. Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s comparison of alien abduction experiences to historical tales of demon abduction is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lucid-dreams&#34;&gt;Lucid Dreams &lt;a href=&#34;#lucid-dreams&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the connection between lucid dreams and alien abduction experiences. Research from the Phase Research Center suggests that experiences of close encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials can be products of the human mind during lucid dreaming. A 2021 study found that a significant percentage of volunteers could emulate alien encounters via lucid dreams, with some experiencing sleep paralysis and fear similar to &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; abduction stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hypnosis&#34;&gt;Hypnosis &lt;a href=&#34;#hypnosis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the use of hypnosis in recovering memories of &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; in abduction cases, starting with the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. It notes that individuals interested in UFOs may seek therapists with similar beliefs, potentially leading to the creation of false memories under hypnosis due to increased suggestibility. Thomas Bullard notes that hypnotized subjects are more likely to confabulate or be open to memory implantation. Budd Hopkins&amp;rsquo; counterargument, citing the Hill case, is also presented. Skeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass suggest that individual abduction researchers influence the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cultural-impact&#34;&gt;Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the influence of cultural factors on abduction claims. Skeptics argue that variations in abduction details across cultures support a psycho-social hypothesis. The section notes that abduction accounts may be influenced by science fiction, citing the resemblance between the Betty and Barney Hill case and media they had recently consumed. It also mentions how abduction claims have changed over time to align with scientific discoveries about the solar system. Robert Sheaffer highlights differences in the types of aliens reported in different countries and similarities between aliens in early science fiction films and abduction reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;maintenance-of-abduction-memories&#34;&gt;Maintenance of Abduction Memories &lt;a href=&#34;#maintenance-of-abduction-memories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses how abductees maintain their beliefs, even when faced with disbelief. Many seek support groups where they find validation from others with similar experiences, reinforcing the accuracy of their abduction memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drug-induced-hallucinations&#34;&gt;Drug-Induced Hallucinations &lt;a href=&#34;#drug-induced-hallucinations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the possibility that some alleged abductions are drug-induced hallucinations. It mentions Terence McKenna&amp;rsquo;s experiences with &amp;ldquo;Machine Elves&amp;rdquo; while using DMT and Rick Strassman&amp;rsquo;s research at the University of New Mexico, which found that a significant percentage of volunteers injected with high doses of DMT had experiences similar to purported alien abductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parallels-with-other-phenomena&#34;&gt;Parallels with Other Phenomena &lt;a href=&#34;#parallels-with-other-phenomena&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section draws parallels between the abduction phenomenon and other unusual events, such as witchcraft claims. Robert Sheaffer notes similarities in imagery, uncovered memories, and sex, suggesting a common underlying psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section also notes Gwen Dean&amp;rsquo;s presentation of 44 parallels between alien abduction and satanic ritual abuse (SRA) at a 1992 MIT conference. Both phenomena emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, often use hypnosis, and feature similar elements such as familial involvement, generational occurrences, examination tables/altars, focus on genitals/sexuality/breeding, altered states of consciousness, and &amp;ldquo;missing time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents the view that abduction experiences share similarities with pre-20th century accounts of demonic manifestations. Writers have noted numerous similarities. Fr. Seraphim Rose, an Orthodox monk, dedicates a chapter in his book &lt;em&gt;Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future&lt;/em&gt; to UFOs and abductions, concluding that they are manifestations of the demonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series follows Philip J. Fry, a pizza delivery boy who is cryogenically preserved for 1,000 years and revived on December 31, 2999. Fry finds work at the interplanetary delivery company Planet Express, working alongside the one-eyed mutant Leela and the robot Bender. Groening envisioned the series in the mid-1990s while working on &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, and brought David X. Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; is set in New New York at the turn of the 31st century. The city of New New York has been built over the ruins of present-day New York City, which has become a catacomb-like space that acts as New New York&amp;rsquo;s sewer, referred to as &amp;ldquo;Old New York&amp;rdquo;. Parts of the sewers are inhabited by mutants. Various devices and architecture are similar to the Populuxe style. Global warming, inflexible bureaucracy, and substance abuse are a few of the subjects given a 31st-century exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox expressed a strong desire in the mid-1990s for Matt Groening to create a new series after the success of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;. In 1995, he enlisted David X. Cohen to assist in developing the show. When they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and story lines. Fox ordered thirteen episodes. Fox feared the themes of the show were not suitable for the network and Groening and Fox executives argued over whether the network would have any creative input into the show. The episode &amp;ldquo;I, Roommate&amp;rdquo; was produced to address Fox&amp;rsquo;s concerns. The name &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; comes from a pavilion at the 1939 New York World&amp;rsquo;s Fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing &lt;a href=&#34;#writing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning for each episode began with a table meeting of writers, who discussed the plot ideas as a group. A single staff writer wrote an outline and then produced a script. Once the first draft of a script was finished, the writers and executive producers called in the actors for a table read. After this script reading, the writers collaborated to rewrite the script as a group before sending it to the animation team. The writing staff held three Ph.D.s, seven master&amp;rsquo;s degrees, and cumulatively had more than 50 years at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;voice-actors&#34;&gt;Voice actors &lt;a href=&#34;#voice-actors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; had eight main cast members. Billy West performed the voices of Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Doctor Zoidberg, Zapp Brannigan, and many other incidental characters. Katey Sagal voiced Leela, and is the only member of the main cast to voice only one character. John DiMaggio performed the voice of the robot Bender Bending Rodríguez and other, more minor, characters. Phil LaMarr voices Hermes Conrad, his son Dwight, Ethan Bubblegum Tate, and Reverend Preacherbot. Lauren Tom voices Amy Wong, and Tress MacNeille voices Mom and various other characters. Maurice LaMarche voices Kif Kroker and several supporting characters. David Herman voiced Scruffy and various supporting characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;animation&#34;&gt;Animation &lt;a href=&#34;#animation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; is produced by The Curiosity Company and 20th Television Animation with the animation being done by Rough Draft Studios. In addition to traditional cartoon drawing, Rough Draft Studios often used CGI for fast or complex shots. The series began high-definition production in season 6, with &lt;em&gt;Bender&amp;rsquo;s Big Score&lt;/em&gt;. For the final episode of season 6, &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; was completely reanimated in three different styles: Fleischer- and Walter Lantz-style animation, a low-resolution video game, and Japanese anime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hallmarks&#34;&gt;Hallmarks &lt;a href=&#34;#hallmarks&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Planet Express Ship&lt;/em&gt; flies across the screen with the title of the show being spelled out in its wake. Underneath the title is a joke caption. After flying through downtown New New York and past various recurring characters, the Planet Express ship crashes through a large screen showing a short clip from a classic cartoon. The &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; theme was created by Christopher Tyng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;languages&#34;&gt;Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three alternative alphabets that appear often in the background of episodes. The first alphabet consists of abstract characters and is referred to as Alienese, a simple substitution cipher from the Latin alphabet. The second alphabet uses a more complex modular addition code. The third language sometimes used is Hebrew. The show predicts that several English expressions will have evolved by the year 3000&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of people reporting what they believe to be the real experience of being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. Those who claim to have been abducted are called &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; Most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject claims that alien abduction literally occurs as reported. Some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that most abductees are sane and common people, with psychopathology associated only with some cases. Mack noted the detailed nature of some abduction reports and the existence of a subculture with support groups and a mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, etc.). Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the term &amp;ldquo;alien abduction&amp;rdquo; gained widespread attention, some older stories were speculated to be possible cases, dubbed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1896, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them in Stockton, California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1953, an article in &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; questioned whether humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1955, Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported the mysterious disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, with speculation that they were victims of abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 generated widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident was the first in which the claimants described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s and suggested a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became interested in abduction reports in the 1970s and used hypnosis to extract more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980s brought mainstream attention to the subject through works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs, and psychiatrist John E. Mack. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard published a comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees. Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected and that aliens were attempting to create human-alien hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Skeptic Michael Shermer noted that the ubiquity of camera phones increases the burden of evidence for such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; called him &amp;ldquo;a well-meaning man uncritically elaborating on tales of alien abduction, and potentially both cementing and constructing false memories&amp;rdquo;. Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression of claimants helped spread the Grey aliens meme into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. Due to Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief and subsequent promotion of the claims of those he interviewed, his professional reputation suffered, prompting Harvard to review his position in 1994. He retained tenure, but &amp;ldquo;was not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population allege to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although abduction reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental Health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &amp;ldquo;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&amp;rdquo;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking&amp;rdquo;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &amp;ldquo;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Political Conspiracy Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#political-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism&amp;rdquo;. UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters but also featured demonization of FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering it important to warn the world of such imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS&amp;rsquo;s definition of &lt;em&gt;abductee&lt;/em&gt;, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; through means like hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although different cases vary in detail, some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp;amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time&lt;/strong&gt;. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany&lt;/strong&gt;. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience&amp;rdquo;, accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says: &amp;ldquo;The entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown&amp;rdquo; will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness &amp;ldquo;the Oz Factor&amp;rdquo;. External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings against environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, figures like psychiatrist John E. Mack have argued that many abductees are sane individuals reporting genuine experiences. A subculture has developed around the phenomenon, complete with support groups and a detailed mythos involving various alien types (Greys, Reptilians, Nordics) with specific roles and motivations. Some abductees explain the lack of wider awareness as a result of extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A November 27, 1896, report in &lt;em&gt;The Evening Mail&lt;/em&gt; of Stockton, California, where Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by tall, slender humanoids who tried to kidnap them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1953 &lt;em&gt;Man to Man Magazine&lt;/em&gt; article questioning if humans were being captured by flying saucers for zoological specimens or vivisection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s 1955 publication &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt;, which reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction by flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two Landmark Cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Antônio Vilas-Boas case in the mid-1950s was an early claim, but the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin. Skeptic Peter Rogerson notes that these cases established a template for later abductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later Developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the phenomenon in the 1960s and believed in its actuality, linking abductions to cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became a figurehead of the abductee subculture in the 1970s, using hypnosis to extract details. The 1980s brought mainstream attention through works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack, presenting alien abduction as plausible. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard also published a comparative analysis of alleged abductees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than suspected, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been taken. They proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids, with the most advanced stage known as hubrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of systematic interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer noted that camera phones increase the burden of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, criticized Mack for uncritically elaborating on abduction tales and potentially constructing false memories. Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression helped spread the Grey aliens meme. Despite his esteemed reputation, Mack&amp;rsquo;s belief in abduction claims led to a Harvard review in 1994, where he retained tenure but lost professional credibility among colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While abduction reports are usually made by adults, children sometimes report similar experiences with specific details in common with adult reports. These child reports often feature family members who have reported abduction experiences, and family involvement in the military or residence near a military base is also common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show no difference in psychopathology prevalence compared to the general population. Elizabeth Slater&amp;rsquo;s blind study found abductees prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking,&amp;rdquo; nightmares, and weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally&amp;rsquo;s study found no psychiatric illness in abductees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Michael Barkun highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, and government takeover. He observed the rise of &amp;ldquo;improvisional millenarism.&amp;rdquo; UFO and abduction stories can be part of stigmatized knowledge narratives, where alleged orthodoxy is claimed to be maintained for nefarious purposes. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barkun noted that popular culture, such as &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies and demonized FEMA. Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities and may resort to questionable regression therapy. Some espouse conspiracy theories of technological mind control, including implants, to force them to serve a New World Order or for the purposes of the antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abduction-narrative&#34;&gt;Abduction Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#abduction-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. CUFOS defines an abductee as someone taken against their will by non-human beings to an extraterrestrial place or spaceship, subjected to examination or communication, with memory of the experience either conscious or recovered through hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though cases vary, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argues there is a fairly consistent sequence of events in a typical &amp;ldquo;close encounter of the fourth kind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductee is rendered incapable of resisting and taken to an alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examination and Procedures:&lt;/strong&gt; Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and sometimes simulated behavioral situations, training, testing, or sexual liaisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals, typically telepathically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductees are given a tour of their captors&amp;rsquo; vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductees are returned to earth, sometimes in a different location or with new injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theophany:&lt;/strong&gt; Abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &amp;ldquo;high,&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;mystical experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath:&lt;/strong&gt; The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Jacobs says the entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated with predetermined procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the experience, such as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place or expectations of something &amp;ldquo;familiar yet unknown.&amp;rdquo; They also report severe anxiety. This period of foreboding can last for days or be absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the experiencer undergoes an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness, called &amp;ldquo;the Oz Factor&amp;rdquo; by British researchers. External sounds cease to have significance, and the experiencer feels introspective and calm. This marks a transition to &amp;ldquo;limited self-willed mobility.&amp;rdquo; Lights appear, sometimes accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the abduction proceeds, claimants say they walk or are levitated into an alien craft, sometimes through solid objects. Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light into the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. These procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge is often taller and of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John G. Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported by abductors, focusing on the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems like the cardiovascular and respiratory systems receive less attention. Abductors do not appear to wear gloves, and terrestrial medicine constants like pills and tongue depressors are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subsequent-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, abductees often report other procedures, including imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; involves viewing screens displaying images intended to provoke emotional responses. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is similar, but the images are projected into the experiencer&amp;rsquo;s mind. &amp;ldquo;Staging&amp;rdquo; involves the abductee playing an active role in a vivid, hallucination-like scenario. &amp;ldquo;Testing&amp;rdquo; involves the experiencer operating a complicated electronic device, often finding they know how to operate it despite initial confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;child-presentation&#34;&gt;Child Presentation &lt;a href=&#34;#child-presentation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abductees sometimes report being subjected&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-abduction&#34;&gt;Alien Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien abduction, also known as abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, is the subjective experience of individuals reporting being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. These individuals are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;abductees&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;experiencers.&amp;rdquo; While most scientists and mental health professionals attribute these experiences to factors like suggestibility, sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology, some researchers give credence to the claims. Typical claims involve forced medical examinations, often focusing on reproductive systems, warnings about environmental abuses and nuclear weapons, or interspecies breeding. The content of these narratives often varies with the abductee&amp;rsquo;s cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream scientists generally reject the literal interpretation of alien abduction claims. However, some, like psychiatrist John E. Mack, argue that many abductees are sane individuals, with psychopathology only present in some cases. Detailed abduction reports have led to the development of a subculture with support groups and a complex mythos explaining the roles, origins, and motivations of various alien types, such as Greys, Reptilians, and Nordics. Some abductees engage in independent research and attribute the lack of wider awareness to extraterrestrial or governmental cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-abductions&#34;&gt;Paleo-abductions &lt;a href=&#34;#paleo-abductions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the widespread attention to alien abduction in the 1960s, some older stories have been reinterpreted as possible early cases, termed &amp;ldquo;paleo-abductions&amp;rdquo; by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. One example is Colonel H. G. Shaw&amp;rsquo;s 1896 claim of being harassed by tall, slender humanoids. An article from 1953 asked if flying saucers were kidnapping humans for zoological specimens or vivisection. The 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; reported speculation that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who claimed alien contact, disappeared due to abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-landmark-cases&#34;&gt;Two landmark cases &lt;a href=&#34;#two-landmark-cases&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antônio Vilas-Boas case in Brazil during the mid-1950s was an early claim but received limited attention initially. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961 gained widespread publicity, including a 1975 television film. The Hill incident is considered a prototypical abduction case, possibly the first to describe beings later known as the Greys and explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;later-developments&#34;&gt;Later developments &lt;a href=&#34;#later-developments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, became interested in the phenomenon in the 1960s and linked abductions to cattle mutilation. Budd Hopkins became a key figure in the abductee subculture in the 1970s, using hypnosis to uncover details of remembered events. The 1980s saw increased mainstream attention, with works by Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs, and John E. Mack presenting alien abduction as a plausible experience. Thomas E. Bullard&amp;rsquo;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees was also published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was more common than previously thought, estimating tens of thousands of North Americans had been abducted. They also proposed an alien effort to create human-alien hybrids. While anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancies related to UFO encounters existed earlier, Hopkins and Jacobs popularized the idea of widespread interbreeding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, alien abduction stories have declined in mainstream media. Michael Shermer suggests that the ubiquity of camera phones has increased the burden of evidence, contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-e-mack&#34;&gt;John E. Mack &lt;a href=&#34;#john-e-mack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce, writing in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, suggested that Mack&amp;rsquo;s work in hypnotic regression helped spread the Grey aliens meme. Mack interviewed over 800 people and wrote two books on the subject. His professional reputation suffered due to his belief and promotion of abduction claims, leading to a Harvard review in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abductees&#34;&gt;Abductees &lt;a href=&#34;#abductees&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. Early studies found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys suggested 5–6 percent of the general population claim to have been abducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics &lt;a href=&#34;#demographics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While abduction reports are usually made by adults, children sometimes report similar experiences. These reports often share specific details with adult reports, including circumstances, narrative, entities, and aftermaths. Young abductees often have family members who have reported abduction experiences, and family involvement in the military or residence near a military base is also common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health&#34;&gt;Mental health &lt;a href=&#34;#mental-health&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that abductees are not different from the general population in terms of psychopathology prevalence. Elizabeth Slater&amp;rsquo;s blind study found abductees prone to &amp;ldquo;mildly paranoid thinking,&amp;rdquo; nightmares, and weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally&amp;rsquo;s study concluded that none of the abductees suffered from psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Barkun, TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters, and demonized FEMA. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &amp;ldquo;consensus reality&amp;rdquo; in favor of deviant alternative realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities and may resort to questionable regression therapy. Some espouse conspiracy theories of technological mind control, including implants, to force them to serve a New World Order or for the purposes of the antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;

They also report feeling severe anxiety. Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; into an altered state of consciousness.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination phase is characterized by medical procedures and examinations by alien beings against the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. The entity in charge of the operation is often taller than the others and may appear to be of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. The abductors&amp;rsquo; areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and joints. Systems given less attention include the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx, and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the &amp;ldquo;examination.&amp;rdquo; Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives, although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imaging&amp;rdquo; procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. &amp;ldquo;Envisioning&amp;rdquo; is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_9c34e91b7ea9/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_9c34e91b7ea9/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2024&#34;&gt;National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 &lt;a href=&#34;#national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (NDAA 2024) is a United States federal law that outlines the budget, expenditures, and policies of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for fiscal year 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Defense Authorization Act is an annual bill proposed in the United States Congress that redefines the United States military budget for the following fiscal year. Each chamber of Congress introduced a version of the NDAA: H.R. 2670 in the House and S. 2226 in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House passed their version on July 14, 2023 by a vote of 219–210. Led by Chuck Schumer and Mike Rounds, the Senate passed theirs on July 27, 2023 by a vote of 86–11. The Senate then replaced H.R. 2670 with the text of S. 2226 and passed it by unanimous consent, and indefinitely postponed S. 2226. The House disagreed to the Senate amendment and asked to hold conference on September 19, with the Senate insisting on its amendment and agreeing to conference on November 15. The subsequent conference report was filed on December 6 (H. Rept. 118-301). The bill was approved by the Senate and House and sent to President Joe Biden on December 14. Biden signed it into law on December 22. In his signing statement, Biden expressed reservations about provisions that restrict the executive branch&amp;rsquo;s discretion in Guantanamo detainee transfers and raised constitutional concerns regarding congressional oversight and foreign policy authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provisions&#34;&gt;Provisions &lt;a href=&#34;#provisions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section requires updating to reflect recent events or newly available information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-objects-ufos&#34;&gt;Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-objects-ufos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 1841 et seq. outline the creation and management of a comprehensive collection of government records on UFOs or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) at the National Archives (NARA), detailing the processes for assembling, preserving, and providing public access to these records, along with specific protocols for their review, disclosure, and secure handling. NARA subsequently provided guidance to federal agencies to identify, organize, and disclose UAP records for the new collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections 1687 and 7343 disallow use of funds or independent research and development (IRAD) indirect expenses for UFOs or UAP unless such material and information is made available the appropriate congressional committees and congressional leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language on the topic of UFO/UAP was also included in the previous 2023 NDAA, the 2022 NDAA, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, as well as an accompanying Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report for the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foreign-extortion-prevention-act&#34;&gt;Foreign Extortion Prevention Act &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-extortion-prevention-act&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Extortion Prevention Act (FEPA) enables US authorities to prosecute foreign officials who demand or accept bribes from a US citizen, US company, or within a US jurisdiction. FEPA addresses a longstanding gap in US anti-bribery legislation by tackling the &amp;ldquo;demand&amp;rdquo; side of bribery. At the same time, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) focuses on the &amp;ldquo;supply&amp;rdquo; side of bribery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;counter-extremist-working-group-defunded&#34;&gt;Counter-extremist working group defunded &lt;a href=&#34;#counter-extremist-working-group-defunded&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans opposed the anti-extremism working group created by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. That working group had been created by Austin after it became apparent that some service members and veterans had participated in the attack on the US Capitol January 6, 2021. That working group released recommendations at the end of 2021. Implementation, however, appeared to stall as Republicans increasingly opposed diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the military, which Republicans derided as &amp;ldquo;wokeness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a recent inspector general report found dozens of troops, who appeared to be advocating violent overthrow of the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seriousness of this issue seems apparent from the fact that military and veterans have participated in other violent extremist events. For example, the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, had served with distinction in Operation Desert Storm but had earned a reputation as a sergeant for assigning undesirable work to black servicemen and using derogatory language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 1250A prevents the President from withdrawing the United States from NATO without the approval of a two-thirds Senate supermajority or an act of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;original-proposals&#34;&gt;Original proposals &lt;a href=&#34;#original-proposals&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original House bill contained provisions to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Force Personnel Management Act: Disestablish the regular Space Force in order to integrate both active duty and reserve personnel into one Space Force entity. This is to allow for better flexibility for the Space Force by replacing &amp;ldquo;active duty&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;sustained duty&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;full-time&amp;rdquo; status, and replacing &amp;ldquo;reserve&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;part-time&amp;rdquo; status. This change would only pertain to the Space Force and not to the other armed services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevate the position of vice chief of the National Guard Bureau to hold a statutory rank of general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permanently establish the titles of commissioned officer ranks of the Space Force to be the same as the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorize a $886 billion spending budget for national defense programs including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 5.2% pay increase for service members of the armed forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procurement of up to 13 &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;-class submarines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorize the sale and transfer of defense articles and services relating to the implementation of the AUKUS partnership, including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to three &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;-class submarines, one year after this act is passed, however the Navy doesn&amp;rsquo;t intend implement this until 2032.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate amendment contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP Disclosure Act: The Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act of 2023 would direct the National Archives and Records Administration to collect and disclose records on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) no later than 25 years after enactment with a presumption of immediate disclosure. The U.S. president can certify that continued postponement can be made necessary by an identifiable harm to military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations. The federal government would have eminent domain over recovered technologies of unknown origin (TUO) and biological evidence of non-human intelligence (NHI) that may be controlled by private persons or entities, such as aerospace companies. Legislation was necessary in part because UAP records had not been subject to mandatory declassification review due to exemptions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as well as an over-broad interpretation of &amp;ldquo;transclassified foreign nuclear information&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) requires people currently or formerly under contract with the federal government to make all UFO/UAP material and information and a comprehensive list of all extraterrestrial or exotic UAP material available to the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A provision that prevents the President of the United States from withdrawing the U.S. from NATO without approval of a two-thirds Senate supermajority or an act of Congress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufology&#34;&gt;Ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufology is the investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) by individuals who believe they may have extraordinary origins, often extraterrestrial. While governments, private groups, and fringe science have investigated UFOs, ufology is generally considered pseudoscience by skeptics and science educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology &lt;a href=&#34;#etymology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;ufology&amp;rdquo; is a neologism derived from &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; and the suffix &amp;ldquo;-logy.&amp;rdquo; Edward J. Ruppelt is credited with coining the term UFO. Early uses of &amp;ldquo;ufology&amp;rdquo; appeared in a 1957 &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Universe&lt;/em&gt; article and a 1958 presentation for The Planetary Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-background&#34;&gt;Historical background &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufology&amp;rsquo;s roots trace back to various historical phenomena, including the mystery airships of the late 1890s, foo fighters reported during World War II, ghost fliers of the 1930s, ghost rockets of 1946 in Scandinavia, and the Kenneth Arnold sighting in 1947. The Arnold sighting popularized the concept of flying saucers. Increased UFO publicity after World War II coincided with Cold War tensions and concerns about Soviet aircraft. Official government involvement in ufology in the United States ended after the Condon Committee report and the termination of Project Blue Book. France maintains the GEIPAN program for UFO studies. In September 2023, NASA appointed Mark McInerney as the first Director of U.A.P. to study such occurrences scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;as-a-field&#34;&gt;As a field &lt;a href=&#34;#as-a-field&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufology is not recognized as a scientific field by academia and is generally considered pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;status-as-a-pseudoscience&#34;&gt;Status as a pseudoscience &lt;a href=&#34;#status-as-a-pseudoscience&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufology is often listed as a pseudoscience due to its lack of adherence to the scientific method, supporting evidence, plausibility, and falsifiability. Social factors contribute to this status, including mistrust between ufology, the sciences, and government bodies. Poor science communication regarding the extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) hypothesis hinders public understanding and discourages academic inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-interest&#34;&gt;Current interest &lt;a href=&#34;#current-interest&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomer Avi Loeb launched The Galileo Project in 2021 to collect scientific evidence of extraterrestrial technology. The University of Würzburg is developing sensors for detecting and analyzing aerial objects. A 2021 Gallup poll indicated increased belief among Americans that some UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft. In 2022, NASA announced a study to investigate UAP. In 2023, the RAND Corporation published a study reviewing public reports of UAP sightings in the United States from 1998 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;methodological-issues&#34;&gt;Methodological issues &lt;a href=&#34;#methodological-issues&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific UFO research faces challenges due to the unpredictable nature of UFO phenomena, their lack of reproducibility, and tangible physicality. Most UFO sightings have mundane explanations, limiting the interpretive power of extraordinary events. Carl Sagan noted that reliable cases are uninteresting, and interesting cases are unreliable. J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallée developed descriptive systems for characterizing UFO sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phenomena-linked-to-ufology&#34;&gt;Phenomena linked to ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#phenomena-linked-to-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufologists are interested in phenomena related to UFO sightings, including crop circles, cattle mutilations, anomalous materials, alien abductions, and implants. Some ufologists promote UFO conspiracy theories, such as the Roswell Incident and the Majestic 12 documents. Robert Sheaffer has accused ufology of a &amp;ldquo;credulity explosion,&amp;rdquo; and James E. McDonald identified &amp;ldquo;cultism&amp;rdquo; as negatively impacting ufology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-posadism&#34;&gt;In Posadism &lt;a href=&#34;#in-posadism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, ufology was combined with the ideas of the Trotskyist Posadism movement in South America. Juan Posadas, the main theorist, believed humanity should appeal to extraterrestrials to collaborate in suppressing poverty and creating a socialist system on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;governmental-and-private-ufology-studies&#34;&gt;Governmental and private ufology studies &lt;a href=&#34;#governmental-and-private-ufology-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1940s, governmental agencies and private groups have sponsored UFO investigations, studies, and conferences. These include Project Sign, Project Magnet, Project Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, and the Condon Committee in the United States; the Flying Saucer Working Party and Project Condign in Britain; GEIPAN in France; and Project Hessdalen in Norway. Private studies include those by the RAND Corporation, Harvey Rutledge, and the National Press Club&amp;rsquo;s Disclosure Project. The United Nations sponsored meetings and hearings on UFO sightings from 1977 to 1979. In August 2020, the United States Department of Defense established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous private organizations worldwide are dedicated to the study and discussion of ufology. Skeptic organizations emphasize the pseudoscientific nature of ufology. During World UFO Day (July 2), ufologists raise public awareness of ufology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ufology&amp;rsquo;s roots can be traced to several historical phenomena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mystery Airships (late 1890s):&lt;/strong&gt; Unexplained aerial objects reported during this period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foo Fighters (World War II):&lt;/strong&gt; Reports from Allied airmen of unusual objects during flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost Fliers (1930s):&lt;/strong&gt; Sightings in Europe and North America.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost Rockets (1946):&lt;/strong&gt; Sightings in Scandinavia, particularly Sweden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Arnold Sighting (1947):&lt;/strong&gt; Arnold&amp;rsquo;s report of &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; popularized the concept.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-nation&#34;&gt;Alien Nation &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-nation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; is an American science fiction media franchise created by Rockne S. O&amp;rsquo;Bannon, known for &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt;. The franchise, owned by 20th Century Studios, encompasses film, television, novels, and comics centered around alien refugees living on Earth. It blends science fiction with elements of drama, police procedural, and buddy cop genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting&#34;&gt;Setting &lt;a href=&#34;#setting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise is set in the near future in the United States, specifically starting in 1991. A flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert, revealing the Tenctonese, an extraterrestrial race referred to as &amp;ldquo;Newcomers.&amp;rdquo; These aliens are escaping slavery from a cruel Overseer race. The Tenctonese resemble humans but possess anatomical differences and enhanced physical and intellectual capabilities due to selective breeding. The core concept revolves around the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration into American society, exploring themes of multiculturalism and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;film&#34;&gt;Film &lt;a href=&#34;#film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise began with the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;, released by 20th Century Fox. The film depicts the integration of the Tenctonese refugees, or Newcomers, into human society in Los Angeles. It combines science fiction and police drama elements. The film stars Mandy Patinkin as Sam &amp;ldquo;George&amp;rdquo; Francisco, a Newcomer detective in the Los Angeles Police Department, and James Caan as Matthew Sykes, his initially reluctant human partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television&#34;&gt;Television &lt;a href=&#34;#television&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Fox adapted the film into a television series, also called &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The series follows the same premise as the film, focusing on the Newcomers&amp;rsquo; integration after their ship crashes on Earth. Eric Pierpoint stars as George Francisco, and Gary Graham as Matthew Sikes. The series explores themes of racism and the treatment of minority ethnic groups. The series ran for one season of 21 episodes and a pilot episode, ending in 1990. Fox abruptly cancelled the series after the season. Beginning in 1994, the network continued the story in five TV movies, which brought back the entire cast. The installments include &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; (1994), &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt; (1995), &lt;em&gt;Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996), &lt;em&gt;The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; (1996), and &lt;em&gt;The Udara Legacy&lt;/em&gt; (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novels&#34;&gt;Novels &lt;a href=&#34;#novels&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pocket Books, a division of Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, published a novel series connected to the franchise starting in 1993. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, known for their work in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, wrote a novel entitled &lt;em&gt;Day of Descent&lt;/em&gt;. Some novels served as prequels to the movie sequels, such as K.W. Jeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Cross of Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a tie-in to the &lt;em&gt;Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; film, and Peter David&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt;, which became one of the sequels of the same name. The novels regularly addressed racism and discrimination with extraterrestrial themes. K. W. Jeter and Barry B. Longyear were regular contributors to the series with novels like, &lt;em&gt;The Change&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slag Like Me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comics&#34;&gt;Comics &lt;a href=&#34;#comics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 1992, Malibu Comics published several comics adapting the &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt; storyline. Among the first released titles were &lt;em&gt;The Spartans&lt;/em&gt;, created with the help of author Bill Spangler and illustrator James Tucker, and &lt;em&gt;A Breed Apart&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Steve Jones. Other titles included &lt;em&gt;Public Enemy&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Sandy Carruthers and illustrated by Lowell Cunningham, and a crossover series with the &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; franchise titled &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Ape Nation&lt;/em&gt; series included four different adventures called &lt;em&gt;Plans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pasts&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pawns&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pains&lt;/em&gt; along with a collector&amp;rsquo;s edition. Other contributors to the series included illustrators Terry Pallott and Leonard Kirk to titles like, &lt;em&gt;The Skin Trade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;remake&#34;&gt;Remake &lt;a href=&#34;#remake&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 25, 2015, Fox announced a remake with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing. On September 9, 2016, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported that Jeff Nichols would write and direct the film. On January 25, 2021, it was announced that Jeff Nichols would remake the film as a ten-part television series. On June 21, 2024, it was reported Nichols was developing an original sci-fi feature film for Paramount instead of an Alien Nation project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;spacecraft&#34;&gt;Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to fly and operate in outer space. It serves various purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transporting humans and cargo. Spacecraft typically require a launch vehicle to reach space, except for single-stage-to-orbit vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of spacecraft begins with the German V-2 rocket, which reached an altitude of 189 km in June 1944 in Peenemünde, Germany. Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, was the first artificial satellite, marking the start of the Space Age. Sputnik 1&amp;rsquo;s launch initiated new political, military, technological, and scientific developments. It also helped identify the density of the upper atmospheric layer and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. While Sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth, other human-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100 km, the Kármán line, which is the height required by the international organization Fédération Aéronautique Internationale to count as a spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crewed-and-uncrewed-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Crewed and Uncrewed Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#crewed-and-uncrewed-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacecraft are categorized into crewed and uncrewed vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crewed-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Crewed Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#crewed-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2016, only Russia, the United States, and China have flown crewed spacecraft. Vostok 1, carrying Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in 1961, was the first crewed spacecraft to complete a full Earth orbit. The second crewed spacecraft was &lt;em&gt;Freedom 7&lt;/em&gt;, which performed a sub-orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying American astronaut Alan Shepard. Other crewed spacecraft include the Soviet Voskhod and Soyuz, the American Gemini and Apollo spacecraft, the Skylab space station, the Space Shuttle, and the Chinese Shenzhou. The International Space Station (ISS), crewed since November 2000, is a joint venture between Russia, the United States, Canada, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uncrewed-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Uncrewed Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#uncrewed-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed spacecraft operate autonomously or telerobotically, often preferred for cost-effectiveness and lower risk. They are used for missions unsuitable for humans, such as exploring Venus or the outer planets. Robotic spacecraft used for scientific research are space probes, while those orbiting a planetary body are artificial satellites. Examples include the Hubble Space Telescope and cargo spacecraft like the Jules Verne Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other&#34;&gt;Other &lt;a href=&#34;#other&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some spacecraft, like the Buran spaceplane and SpaceX Dragon 2, can operate as both crewed and uncrewed vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Types of Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacecraft are designed for various specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communications-satellite&#34;&gt;Communications Satellite &lt;a href=&#34;#communications-satellite&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications satellites relay and amplify radio telecommunication signals between a source transmitter and a receiver on Earth. They are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. Many are in geostationary orbit, while others form satellite constellations in low Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cargo-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Cargo Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#cargo-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo spacecraft are robotic vehicles designed to carry cargo, such as food, propellant, and other supplies, to support space station operations. Automated cargo spacecraft have serviced Salyut 6, Salyut 7, Mir, the International Space Station, and Tiangong space station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-probes&#34;&gt;Space Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#space-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space probes are robotic spacecraft sent to explore deep space or astronomical bodies other than Earth. They have visited every planet in the Solar System and Pluto. The Voyager probes, launched in 1977, took advantage of a rare alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to visit all four planets in one mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;voyager-program&#34;&gt;Voyager Program &lt;a href=&#34;#voyager-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voyager probes, launched in 1977, took advantage of a rare planetary alignment to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are now escaping the Solar System, providing valuable data from interstellar space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-telescopes&#34;&gt;Space Telescopes &lt;a href=&#34;#space-telescopes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space telescopes are telescopes in outer space used to observe astronomical objects, avoiding the filtering and distortion of electromagnetic radiation and light pollution. Examples include the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;landers&#34;&gt;Landers &lt;a href=&#34;#landers&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landers are spacecraft that make a soft landing on the surface of an astronomical body other than Earth. They use various techniques, including fuel supply and aerobraking, to achieve a safe landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-capsules&#34;&gt;Space Capsules &lt;a href=&#34;#space-capsules&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space capsules are spacecraft that can return from space at least once. They have a blunt shape and do not possess wings. The Vostok capsule, built by the Soviet Union, carried the first person in space, Yuri Gagarin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spaceplanes&#34;&gt;Spaceplanes &lt;a href=&#34;#spaceplanes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaceplanes are spacecraft built in the shape of airplanes. The North American X-15 was an early example, while the Space Shuttle orbiter was the first reusable orbital spaceplane. The Buran-class shuttle, launched by the USSR, was the first autonomous reusable spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;space-shuttle&#34;&gt;Space Shuttle &lt;a href=&#34;#space-shuttle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Space Shuttle was a reusable Low Earth Orbital launch system consisting of two reusable Solid Rocket Boosters, a Space Shuttle Orbiter, and a throwaway Space Shuttle external tank. It flew 135 times from 1981 to 2011, supporting Mir, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-1&#34;&gt;Other &lt;a href=&#34;#other-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some spacecraft do not fit neatly into the general categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;spacex-starship&#34;&gt;SpaceX Starship &lt;a href=&#34;#spacex-starship&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship is a spacecraft and second stage under development by SpaceX, designed to transport crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond. It will also be capable of point-to-point transport on Earth and refueling other Starship vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mission-extension-vehicle&#34;&gt;Mission Extension Vehicle &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-extension-vehicle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mission Extension Vehicle is a robotic spacecraft designed to prolong the life of another spacecraft by docking to it and correcting its orientation or orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subsystems&#34;&gt;Subsystems &lt;a href=&#34;#subsystems&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spacecraft&amp;rsquo;s astrionics system comprises various subsystems, including attitude determination and control, guidance, navigation and control, communications, command and data handling, power, thermal control, propulsion, and structures. Spacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include a life support system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacecraft-records&#34;&gt;Spacecraft Records &lt;a href=&#34;#spacecraft-records&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;et-the-extra-terrestrial-1982-film&#34;&gt;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#et-the-extra-terrestrial-1982-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive overview of the 1982 American science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison. The film tells the story of a boy, Elliott, who befriends an extraterrestrial stranded on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A race of alien botanists visits Earth, but one of them gets separated from the group and is left behind. The alien takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Elliott lures the alien back to his home with Reese&amp;rsquo;s Pieces, and he hides the creature in his room. Elliott introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and five-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep E.T. hidden from their mother, Mary. Elliott and the creature begin to bond, they start to share thoughts and emotions. E.T. displays telekinetic abilities and revives a dead chrysanthemum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because E.T. is drinking beer and watching television at home. Inspired by a Buck Rogers comic strip, E.T. builds a makeshift device to &amp;ldquo;phone home&amp;rdquo;, using various parts around the Taylor home. On Halloween, the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks E.T. into the forest, where they set up the device to call E.T.&amp;rsquo;s people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the next day. He returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding him pale and weakened in a culvert. He takes E.T. home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveal the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott&amp;rsquo;s help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T&amp;rsquo;s arrival a genuine miracle. However, E.T. dies while Elliott rapidly recovers. Left alone to say goodbye, Elliott tells E.T. that he loves him, but E.T.&amp;rsquo;s heart begins to glow and he is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that his people are returning for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael&amp;rsquo;s friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.&amp;rsquo;s ship arrives, and he says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gifts him the chrysanthemum he previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but E.T. places his glowing finger on Elliott&amp;rsquo;s head and tells him that he will always be there. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as the ship blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main cast includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dee Wallace as Mary Taylor, the single mother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Henry Thomas as Elliott Taylor, the boy who befriends E.T.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter Coyote as Keys, the government agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert MacNaughton as Michael Taylor, Elliott&amp;rsquo;s older brother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drew Barrymore as Gertie Taylor, Elliott&amp;rsquo;s younger sister.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cast members include K.C. Martel, Sean Frye, C. Thomas Howell, Erika Eleniak, David O&amp;rsquo;Dell, Richard Swingler, Frank Toth, Robert Barton, Michael Darrell, and Pat Welsh as the voice of E.T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;rsquo;s concept originated from an imaginary friend Steven Spielberg created after his parents&amp;rsquo; divorce. He initially planned a darker project called &lt;em&gt;Night Skies&lt;/em&gt; but developed a subplot into what became &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; Melissa Mathison wrote the first draft, titled &lt;em&gt;E.T. and Me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-production&#34;&gt;Pre-production &lt;a href=&#34;#pre-production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlo Rambaldi designed the animatronics for E.T., inspired by his painting &lt;em&gt;Women of Delta&lt;/em&gt; and the faces of Carl Sandburg, Albert Einstein, and Ernest Hemingway. Kathleen Kennedy visited the Jules Stein Eye Institute to study eyes for E.T. Four heads were created for filming, one as the main animatronic and the others for facial expressions, as well as a costume. Tamara De Treaux, Pat Bilon, and Matthew DeMeritt took turns wearing the costume. Mars, Incorporated refused to allow M&amp;amp;M&amp;rsquo;s to be used in the film, so The Hershey Company was asked if Reese&amp;rsquo;s Pieces could be used, and it agreed. Henry Feinberg created E.T.&amp;rsquo;s communicator device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;casting&#34;&gt;Casting &lt;a href=&#34;#casting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spielberg cast Henry Thomas as Elliott after an impressive improvised audition scene. Robert MacNaughton played Michael, and Drew Barrymore was cast as Gertie. Pat Welsh provided the major voice work for E.T., with additional sounds from Debra Winger, Spielberg, and various animals. A scene featuring Harrison Ford as the school principal was cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal photography began on September 8, 1981, in Los Angeles County and the San Fernando Valley, under the cover name &lt;em&gt;A Boy&amp;rsquo;s Life&lt;/em&gt;. Filming locations included Culver City High School, Northridge, Tujunga, Laird International Studios in Culver City, and a redwood forest near Crescent City in Northern California. The exterior Halloween scene and the &amp;ldquo;flying bicycle&amp;rdquo; chase scenes were filmed in Porter Ranch. The film was shot in roughly chronological order to achieve convincing emotional performances from the young cast. Sean Frye revealed how the visual effect close-up shots for the climax of the &amp;ldquo;flying bicycle&amp;rdquo; chase scene were filmed. BMX riders Robert Cardoza, Greg Maes, and David Lee served as stunt doubles for the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Williams composed the score, taking a modernist approach with polytonality and the Lydian mode. Spielberg edited the final chase sequence to suit Williams&amp;rsquo; music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film explores themes of divorce, alienation, growing up, and communication. Critics have noted parallels between E.T. and Elliott, as well as religious parallels between E.T. and Jesus. Some see the movie as a modern fairy tale, drawing comparisons to Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz. Kathleen Kennedy highlighted tolerance as an important theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; premiered at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. It opened at number one at the US box office and stayed at the top for six weeks. In 1983, &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; surpassed &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to become the highest-grossing film of all time. The film was also a merchandising success, with dolls selling 15 million units by September 1982 and becoming the best-selling toy that Christmas season. The film was re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60 million and $68 million respectively. It was re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, to commemorate the film&amp;rsquo;s 40th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 27, 1988. The videos were priced with a recommended retail price of $24.95, the lowest initial price at the time for a major movie compared to the normal price of $89.95. The film doubled the record pre-orders of &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt; released the same month and went on to sell over 15 million VHS units in the United States, and grossed over $250 million in video sales revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film received near-universal acclaim. Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars, and Michael Sragow of &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; called Spielberg &amp;ldquo;a space age Jean Renoir.&amp;rdquo; George Will was one of few to pan the film. The film holds a 99% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;area-51&#34;&gt;Area 51 &lt;a href=&#34;#area-51&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area 51, officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, is a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It&amp;rsquo;s administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While details of its operations are not public, it&amp;rsquo;s generally believed to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF and CIA acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it a frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore. The CIA publicly acknowledged the base&amp;rsquo;s existence in 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. It&amp;rsquo;s located in southern Nevada, approximately 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography &lt;a href=&#34;#geography&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the physical location and surrounding areas of Area 51. The original base was a 6 by 10 mile rectangle, part of the larger &amp;ldquo;Groom box,&amp;rdquo; a 23 by 25 mile area of restricted airspace. It&amp;rsquo;s connected to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with roads leading to Mercury and Yucca Flat. Groom Lake Road runs northeast through the Jumbled Hills, past a security checkpoint, and eventually connects to State Route 375, the &amp;ldquo;Extraterrestrial Highway,&amp;rdquo; south of Rachel, Nevada. Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, where many US nuclear tests were conducted. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is southwest of Groom Lake. Groom Lake itself is a salt flat used for runways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the name &amp;ldquo;Area 51&amp;rdquo; is uncertain. The CIA refers to the facility as Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake. Other nicknames include &amp;ldquo;Dreamland&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; The special use airspace is Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N). Lead and silver were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864, and mining operations occurred until the early 1950s. The airfield began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-2-program&#34;&gt;U-2 program &lt;a href=&#34;#u-2-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA established the Groom Lake test facility in April 1955 for Project AQUATONE, the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Project director Richard M. Bissell Jr. sought a secure testing site. Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s Kelly Johnson found Groom Lake ideal due to the dry lake bed and surrounding mountain ranges. The CIA acquired the land from the AEC, designating it &amp;ldquo;Area 51.&amp;rdquo; Johnson named the area &amp;ldquo;Paradise Ranch.&amp;rdquo; A survey team arrived in May 1955, laying out a runway and base support facility. The Ranch initially consisted of shelters, workshops, and trailer homes. By July 1955, the base had a paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and accommodations for personnel. The first U-2 delivery arrived on July 24, 1955. Regular flights were established between Area 51 and Lockheed&amp;rsquo;s Burbank offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oxcart-program&#34;&gt;OXCART program &lt;a href=&#34;#oxcart-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project OXCART was established in August 1959 for work on the Lockheed A-12. Groom Lake&amp;rsquo;s facilities were initially inadequate. Construction of &amp;ldquo;Project 51&amp;rdquo; began in September 1960, including a new 8,500 ft runway. Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) upgraded base facilities. A 10,000 ft runway (14/32) was built, and an Archimedean spiral was marked on the dry lake as an overrun. Three Navy hangars were erected, and the original U-2 hangars were converted to maintenance shops. Facilities included workshops, storage, administration buildings, a commissary, a control tower, a fire station, and housing. A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed for the JP-7 fuel required by the A-12. Security was enhanced, and the FAA expanded the restricted airspace. The CIA facility received USAF F-101 Voodoos, T-33 Shooting Star trainers, a C-130 Hercules, a U-3A, a helicopter, a Cessna 180, and an F-104 Starfighter. The first A-12 test aircraft arrived in February 1962 and made its first flight on April 26, 1962. By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA-operated &amp;ldquo;1129th Special Activities Squadron&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;d-21-tagboard&#34;&gt;D-21 Tagboard &lt;a href=&#34;#d-21-tagboard&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of Gary Powers&amp;rsquo; U-2, discussions arose about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. The Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962, designated &amp;ldquo;Q-12,&amp;rdquo; later renamed the &amp;ldquo;D-21.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Tagboard&amp;rdquo; was the project&amp;rsquo;s code name. The D-21 was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the &amp;ldquo;M-21.&amp;rdquo; Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965. The first D-21 launch was made on March 5, 1966, with a successful flight. An accident on July 30, 1966, caused the D-21 to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft, resulting in one crew member drowning. Kelly Johnson cancelled the program. The Air Force proposed launching them from a B-52H bomber. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. The D-21B program was cancelled on July 15, 1971. The remaining drones were transferred to the Davis-Monthan AFB Military Storage and Disposition Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foreign-technology-evaluation&#34;&gt;Foreign technology evaluation &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-technology-evaluation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the United States tested and evaluated captured Soviet fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, Area 51 hosted Soviet-built aircraft. Munir Redfa&amp;rsquo;s defection with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 led to the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate their performance and capabilities, pitting them against U.S. fighters. In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in late 1967 for study. In 1968, the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT. Comparisons between the F-4 and the MiG-21 indicated that the skill of the pilot was what made the difference. On August 12, 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel with a pair of MiG-17Fs. These MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers. The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed Top Gun school at NAS Miramar. In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed, and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport. Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. In 2017, a USAF aircraft crashed at the site, killing the pilot, Lt. Colonel Eric &amp;ldquo;Doc&amp;rdquo; Schultz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-bluef-117-program&#34;&gt;Have Blue/F-117 program &lt;a href=&#34;#have-bluef-117-program&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter first flew at Groom in December 1977. In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Development Projects. On January 17, 1981, the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full-scale development (FSD) prototype, designated YF-117A. On June 18, 1981, Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A off the runway of Area 51. Tactical Air Command (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability, the 4450th Tactical Group, which officially activated on October 15, 1979, at Nellis AFB, Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. The 4450th TG also operated the A-7D Corsair II as a surrogate trainer for the F-117A. On October 15, 1982, Major Alton C. Whitley Jr. became the&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;psychological-perspectives-on-ufo-belief&#34;&gt;Psychological Perspectives on UFO Belief &lt;a href=&#34;#psychological-perspectives-on-ufo-belief&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of sighting, visitation, and contact with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been the subject of medical and psychological research. Some research suggests psychopathological origins for these claims, while others propose that &amp;ldquo;experiencers&amp;rdquo; may simply have overactive imaginations. Treatment approaches include antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-a-mental-health-disorder&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as a Mental Health Disorder &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-a-mental-health-disorder&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the idea that belief in UFOs and extraterrestrial contact may be linked to underlying mental health conditions. It highlights research suggesting that individuals claiming face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials (ETs) may have distinct psychological profiles compared to those without such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research &lt;a href=&#34;#research&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies are presented that explore the potential link between UFO beliefs and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1983 study in the &lt;em&gt;Canadian Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; examined six individuals claiming extraterrestrial contact and concluded that five suffered from a paranoid delusional state akin to paraphrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1997 study by researchers at the University of Essex found an association between UFO-related beliefs and schizotypy, a construct that may indicate a risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2008 study published in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals alleging alien abduction showed higher levels of dissociativity and a tendency to hallucinate compared to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;individual-experiencers&#34;&gt;Individual Experiencers &lt;a href=&#34;#individual-experiencers&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents case studies of individuals whose belief in alien encounters was linked to mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2000 case study at Boston University Medical Center described a married couple with shared psychotic disorder involving a belief in alien abductions. The husband had a history of mental health issues and suicide attempts, and the couple&amp;rsquo;s shared delusion reinforced their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2008 case at the University of Louisville involved a woman with sleep paralysis who believed she was being abducted by aliens. Her belief was attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the paralysis and cultural acclimation to the alien abduction phenomenon. Psychotherapy improved her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 case study from Nova Southeastern University reported on a 17-year-old boy who felt &amp;ldquo;as if he is being chased by Martians.&amp;rdquo; He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with risperidone, cognitive behavioral therapy, and counseling to stop using marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-a-personality-trait&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as a Personality Trait &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-a-personality-trait&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the idea that belief in UFOs may be related to certain personality traits, particularly fantasy-prone personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons with a fantasy-prone personality spend a significant portion of their lives involved in fantasy and may confuse or mix their fantasies with their real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew suggests that some individuals are prone to exceptionally vivid fantasies and have difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality. Science journalist Eric Smalley hypothesizes that &amp;ldquo;starseeds&amp;rdquo; may be experiencing the Barnum effect, with books providing a sense of authenticity to their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology professor Robert Baker proposed fantasy-prone personality as an explanation for UFO contacts, noting that individuals reporting such contacts are not necessarily psychotic or neurotic, just &amp;ldquo;a little different.&amp;rdquo; Armando Simon, a staff psychologist at the Texas Department of Corrections, argued that belief in UFOs is a cultural norm in North America and not necessarily a sign of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1991 study of 152 individuals reporting alien abductions found that 132 exhibited characteristics consistent with fantasy-prone personality. A 2001 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of UFO and Abduction Studies&lt;/em&gt; found that persons who reported seeing UFOs tended &amp;ldquo;to have a richer fantasy life than those who do not report UFOs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-belief-as-faulty-perceptuality&#34;&gt;UFO Belief as Faulty Perceptuality &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-belief-as-faulty-perceptuality&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines how cognitive and perception psychology can explain UFO beliefs, focusing on how human perception, cognitive biases, and psychological tendencies shape beliefs about UAP stimuli. Joey Florez explored UAPs through comparative institutional psychology, focusing on the intuitive and conspiratorial mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florez explains that understanding flawed perception entails considering anomalous phenomena from antiquity, given the over-reliance on superstition and illogical assumptions about the external world. Ancient Greeks interpreted bright flashes in the sky as Zeus firing lightning bolts, reinforcing divine authority and political legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two central modes of information processing, intuitive and conspiratorial, can be used to identify modern UAP beliefs from a cognitive and perceptual perspective. Primary experiences with UAP stimuli often involve intuitive processing, while secondary experiences often involve conspiratorial processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pareidolia refers to anomalies in the brain&amp;rsquo;s initial perception of recognizable patterns in ambiguous visual stimuli, while apophenia is intentional and results in complex convictions of conspiratorial narratives. Research has suggested cognitive reflection and education may reduce narcissistic susceptibility to conspiratorial processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-studies-and-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other Studies and Hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-studies-and-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents additional research and perspectives on UFO belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1993 study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Abnormal Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found no difference in psychopathology and fantasy proneness between persons alleging abduction by UFOs and those with more mundane UFO experiences, concluding that UFO belief did not have a psychopathological origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in 2017 in &lt;em&gt;Motivation and Emotion&lt;/em&gt; found that paranormal beliefs related to extraterrestrial life were partly motivated by the need for meaning in life, with persons experiencing a lack of life meaning demonstrating a higher propensity for such beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard University psychiatrist John E. Mack suggested that some patients related actual encounters with non-humans or non-human controlled UFOs that were not explainable as mental illness. However, a Harvard review committee concluded that Mack was not using &amp;ldquo;rational and scholarly&amp;rdquo; research methods. Mack&amp;rsquo;s use of hypnosis to elicit purportedly repressed memories of abduction experiences has also been criticized. UCLA psychiatrist Fred Frankel and Michael D. Yapko criticized Mack&amp;rsquo;s use of hypnosis, explaining that fantasy and suggestion play a major role during hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien Autopsy  Fact or Fiction (1995 film)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_f41f4fadf611/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:35:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-autopsy-fact-or-fiction-1995-film&#34;&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction (1995 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy-fact-or-fiction-1995-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry discusses the 1995 pseudo-documentary &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which featured footage purporting to show an alien autopsy conducted after the Roswell incident. The footage, released by British entrepreneur Ray Santilli, was broadcast on television networks worldwide, including Fox television, hosted by Jonathan Frakes, and Channel 4 in the UK. Despite its popularity, the program was thoroughly debunked, with the footage revealed to have been shot on a set in London using plaster casts filled with offal and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the production of the hoaxed footage. In 2006, Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield admitted to creating the 1995 footage in a documentary presented by Eamonn Holmes. They simulated an autopsy on a fabricated alien, constructed by artist and sculptor John Humphreys in a London flat. Humphreys created two dummy alien bodies filled with raspberry jam, sheep brains, and chicken entrails. Alien artifacts were also fabricated. Santilli and Shoefield also admitted to hiring a homeless man in Los Angeles to play the role of the original cameraman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines how &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; was received and referenced in media. &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; satirized the footage, and Fox later aired a special debunking it. A fictionalized version of the creation of the footage was retold in the comedy film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>List of UFO religions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_c138a4063c7d/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO religions are groups that incorporate beliefs about communication with extraterrestrial beings into their religious doctrines. These groups often interpret major religions as being based on supernatural beings from heaven. Communication methods include telepathy and astral projection. A common belief is that humanity can be saved through education provided by aliens, leading to societal improvement. Alien abduction experiences can also contribute to the formation of these religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for understanding UFO religions. It highlights that these religions generally involve belief in communication with extraterrestrial beings, often through physical contact, telepathy, or astral projection. These groups typically believe that aliens will save humanity by teaching them a better way to live, sometimes by taking believers to a more positive location. UFO religions emphasize spiritual growth and the evolution of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Gordon Melton is identified as considering the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; Activity, founded by Guy Ballard, as the first UFO religion. However, Christopher Hugh Partridge views it as a theosophical religion rather than a UFO religion. Partridge emphasizes the belief within UFO religions that supreme beings originate from other planets or planes, not from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident of 1947 is identified as a key event in the history of UFO spirituality, marking the emergence of UFOs into public consciousness. UFO religion is placed within the context of theosophical esotericism and New Age thought, with many groups believing that extraterrestrial beings are heralds of a new era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, is described as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults. Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate and the Order of the Solar Temple are mentioned as controversial groups combining UFO beliefs with contactee assertions. Scientology is also discussed as a UFO religion due to its Xenu cosmogony and space opera elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;list&#34;&gt;List &lt;a href=&#34;#list&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cattle-mutilation&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilation &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle (and other animals) under unusual and often bloodless circumstances. The phenomenon is often linked to paranormal or supernatural explanations, including cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. Mutilations typically involve the removal of specific body parts such as ears, eyeballs, jaw flesh, tongues, lymph nodes, genitals, and rectums. Two independent federal investigations in the United States have been conducted into these incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-history&#34;&gt;Early History &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documented reports of unexplained livestock deaths date back to 1606 in England, with sheep being slaughtered and only tallow and inward parts removed. Charles Fort collected accounts of cattle mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; Horse Death of 1967 &lt;a href=&#34;#the-snippy-horse-death-of-1967&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of &amp;ldquo;Snippy,&amp;rdquo; a horse found mutilated in Alamosa, Colorado, in 1967, brought widespread attention to unexplained livestock deaths. The horse&amp;rsquo;s head and neck were skinned and defleshed, with precise cuts and no blood at the scene. Agnes King and her son Harry discovered the body. The incident fueled speculation about extraterrestrial involvement. Wadsworth Ayer&amp;rsquo;s investigation for the Condon Committee found no evidence of abnormal causes. Sheriff Ben Phillips initially suggested a lightning strike. Later, two students confessed to shooting the horse weeks after the publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilations 1973–1980 &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This period saw waves of cattle mutilations reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico. In April 1973, sheriffs in Western Iowa reported unidentified helicopters involved in cattle and pig rustling. Similar rustling was reported in Missouri in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1973-kansas-wave&#34;&gt;1973 Kansas Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1973-kansas-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about a caller posing as a USDA official. A series of butchered cows were found on farms near Munden, Kansas, with right ears removed. Local press speculated about a &amp;ldquo;Mad Dog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;phantom&amp;rdquo; Butcher. By December, law enforcement reported 40 mutilations across Kansas and Nebraska, with sexual organs removed. State Senator Ross Doyen reported a mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&amp;rsquo;s office attributed most deaths to natural causes, a conclusion disputed by Modlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1974-nebraska-wave&#34;&gt;1974 Nebraska Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1974-nebraska-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports resumed in April 1974 with a mutilated and blood-drained cow in Nebraska. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations and helicopter sightings. In May, mutilations were reported in Mills County, Iowa, with coyotes suggested as the cause. By June, mutilations were reported in Lancaster County, Nebraska. Custer County reported helicopter sightings and armed patrols. In August, an unidentified helicopter was spotted hovering above a field where a mutilated cow was later found near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported armed civilian patrols. Cloud County Attorney William Walsh suggested devil-worshiping cultists were responsible. State Sen. John Decamp called for a coordinated investigation. By late August, 25 mutilations were reported across five Nebraska counties. In September, authorities ordered helicopters to fly above 1000 feet after a commercial helicopter was shot at. A meeting of law enforcement officials from 24 counties estimated 27 out of 80 cow deaths were suspected mutilations. South Dakota Attorney General Kermit Sande reported mutilations in his state. UFO expert J. Allen Hynek denied any link between UFOs and mutilations. In December 1974, mutilations were reported in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1975-colorado&#34;&gt;1975 Colorado &lt;a href=&#34;#1975-colorado&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&amp;rsquo;s top story. Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI, claiming 130 mutilations in Colorado and reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing $1 million in damages. Donald E. Flickinger of the Michigan ATF investigated possible links to a &amp;ldquo;Hell-oriented biker gang.&amp;rdquo; The Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under Carl Whiteside. The New York Times published a story examining cattle mutilations across 11 states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34;&gt;1976 Dulce, New Mexico &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-dulce-new-mexico&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1979-public-meeting&#34;&gt;1979 Public Meeting &lt;a href=&#34;#1979-public-meeting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. Paul Bennewitz reported seeing unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. In May 1979, Valdez reported finding tranquilizers and anticoagulants in a mutilated bull. In June 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with radar chaff nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-incidents&#34;&gt;Later Incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#later-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since 1967, chiefly in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, photographic evidence surfaced of a mutilated human corpse found near the Guarapiranga reservoir of São Paulo, Brazil, in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unusual cattle deaths are characterized by the absence of sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, rectum, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts are described as &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;surgical.&amp;rdquo; Some animals are reported to have been drained of blood with no sign of blood in the immediate area. Howard Burgess stated that nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. Strange marks or imprints near the site have been found. In the &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; case, there was an absence of tracks and several small holes were found seemingly &amp;ldquo;punched&amp;rdquo; in the ground. In Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, a &amp;ldquo;trail of suction cup-like impressions&amp;rdquo; was found leading from a mutilated cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;laboratory-reports&#34;&gt;Laboratory Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#laboratory-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory reports on some mutilated animals have shown unusual levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples, and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. In a case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI involving a bull belonging to Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, the animal displayed &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; mutilation signs. The animal&amp;rsquo;s heart, bone, and muscle samples were sent to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, while liver samples were sent to private laboratories. The liver was found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain 4 times the normal level of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Blood samples were reported to be &amp;ldquo;light pink in color&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Did not clot after several days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;helicopter-sightings&#34;&gt;Helicopter Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#helicopter-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters were reported to have opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. in Honey Creek, Iowa. On August 20, 1974, the &lt;em&gt;Lincoln Journal Star&lt;/em&gt; reported that residents had seen unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft resembling a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-investigations&#34;&gt;Official Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#official-investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Mexico Livestock Board sought assistance from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents went undercover to investigate. Oklahoma convened a task force. Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34;&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms &lt;a href=&#34;#bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1975, the Minnesota field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) launched an investigation headed by Agent Donald Flickinger, tasked with investigating possible connections between cults and cattle mutilation. Flickinger recorded unusual incidents and circumstantial evidence but found insufficient evidence of cult involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34;&gt;Colorado Bureau of Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#colorado-bureau-of-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under the leadership of Carl Whiteside. 19 animals underwent necropsies at Colorado State University but no conclusive results emerged. The US Bureau of Land Management was forced to ground all helicopters in Eastern Colorado. By December, the CBI had investigated 203 reports of cattle mutilations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-mexico-state-police&#34;&gt;New Mexico State Police &lt;a href=&#34;#new-mexico-state-police&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 1976, the New Mexico State Police began an investigation headed by Officer Gabe Valdez with the assistance of Cattle Inspector Jim Dyad and Officer Howard Johnston of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish. On the night of July 5, Burgess and Valdez screened the Gomez herd; five animals were found to have been marked with a chemical that fluoresced under ultraviolet light. On June 14, 1981, intact radar chaff was found near a mutilated cow on the Gomez ranch. This investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant prior to their mutilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rommel-investigation&#34;&gt;Rommel Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#rommel-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in May 1979, an investigation was funded by a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and was headed by recently-retired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel. Rommel&amp;rsquo;s final report, released in June 1980, concluded that&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cattle-mutilation&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilation &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cattle mutilation refers to the killing and mutilation of cattle and other animals under unusual and often bloodless circumstances. The phenomenon has been linked to paranormal and supernatural explanations, as well as more mundane causes. Mutilations typically involve the removal of organs such as the eyes, tongue, and genitals. Reports of such incidents span the globe, involving various livestock and wild animals. Explanations range from natural decomposition and predation to cults, government agencies, cryptids like the chupacabra, and extraterrestrials. The United States has conducted two federal investigations into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-history&#34;&gt;Early History &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documented reports of unexplained livestock deaths date back to 1606 in England, where sheep were found slaughtered with only tallow and some inward parts removed. Charles Fort collected accounts of similar mutilations in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unexplained death and mutilation of a horse named &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; in Alamosa, Colorado, in 1967 brought the phenomenon to wider attention. The &lt;em&gt;Pueblo Chieftain&lt;/em&gt; published a story about the incident, detailing the horse&amp;rsquo;s skinned and defleshed head and neck, as well as precise cuts on the body. The lack of blood and a medicinal odor at the scene fueled speculation about extraterrestrial involvement. Wadsworth Ayer&amp;rsquo;s investigation for the Condon Committee concluded there was no evidence of abnormal causes. Sheriff Ben Phillips initially attributed the death to a lightning strike. Later, two students confessed to shooting the horse weeks after the incident gained publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34;&gt;Cattle Mutilations 1973–1980 &lt;a href=&#34;#cattle-mutilations-19731980&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This period saw a surge in reported cattle mutilations across Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico. Unidentified helicopters were reported in connection with cattle and pig rustling in Western Iowa (April 1973) and Missouri (August 1973).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1973-kansas-wave&#34;&gt;1973 Kansas Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1973-kansas-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about suspicious phone calls from someone posing as a USDA official. Several butchered cows were subsequently found in the county, with right ears removed. Local press speculated about a &amp;ldquo;Mad Dog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;phantom&amp;rdquo; butcher. By December, law enforcement reported a wave of cattle deaths in seven counties across Kansas and Nebraska, with sexual organs removed. State Senator Ross Doyen reported a mutilation on his ranch. The Kansas Brand Commissioner&amp;rsquo;s office attributed most deaths to natural causes, a conclusion disputed by Modlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1974-nebraska-wave&#34;&gt;1974 Nebraska Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#1974-nebraska-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports continued in April 1974 with a mutilated and blood-drained cow in Nebraska. The North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations and helicopter sightings. Mutilations were reported in Mills County, Iowa, with coyotes blamed. By June, Lancaster County, Nebraska, reported mutilations. Custer County reported helicopter sightings and armed patrols. In August, an unidentified helicopter was spotted shining a spotlight over a field where a mutilated cow was later found near Agnew, Nebraska. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported armed civilian patrols due to helicopter sightings. Cloud County Attorney William Walsh suggested devil-worshiping cultists were responsible. State Sen. John Decamp called for a coordinated investigation. By late August, 25 mutilations were reported across five Nebraska counties. A rancher near Hartington apparently thwarted a mutilation in progress when a helicopter was spotted above his field. Authorities cautioned against shooting at aircraft. In September, an autopsy revealed a supposedly-mutilated cow died of bacterial infection. Over 50 law enforcement officials attended a meeting in Center, Nebraska, estimating 27 out of 80 cow deaths were suspected mutilations. South Dakota also reported alleged mutilations. &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; became the first national outlet to cover the story, reporting 100 cattle mutilated in Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa since May. South Dakota Attorney General Kermit Sande confirmed mutilation reports in the state. UFO expert J. Allen Hynek denied any link between UFOs and mutilations. Minnesota reported mutilations in Kandiyohi, Swift, and Meeker counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1975-colorado&#34;&gt;1975 Colorado &lt;a href=&#34;#1975-colorado&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1979-public-meeting&#34;&gt;1979 Public Meeting &lt;a href=&#34;#1979-public-meeting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations, attended by about 80 people. Paul Bennewitz reported seeing unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base. In May, Valdez reported finding two drugs in a mutilated bull&amp;rsquo;s remains: Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) to tranquilize the animal and another to clog the blood. In June 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with radar chaff nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-incidents&#34;&gt;Later Incidents &lt;a href=&#34;#later-incidents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many mutilation cases have been reported worldwide since 1967, primarily in the Americas and Australia. South America has seen an estimated 3,500 incidents since 2002. Investigators believe many cases go unreported. In 1993, photographic evidence surfaced of a mutilated human corpse found near the Guarapiranga reservoir of São Paulo, Brazil, in 1988. Theories ranged from homicide to alien abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cattle deaths due to natural causes are common. However, ranchers began reporting unusual deaths characterized by missing sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, and sometimes ears or eyes. Cuts were described as &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;surgical.&amp;rdquo; Some animals were reported drained of blood with no blood at the scene. Howard Burgess noted that nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old. Strange marks or imprints have been found near mutilation sites. The &amp;ldquo;Snippy&amp;rdquo; case featured an absence of tracks and small holes &amp;ldquo;punched&amp;rdquo; in the ground. In Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, a &amp;ldquo;trail of suction cup-like impressions&amp;rdquo; was found leading from a mutilated cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;laboratory-reports&#34;&gt;Laboratory Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#laboratory-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory reports on some mutilated animals have shown unusual levels of vitamins or minerals and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. However, these anomalies are not consistent across all cases. In a case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI involving a bull belonging to Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, the animal displayed &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; mutilation signs. The liver and heart were white and mushy, with the texture of peanut butter. Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory detected &lt;em&gt;Clostridium&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in the heart but could not draw conclusions. Liver samples were devoid of copper and contained high levels of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Blood samples were light pink and did not clot. The animal&amp;rsquo;s hide was brittle, and the flesh was discolored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;helicopter-sightings&#34;&gt;Helicopter Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#helicopter-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters reportedly opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. in Honey Creek, Iowa. This followed a series of alleged mutilations in the area. In August 1974, residents reported seeing unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. Know County Sheriff Herbert Thompson claimed helicopter sightings were nightly occurrences. By 1975, some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups. Authorities ran ads urging ranchers not to shoot at survey helicopters. The National Guard warned its helicopter pilots to fly at higher altitudes. In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter. After this encounter, cattle mutilations in the region ceased for about five years. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft resembling a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-investigations&#34;&gt;Official Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#official-investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 1975, the Minnesota field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) launched an investigation headed by Agent Donald Flickinger, tasked with investigating possible connections between cults and cattle mutilation. Flickinger recorded unusual incidents and circumstantial evidence but found insufficient evidence of cult involvement. His investigation was dropped when it was determined cattle deaths were not a prelude to a coordinated campaign against elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;contact-1997-film&#34;&gt;Contact (1997 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#contact-1997-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a 1997 American science fiction drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 novel of the same name. The film stars Jodie Foster as Dr. Eleanor Arroway, a SETI scientist who discovers evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ellie Arroway, driven by the childhood loss of her father and inspired by his encouragement of her amateur radio hobby, dedicates her life to SETI research at the Arecibo Observatory. Facing funding cuts led by President&amp;rsquo;s science advisor David Drumlin, she secures private funding from the reclusive billionaire S.R. Hadden to continue her work at the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years later, Arroway discovers a signal from the star Vega containing a sequence of prime numbers. The discovery leads to a global effort to decode the message, which is complicated by Drumlin and the National Security Council&amp;rsquo;s attempts to control the facility. The signal is found to contain a video of Adolf Hitler&amp;rsquo;s opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics, the first Earth transmission strong enough to reach Vega.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroway&amp;rsquo;s team decodes the signal, revealing schematics for a complex machine designed to transport a single person. Multiple nations collaborate to fund the machine&amp;rsquo;s construction at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. An international panel is formed to select a candidate for the journey. Arroway is a leading contender, but her atheism, highlighted by panel member Palmer Joss, jeopardizes her selection. Drumlin is chosen, but a religious terrorist destroys the machine during testing, killing Drumlin and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadden, now terminally ill and living on the Mir space station, informs Arroway of a second, secretly constructed machine in Hokkaido, Japan. Arroway is selected to use it. Equipped with recording devices, she enters the pod and travels through wormholes, observing alien structures and a celestial event. She finds herself on a beach resembling a childhood drawing of Pensacola, Florida, and encounters an alien taking the form of her deceased father, who explains that the aliens have been monitoring humanity&amp;rsquo;s radio emissions and have deemed them ready for first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroway awakens in the pod, which has only fallen a short distance into a safety net. Mission control insists that the experiment achieved nothing, and her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee, led by Michael Kitz, investigates the possibility of a hoax orchestrated by Hadden, who has since died. Arroway asks the committee to accept her testimony on faith, emphasizing the profound impact of her experience. Kitz and Rachel Constantine, a White House official, acknowledge that Arroway&amp;rsquo;s device recorded 18 hours of static. Arroway receives continued funding for SETI research at the VLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film features a cast of notable actors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jodie Foster as Dr. Eleanor &amp;ldquo;Ellie&amp;rdquo; Ann Arroway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jena Malone as young Ellie&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan conceived &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; in 1979 with Lynda Obst and Peter Guber at Casablanca FilmWorks. Sagan and Ann Druyan completed the film treatment in 1980, aiming to depict a realistic first contact scenario. Kip Thorne consulted on wormhole travel. The character of Ellie Arroway was not directly inspired by Jill Tarter, though Foster met her for research. The name Ellie was inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project faced numerous rewrites and stalled development. Sagan rewrote &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; as a novel, published in 1985. Roland Joffé and George Miller were initially attached to direct but later departed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Zemeckis took over as director, securing artistic control. Filming began in September 1996 and concluded in February 1997. Key locations included the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, Warner Hollywood Studios, and Culver Studios. CNN news personalities were scripted into the film to enhance realism. Second unit filming took place at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Fiji, Saint John, US Virgin Islands, and Newfoundland, Canada. Technical consultants from the SETI Institute, Caltech, and a former White House staff member were involved. Sagan participated in the production until his death in December 1996, and the film is dedicated to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-effects&#34;&gt;Visual effects &lt;a href=&#34;#visual-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight VFX companies, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Weta Digital, and Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic, collaborated on the visual effects. Weta Digital designed the wormhole sequence. Digital alterations were made to news footage of Bill Clinton. Digital color correction addressed continuity issues during location shooting. The opening scene is a five-minute CGI sequence depicting a zoom out from Earth to the distant universe. The mirror shot was created through three different plates and manipulated in CGI. The machine was designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a design he created as a &amp;ldquo;time-displacement device&amp;rdquo; for an unused scene in &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Silvestri composed and conducted the original score. A soundtrack album was released in August 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores the cultural conflicts between religion and science, particularly concerning the existence of God. The film presents various viewpoints on faith and scientific evidence. It depicts intense public debate about the implications of alien contact, including questions about morality and the role of science. The film raises questions about the authenticity of Arroway&amp;rsquo;s journey, leaving room for doubt. The film suggests that science and religion can coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s release in July 1997 boosted interest in Sagan&amp;rsquo;s novel. The book appeared on &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best Seller list. The film premiered on July 1, 1997, and was released in the United States and Canada on July 11, 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film received generally positive reviews. Critics praised its exploration of scientific and theological concepts but noted weaknesses in storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;awards&#34;&gt;Awards &lt;a href=&#34;#awards&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and two Saturn Awards. It received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Sound and a Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Jodie Foster).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film used digitally altered footage of President Bill Clinton, leading to a protest from the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cnn&#34;&gt;CNN &lt;a href=&#34;#cnn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN chairman Tom Johnson expressed regret over allowing CNN staff to appear in the film, citing concerns about blurring the lines between news and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nasa&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director George Miller unsuccessfully sued Warner Bros. over breach of contract policies. Francis Ford Coppola sued Warner Bros. and Sagan, claiming that Sagan&amp;rsquo;s novel was based on a story they had developed together. Coppola&amp;rsquo;s claim was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alienoid-2022-film&#34;&gt;Alienoid (2022 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alienoid-2022-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2022 South Korean science fiction action film directed by Choi Dong-hoon, starring Ryu Jun-yeol, Kim Woo-bin, and Kim Tae-ri. The film involves time travel between the Goryeo era and the present day, with the appearance of aliens. It was released in IMAX and 4DX formats. A sequel, &lt;em&gt;Alienoid: Return to the Future&lt;/em&gt;, was released in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot alternates between the modern day and the Goryeo era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prologue-1380-ad&#34;&gt;Prologue: 1380 A.D. &lt;a href=&#34;#prologue-1380-ad&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monk warriors fail to defeat an alien and its human host. Guard and Thunder, humanoid robots from the future, extract the alien. The dying host asks Guard to care for her baby, but Guard initially refuses due to non-interference policies. Thunder smuggles the infant back with them to the modern day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline-1-2012-2022-ad&#34;&gt;Timeline 1: 2012-2022 A.D. &lt;a href=&#34;#timeline-1-2012-2022-ad&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard raises the baby girl, Yi-an, without revealing his true identity. Yi-an becomes suspicious and discovers the truth about Guard, Thunder, and her origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yi-an finds her way to Jisan Hospital, the site of an incoming alien prisoner transport. Guard and Thunder explain alien imprisonment mechanics. A prisoner-aligned alien ship arrives, planning to awaken the Controller and release haava to transform Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, awakening all alien prisoners and poisoning humanity. The pilot awakens the Controller and releases haava, devastating the city and awakening other prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard, Thunder, and Yi-an kill the alien pilot and prevent further haava release. Badly wounded, Yi-an travels back in time with the aliens, intending to strand them in the past. Guard is destroyed, Thunder sinks in a river, and the Controller is forced to abandon its host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline-2-1391-ad&#34;&gt;Timeline 2: 1391 A.D. &lt;a href=&#34;#timeline-2-1391-ad&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years after Thunder crash-lands, a Taoist bounty hunter named Mureuk pursues the Divine Blade (Guard&amp;rsquo;s power source). Mureuk meets martial arts figures like the Monk Guru, the Dual Mages, and Dogturd. He also meets Yi-an (the &amp;ldquo;Girl Who Shoots Thunder&amp;rdquo;) and Suiter and Ja-jang, aliens from the future who have taken over a local cult. The Divine Blade and Thunder&amp;rsquo;s location are key to controlling the haava release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chaotic battle ensues. Yi-an lures one alien away, while the other is defeated. Yi-an approaches Thunder&amp;rsquo;s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monk Guru, the Dual Mages, and Dogturd were all near the initial alien crash and are potential hosts for the Controller. However, Mureuk, Monk Guru&amp;rsquo;s apprentice, rescued Yi-an and became the Controller&amp;rsquo;s new host, losing his memories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and large, black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoids with grey skin, elongated bodies, small chests, and a lack of muscular definition. They are said to lack external human body parts like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their most striking feature is their disproportionately large heads with no hair and large, opaque, black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appearance&#34;&gt;Appearance &lt;a href=&#34;#appearance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection further elaborates on the physical appearance of Grey aliens. They are generally depicted as lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from humans. The most prominent feature is their large, black, almond-shaped eyes, often described as lacking eye whites. They are also frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explains the origin of the connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system. The association began with Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and determined that the aliens&amp;rsquo; home was Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype. It notes that descriptions of beings similar to Greys predate alien encounter claims, citing H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; descriptions of future humans in &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; (1893) and the Eloi in &amp;ldquo;The Time Machine&amp;rdquo; (1895).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the literary and occult origins of the Grey alien concept. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; depictions of future humans and the Eloi are mentioned as early examples of beings with Grey-like characteristics. Aleister Crowley&amp;rsquo;s 1917 encounter with a &amp;ldquo;preternatural entity&amp;rdquo; named Lam, described as similar to a modern Grey, is also discussed. Gustav Sandgren&amp;rsquo;s 1933 science fiction novel, &lt;em&gt;Den okända faran&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;), which describes a race of extraterrestrials with grey skin, bald heads, and large eyes, is identified as a key influence on the modern image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection focuses on the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case and its role in popularizing the Grey alien archetype. The Hills claimed that in 1961, they were abducted by grayish-skinned humanoid beings and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s 1990 article suggests that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which featured an alien with large eyes. Carl Sagan echoed these suspicions, citing &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as another potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses how Grey aliens became an integral part of ufology and extraterrestrial-related folklore after the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter. Journalist C.D.B. Bryan notes that 73% of reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. The section also mentions the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, and claims that individuals saw the U.S. military handling child-sized beings with oversized heads and slanted eyes. Whitley Strieber&amp;rsquo;s 1987 book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, which described his alleged encounters with Greys, is also discussed. Jimmy Guieu&amp;rsquo;s 1988 interview on TF1&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ciel, mon mardi!&lt;/em&gt; introduced the term &amp;ldquo;the little greys&amp;rdquo; to the French public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section further notes that Greys have become the subject of many conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of a government disinformation campaign or a product of mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s 1995 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to depict the autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines various analyses and interpretations of the Grey alien phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34;&gt;In close encounter claims and ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-close-encounter-claims-and-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection analyzes the role of Greys in alien abduction claims. It notes that Greys make up a significant percentage of reported alien encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focus of abduction claims, with abductees reporting that the Greys stare into their eyes during mental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents neurologist Steven Novella&amp;rsquo;s theory that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with their distinctive features representing traits associated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mother-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mother-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses Frederick V. Malmstrom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Mother Hypothesis,&amp;rdquo; which suggests that Greys are residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom argues that the face of a Grey can be reconstructed through transformation of a mother&amp;rsquo;s face based on early-childhood sensation and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolutionary-implausibility&#34;&gt;Evolutionary implausibility &lt;a href=&#34;#evolutionary-implausibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s argument that the typical image of a Grey is too physiologically similar to a human to be a credible representation of an alien from a different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-hypotheses&#34;&gt;Other hypotheses &lt;a href=&#34;#other-hypotheses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection briefly mentions alternative explanations for the humanoid anatomy and behavior of alleged Grey aliens, including the interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the depiction of Grey aliens in popular culture. It notes that Greys have become a common way to depict extraterrestrials in fiction, supplanting the &amp;ldquo;little green men&amp;rdquo; archetype. Examples include Ultraman (1966), &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;. The section also mentions the increasing association of Greys with conspiracy theories in the 1990s, citing &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; as a prominent example. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The films &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; (2011) and &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; (2013) are also mentioned, as well as the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; (2021) and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt; (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;grey-aliens&#34;&gt;Grey Aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#grey-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens, also known as Zeta Reticulians, Roswell Greys, or simply Greys, are alleged extraterrestrial beings frequently featured in close encounter and alien abduction claims. They are typically depicted as small humanoids with grey skin, large heads, and black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 is credited with popularizing the image of Grey aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the typical physical characteristics attributed to Grey aliens. They are described as diminutive humanoid beings with grey skin, lacking external human features like noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are elongated with small chests, lacking muscular definition, and having disproportionately short legs. A key feature is their large heads relative to their bodies, devoid of hair, with small orifices for ears, nostrils, and mouths. Their eyes are large, opaque, black, and almond-shaped. They are often described as shorter than average adult humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34;&gt;Association with Zeta Reticuli &lt;a href=&#34;#association-with-zeta-reticuli&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between Grey aliens and the Zeta Reticuli star system stems from Marjorie Fish&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of a star map drawn by Betty Hill in 1969. Hill, under hypnosis, claimed the map showed the aliens&amp;rsquo; home system. Fish created a model based on Hill&amp;rsquo;s drawing and identified the stars as Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the origins and evolution of the Grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of beings resembling Grey aliens predate reported encounters. H.G. Wells described future humans with similar features in his 1893 article &amp;ldquo;The Man of the Year Million&amp;rdquo; and his 1895 novel &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;. In 1917, Aleister Crowley described an entity named Lam with a similar appearance. In 1933, Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, writing as Gabriel Linde, described aliens with grey clothes, bald heads, and large eyes in his science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Danger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barney and Betty Hill abduction case in 1961 brought the Grey alien archetype to public attention in 1965. The Hills claimed they were abducted by grey-skinned humanoids and taken aboard a flying saucer. Martin Kottmeyer suggested Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories, revealed under hypnosis, may have been influenced by an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; which aired shortly before Barney&amp;rsquo;s first hypnotic session. Carl Sagan also suggested &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt; as a potential inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffusion-into-folklore&#34;&gt;Diffusion into folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#diffusion-into-folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Hill&amp;rsquo;s encounter, Greys became a central figure in ufology and extraterrestrial folklore, particularly in the United States, where they account for 73% of reported alien encounters. The alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, was later linked to Greys. In 1987, Whitley Strieber published &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;, a book detailing his alleged encounters with Greys, which became a bestseller and was adapted into a film. In 1988, Jimmy Guieu introduced the term &amp;ldquo;les Petits-Gris&amp;rdquo; (little greys) to French audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greys have become the subject of conspiracy theories, with some theorists believing they are part of government disinformation campaigns or mind-control experiments. Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained film footage of an autopsy of a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Grey recovered from Roswell, but later admitted it was a &amp;ldquo;reconstruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greys are frequently associated with alien abduction claims, accounting for a significant percentage of reported encounters in various countries. Abduction claims are often described as traumatic, similar to human abduction or sexual assault. The eyes of the Greys are often a focal point, with claims of inducing hallucinogenic states or emotions through staring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34;&gt;Psychocultural expression of intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#psychocultural-expression-of-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the presence of Grey aliens in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey aliens have become a common depiction of extraterrestrials in fiction, replacing the earlier &amp;ldquo;little green men.&amp;rdquo; They have appeared in films and television shows such as &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;. During the 1990s, plotlines linking Greys to conspiracy theories became prevalent, as seen in &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Other examples include the &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; video game franchise, &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Dad!&lt;/em&gt;. The film &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; features a Grey alien who attributes the Greys&amp;rsquo; presence in pop culture to government manipulation. The film &lt;em&gt;Dark Skies&lt;/em&gt; features child abduction by Greys. Greys also appear in the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Alien&lt;/em&gt; and the game &lt;em&gt;Greyhill Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-film&#34;&gt;Alien (film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; is a 1979 science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon. The film follows the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo as they encounter a deadly extraterrestrial creature. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial spaceship Nostromo is returning to Earth when its computer detects a transmission from a nearby planetoid. The crew investigates a derelict alien spaceship and discovers a chamber containing hundreds of eggs. One of the crew members, Kane, is attacked by a creature that attaches itself to his face. The creature eventually detaches itself, and Kane appears to be fine. However, during a meal, a small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him. The crew then tries to hunt down and kill the alien, which grows into a deadly creature. The crew members are killed off one by one, until only Ripley remains. She initiates the ship&amp;rsquo;s self-destruct sequence and escapes in a shuttle, but the alien stows away. Ripley manages to blast the alien into space before putting herself into stasis for the return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veronica Cartwright&lt;/strong&gt; as Lambert, the navigator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Dean Stanton&lt;/strong&gt; as Brett, the engineering technician.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Hurt&lt;/strong&gt; as Kane, the executive officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian Holm&lt;/strong&gt; as Ash, the science officer who is revealed to be an android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yaphet Kotto&lt;/strong&gt; as Parker, the chief engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolaji Badejo&lt;/strong&gt; as the alien.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helen Horton&lt;/strong&gt; as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo&amp;rsquo;s computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing &lt;a href=&#34;#writing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett collaborated on the screenplay, with O&amp;rsquo;Bannon initially writing 29 pages titled &lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt;. The story was influenced by various science fiction and horror works, including &lt;em&gt;The Thing from Another World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forbidden Planet&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Vampires&lt;/em&gt;. The script was pitched as &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Jaws&lt;/em&gt; in space&amp;rdquo;. Hill and Giler made revisions to the script, adding the android character Ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th Century-Fox greenlit &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; after the success of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Ridley Scott was chosen as the director. Scott created detailed storyboards, which led to the film&amp;rsquo;s budget being doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;casting&#34;&gt;Casting &lt;a href=&#34;#casting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casting calls were held in New York City and London. Scott wanted strong actors to focus on the film&amp;rsquo;s visual style. The crew of the Nostromo was intended to resemble working astronauts, described as &amp;ldquo;truckers in space&amp;rdquo;. Scott wrote backstories for each character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filming took place at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios near London, and model filming was done at Bray Studios. The production schedule was short due to the film&amp;rsquo;s low budget. Sets were constructed for the alien planetoid, the Nostromo, and the derelict spacecraft. The space suits were thick and bulky, causing discomfort for the actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-production&#34;&gt;Post-production &lt;a href=&#34;#post-production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing and post-production took roughly 20 weeks. The film was edited to have a slow pace to build suspense. One scene that was cut involved Ripley encountering Dallas and Brett, who had been partially cocooned by the alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Goldsmith composed the musical score. Scott initially wanted Isao Tomita, but Fox wanted a more familiar composer. Goldsmith&amp;rsquo;s score was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Grammy Award, and it won a BAFTA Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design &lt;a href=&#34;#design&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H. R. Giger designed the alien and its environment. The &amp;ldquo;facehugger&amp;rdquo; was the first creature Giger designed. The &amp;ldquo;chestburster&amp;rdquo; design was inspired by Francis Bacon&amp;rsquo;s painting &lt;em&gt;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-alien&#34;&gt;The alien &lt;a href=&#34;#the-alien&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giger made conceptual paintings of the adult alien before settling on the final version. Carlo Rambaldi manufactured the head. Bolaji Badejo portrayed the alien in most scenes. Scott chose not to show the full alien for most of the film to create a sense of terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sets&#34;&gt;Sets &lt;a href=&#34;#sets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sets of the Nostromo&amp;rsquo;s three decks were created in one piece. Ron Cobb created industrial-style symbols and color-coded signs. The company that owns the Nostromo is referred to as &amp;ldquo;Weylan-Yutani&amp;rdquo;. Art director Roger Christian used scrap metal and parts to create set pieces and props.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spaceships-and-planets&#34;&gt;Spaceships and planets &lt;a href=&#34;#spaceships-and-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Cobb and Chris Foss worked on designs for the spaceship and space suits. Cobb created sketches of the ship&amp;rsquo;s interiors and exteriors. The spaceships and planets were shot using models and miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;title-sequence&#34;&gt;Title sequence &lt;a href=&#34;#title-sequence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, 20th Century Fox released a &amp;ldquo;Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut&amp;rdquo; of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, which included restored footage and recut scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics have analyzed &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s sexual overtones and its use of abjection. The film has been interpreted as a metaphor for male fear of penetration and as a representation of the &amp;ldquo;monstrous-feminine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite initial mixed reviews, &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; has received critical acclaim over the years and is seen as one of the most influential science-fiction films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cultural-influences&#34;&gt;Cultural influences &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-influences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. The &amp;ldquo;chestburster&amp;rdquo; effect was parodied in Mel Brooks&amp;rsquo;s comedy &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;. Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; video game series was significantly influenced by &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;merchandise&#34;&gt;Merchandise &lt;a href=&#34;#merchandise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of the film. &lt;em&gt;Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt; magazine published a graphic novel adaptation. Model kits and action figures of the alien were released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;school-play-adaptation&#34;&gt;School play adaptation &lt;a href=&#34;#school-play-adaptation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, students at North Bergen High School adapted the film into a play, which gained social media recognition and praise from Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two downloadable content packs for the video game &lt;em&gt;Alien: Isolation&lt;/em&gt; depict alternate versions of key events from the film, with the original cast members reprising their roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; led to three direct sequels: &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; (1986), &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt; (1992), and &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt; (1997). The story of Ripley&amp;rsquo;s encounters with the aliens became the thematic and narrative core of the series. The film series resulted in a media franchise with novels, comic books, video games, and merchandise. A prequel series was started with &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt; (2012) and continued with &lt;em&gt;Alien: Covenant&lt;/em&gt; (2017).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-vs-predator-2004-film&#34;&gt;Alien vs. Predator (2004 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-vs-predator-2004-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2004 science fiction action horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, &lt;em&gt;Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt; brings together the titular creatures from the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt; franchises. The story draws inspiration from a 1989 comic book and incorporates elements of Aztec mythology and the writings of Erich von Däniken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Antarctica, a Predator ship melts a hole in the ice, revealing a buried pyramid. Charles Weyland assembles a team to investigate. The team discovers evidence of an ancient civilization and a sacrificial chamber. Three Predators arrive and descend into the pyramid, where they encounter the humans and awakened Xenomorphs. Battles ensue, and Lex Woods and Sebastian De Rosa learn about the Predators&amp;rsquo; history on Earth through hieroglyphs. They discover that the Predators have been visiting Earth for millennia, teaching humans to build pyramids and using them for rite of passage rituals involving Xenomorphs. Lex and Sebastian ally with a Predator named Scar to prevent the Xenomorphs from escaping. Scar destroys the pyramid, but the Xenomorph Queen attacks. Lex and Scar defeat the Queen, and an elder Predator gifts Lex a spear. A Predalien chestburster erupts from Scar&amp;rsquo;s body on the Predator spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanaa Lathan stars as Alexa &amp;ldquo;Lex&amp;rdquo; Woods, an experienced guide. Raoul Bova plays Professor Sebastian De Rosa, an Italian archaeologist. Lance Henriksen portrays Charles Bishop Weyland, the head of Weyland Corporation. Ewen Bremner is Dr. Graeme Miller, the main scientist. Colin Salmon plays Maxwell Stafford, Weyland&amp;rsquo;s assistant. Tommy Flanagan is Mark Verheiden, a member of the armed escort. Tom Woodruff Jr. plays the Alien/Grid, and Ian Whyte plays the Predator/Scar and other Predators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Cameron had been working on a fifth &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; film, and Ridley Scott had a concept to explore the origins of the alien creatures. However, upon learning of &lt;em&gt;Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt;, Cameron ceased work, believing it would damage the franchise. Ridley Scott also expressed disinterest in the &lt;em&gt;Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt; films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept originated from the &lt;em&gt;Aliens versus Predator&lt;/em&gt; comic book. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created a spec screenplay in 1990–1991. The project was delayed due to &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt;. Paul W. S. Anderson pitched John Davis a story adapting the Machiko Noguchi series. Anderson began working on the film after completing the script for &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt;, with Shane Salerno co-writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;story-and-setting&#34;&gt;Story and setting &lt;a href=&#34;#story-and-setting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenced by Erich von Däniken and Aztec mythology, Anderson depicted Predators teaching humans to build pyramids and being treated as gods. The Predators would use Earth for rite of passage rituals every 100 years, hunting Aliens. If overwhelmed, the Predators would use self-destruct weapons. H. P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;At the Mountains of Madness&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Aliens vs. Predator&lt;/em&gt; comic series influenced the story. The film is set on Bouvet Island in Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;casting&#34;&gt;Casting &lt;a href=&#34;#casting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lance Henriksen was the first actor cast, maintaining continuity with the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; series. He plays Charles Bishop Weyland, tying into the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Sanaa Lathan was cast as Alexa Woods. Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered for a cameo as Major Alan &amp;ldquo;Dutch&amp;rdquo; Schaeffer from &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt;. Sigourney Weaver declined to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming-and-set-designs&#34;&gt;Filming and set designs &lt;a href=&#34;#filming-and-set-designs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production began in 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague. Richard Bridgland designed sets, props, and vehicles. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed, including interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid&amp;rsquo;s designs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilizations. Miniatures were used to enhance realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amalgamated Dynamics, Inc. (ADI) designed costumes, miniatures, and effects. The Predators&amp;rsquo; wrist blades were extended, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created. Each Predator was given a unique mask. A hydraulic Alien puppet was created for faster movements. CGI use was minimized. The Alien queen was filmed using practical, puppet, and computer-generated versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harald Kloser composed the film&amp;rsquo;s score, recorded in London. The score album was released on iTunes and CD, receiving mixed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film received generally negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported 21% positive reviews, with the consensus being &amp;ldquo;Gore without scares and cardboard cut-out characters make this clash of the monsters a dull sit.&amp;rdquo; Metacritic gave the film a score of 29 out of 100, indicating &amp;ldquo;generally unfavorable&amp;rdquo; reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1977 American science fiction drama film directed and written by Steven Spielberg. It tells the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue-collar worker in Indiana, and Jillian, a single mother, whose lives are changed after encounters with unidentified flying objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977, French scientist Claude Lacombe and his team examine Flight 19, found abandoned in the Sonoran Desert, and the SS Cotopaxi, found in the Gobi Desert. Near Indianapolis, Roy Neary has a close encounter with a UFO, becoming obsessed with a mountain shape. Jillian Guiler&amp;rsquo;s son, Barry, is abducted by a UFO. Lacombe&amp;rsquo;s team investigates increasing UFO activity, discovering a five-tone musical phrase. The coordinates point to Devils Tower in Wyoming. Roy and Jillian, along with others experiencing visions, head to Devils Tower, which is being evacuated by the US Army. They reach the site as UFOs appear. Scientists communicate with the UFOs using light and sound. A mothership arrives, releasing humans and animals, including Barry. Roy is chosen to join the extraterrestrials, entering the mothership as it departs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Dreyfuss stars as Roy Neary, an electrical lineman. François Truffaut plays Claude Lacombe, a French scientist. Teri Garr is Ronnie Neary, Roy&amp;rsquo;s wife, and Melinda Dillon portrays Jillian Guiler. Cary Guffey plays Barry Guiler, Jillian&amp;rsquo;s son. Bob Balaban appears as David Laughlin, Lacombe&amp;rsquo;s assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development &lt;a href=&#34;#development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;rsquo;s inspiration came from Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s childhood experience watching a meteor shower. He developed a deal with Columbia Pictures in 1973. J. Allen Hynek, a UFO consultant, was hired. NASA declined to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filming&#34;&gt;Filming &lt;a href=&#34;#filming&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal photography began in May 1976. Filming locations included Burbank, California; Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming; airship hangars in Mobile, Alabama; and a railroad depot in Bay Minette, Alabama. The Sonora Desert sequence was filmed at the Dumont Dunes, California, and the Dharmsala-India exteriors were filmed near Mumbai, India. Technical and budgetary problems arose during filming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-effects&#34;&gt;Visual effects &lt;a href=&#34;#visual-effects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, and Carlo Rambaldi designed the extraterrestrials. The mothership was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-production&#34;&gt;Post-production &lt;a href=&#34;#post-production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kahn was the film editor. Pick-ups were commissioned, with John A. Alonzo, László Kovács, and Douglas Slocombe working on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Williams composed the film score, including the iconic five-tone motif. Spielberg called Williams&amp;rsquo;s work &amp;ldquo;When You Wish Upon a Star meets science fiction.&amp;rdquo; Phillip Dodds from ARP Instruments installed the synthesizer on set and was cast as Jean Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film explores themes of humanity&amp;rsquo;s readiness to join the cosmos, the impact of new technologies, and spiritual yearning. Judeo-Christian analogies are present, with Devils Tower paralleling Mount Sinai. Communication and tolerance are also highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-and-reception&#34;&gt;Release and reception &lt;a href=&#34;#release-and-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film premiered in New York City on November 16, 1977, and was released nationally in December. It became a box office success, grossing over $300 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews were mostly positive, with praise for Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s vision and the film&amp;rsquo;s climax. Some critics noted a lack of warmth compared to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several versions of the film have been released, including the original theatrical version, the Special Edition (1980), and the Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut (1998).

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;interdimensional-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Interdimensional UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#interdimensional-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interdimensional UFO hypothesis (IUH) proposes that unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings result from encounters with other &amp;ldquo;dimensions&amp;rdquo; that coexist alongside our own. This idea is supported by ufologists who suggest that UFOs are a modern manifestation of phenomena throughout human history, previously attributed to mythological or supernatural beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context of the interdimensional UFO hypothesis, tracing its roots from pre-modern concepts to modern ufology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-modern-history&#34;&gt;Pre-modern history &lt;a href=&#34;#pre-modern-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts similar to &amp;ldquo;other dimensions&amp;rdquo; exist in various religious and mystical traditions. Islamic mysticism, known as Sufism, includes the concept of &lt;em&gt;al-ghayb&lt;/em&gt;, referring to the hidden and unseen. Within this tradition, &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;ālam al-mithāl&lt;/em&gt;, or &amp;ldquo;the world of similitude,&amp;rdquo; is considered an intermediary realm between the physical and spiritual worlds, inhabited by intelligent non-human entities such as jinn and angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theorists&#34;&gt;Theorists &lt;a href=&#34;#theorists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces key figures who have advanced the interdimensional UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, spiritualists believed in &amp;ldquo;other dimensions.&amp;rdquo; H.P. Blavatsky popularized the term &amp;ldquo;planes,&amp;rdquo; proposing a cosmology of seven planes. The term &amp;ldquo;ether&amp;rdquo; was adopted from ancient Greek and incorporated into occult writings. Charles Webster Leadbeater and Annie Besant introduced the &amp;ldquo;etheric plane&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;etheric body&amp;rdquo; in Theosophy. The first use of the word, as &lt;em&gt;inter-dimensional&lt;/em&gt;, is in a novel by Z Gale of 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34;&gt;Meade Layne and &amp;lsquo;Ether Ships&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#meade-layne-and-ether-ships&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meade Layne, an occultist, claimed in 1947 that flying discs were &amp;ldquo;etheric.&amp;rdquo; Layne claimed telepathic communication with &amp;ldquo;people in the saucers,&amp;rdquo; arguing that objects could pass from an etheric to a dense level of matter. He stated that these visitors were human beings living in their own world with good intentions. Layne is regarded as the earliest proponent of the interdimensional hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34;&gt;John Keel and &amp;lsquo;Ultraterrestrials&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#john-keel-and-ultraterrestrials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Keel coined the term &amp;ldquo;ultraterrestrials&amp;rdquo; to describe UFO occupants as non-human entities existing in a wavelength of energy undetectable to us. In his book &lt;em&gt;UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse&lt;/em&gt;, Keel argued that a non-human intelligence has staged events to propagate erroneous belief systems, including monsters, ghosts, demons, fairies, vampires, mystery airships, anomalous creatures, poltergeists, and UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hynek-and-vallée&#34;&gt;Hynek and Vallée &lt;a href=&#34;#hynek-and-vall%c3%a9e&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and scientific advisor to the U.S. Air Force UFO studies, pioneered the &amp;ldquo;Close Encounter&amp;rdquo; classification system. Jacques Vallée, a student of Hynek, served as the inspiration for a character in the film &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Reality&lt;/em&gt;, Vallée and Hynek considered the possibility of &amp;ldquo;interlocking universes.&amp;rdquo; Vallée argued for a &amp;ldquo;parallel universe co-existing with our own&amp;rdquo; in his book &lt;em&gt;Passport to Magonia&lt;/em&gt;. Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1990 paper &amp;ldquo;Five Arguments Against the Extraterrestrial Origin of Unidentified Flying Objects&amp;rdquo; summarized his objections to the extraterrestrial hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the presence of the interdimensional UFO hypothesis in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 film &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&lt;/em&gt; utilizes the interdimensional hypothesis, describing ancient aliens traveling into &amp;ldquo;the space between the spaces.&amp;rdquo; The 2014 movie &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; employs a mix of the interdimensional and time-traveler hypotheses, with future humans evolving to exist in five dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-contrasting-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Other contrasting hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#other-contrasting-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section contrasts the IUH with other hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IUH contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis, which suggests UFO sightings are caused by visitations from outside Earth, and the psychosocial hypothesis, which argues UFO sightings are best explained as psychological or social phenomena. Other contrasting hypotheses include the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, space animal hypothesis, and time-traveler hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uncontacted peoples</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_87f3a49b74f0/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_87f3a49b74f0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;uncontacted-peoples&#34;&gt;Uncontacted Peoples &lt;a href=&#34;#uncontacted-peoples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncontacted peoples are Indigenous groups who live without sustained contact with neighboring communities and the world community. They choose to remain isolated, and are referred to as indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. Estimates suggest there are between 100 and 200 uncontacted tribes, totaling up to 10,000 individuals, primarily located in South America, especially northern Brazil. Knowledge about these groups is mainly gathered from neighboring Indigenous communities and aerial footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition&#34;&gt;Definition &lt;a href=&#34;#definition&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;uncontacted peoples&amp;rdquo; refers to Indigenous groups who have remained largely isolated, maintaining their traditional lifestyles independently from political or governmental entities. While most Indigenous groups have had some form of contact due to European exploration and colonization, &amp;ldquo;uncontacted&amp;rdquo; signifies a lack of sustained contact with the majority of non-Indigenous society today. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights calls them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; defined by their rejection of contact with outsiders, including those who previously had contact but chose to return to isolation. These groups are viewed as contemporaries of modernity, not relics of the past. A 2009 United Nations report also includes &amp;ldquo;peoples in initial contact&amp;rdquo; who are beginning to integrate into mainstream society. International organizations emphasize their agency by calling them &amp;ldquo;Indigenous peoples in isolation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;in voluntary isolation,&amp;rdquo; also known as &amp;ldquo;hidden peoples&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uncontacted tribes.&amp;rdquo; Historically, European colonial ideas about uncontacted peoples were influenced by the search for Prester John and the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying them as &amp;ldquo;lost tribes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relations-with-outsiders&#34;&gt;Relations with Outsiders &lt;a href=&#34;#relations-with-outsiders&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International organizations emphasize protecting indigenous peoples&amp;rsquo; lands and environment, preventing exploitation and abuse, and avoiding contact to prevent the spread of modern diseases. Historic exploitation has led governments to grant legal protection and land rights to uncontacted peoples, such as in the Vale do Javari in Brazil and North Sentinel Island in India. In 1961, British explorer Richard Mason was killed by the Panará tribe. Contact in 1973, when the BR-163 road was built through their territory, led to disease and environmental degradation, killing over 250 of the 350 Panará members within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contention often arises from governments&amp;rsquo; desire to extract natural resources. In Brazil, the government attempted assimilation in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was created, securing protected lands. In Colombia, contact with the Nukak tribe by an evangelical group led to respiratory infections, clashes with drug traffickers, and the death of over half the tribe, resulting in government relocation and poverty. Exploitation for lumbering, ranching, oil prospecting, and poaching poses significant dangers. Former Peruvian President Alan García claimed uncontacted groups were a &amp;ldquo;fabrication of environmentalists.&amp;rdquo; In 2016, a Chinese mining subsidiary in Bolivia ignored signs of encroaching on uncontacted tribes. Missionaries can also cause great damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Acre Indians contacted the Brazilian government due to threats from cocaine traffickers, indicating awareness of the outside world and strategic decisions to avoid contact. Satellite images show tribes migrating away from roads and logging. Indigenous rights activists advocate for leaving isolated peoples alone to protect their self-determination. FUNAI collaborates with experts to make controlled initial contact, operating trading posts for metal tools and cooking instruments, preventing conflicts, and delivering vaccinations. However, FUNAI reported receiving only 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, FUNAI released videos and images of tribes to raise public awareness and protect them from commercial pressures, investigating a possible mass homicide against the Flecheiros tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Human Rights Council (2009) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (2013) introduced guidelines including the right to choose self-isolation. Reports of &amp;ldquo;human safaris&amp;rdquo; in India&amp;rsquo;s Andaman Islands and the Peruvian Amazon, where tourists seek to view uncontacted peoples, are controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;by-region&#34;&gt;By Region &lt;a href=&#34;#by-region&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sentinelese&#34;&gt;Sentinelese &lt;a href=&#34;#sentinelese&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sentinelese people of North Sentinel Island reject contact, often with lethal force. Their language differs significantly from other Andaman languages, suggesting millennia of isolation. Experts consider them the most isolated people in the world. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997. In 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary, was killed while illegally visiting the island. In 2025, a US citizen was arrested for making an unauthorized landing on the island. Survival International condemned these actions, noting the vulnerability of uncontacted peoples to contact-induced diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shompen&#34;&gt;Shompen &lt;a href=&#34;#shompen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shompen are the Indigenous people of Great Nicobar Island, with an estimated population of 300 in 2001. They practice a hunter-gatherer economy. Survival International identifies them as one of the most isolated peoples, with most refusing interactions with outsiders. The proposed Great Nicobar Development Plan, including an airport, international port, and industrial park, threatens their way of life. In February 2024, 39 genocide experts warned that the development would be a &amp;ldquo;death sentence&amp;rdquo; for the Shompen due to increased population and exposure to outside diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;south-america&#34;&gt;South America &lt;a href=&#34;#south-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bolivia&#34;&gt;Bolivia &lt;a href=&#34;#bolivia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toromona are an uncontacted people living near the Madidi and Heath Rivers. The government has created a protected area within Madidi National Park for them. Among the Ayoreo people of the Gran Chaco, a small number of uncontacted nomadic hunter-gatherers reside in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park. Pacahuaras are believed to be living in voluntary isolation in Pando Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brazil&#34;&gt;Brazil &lt;a href=&#34;#brazil&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the 1970s, Brazil attempted to move people on commercially cultivatable lands. In 1987, the Department of Isolated Indians (FUNAI) was established, and the Vale do Javari was declared perpetually sealed off. In 2007, FUNAI reported 67 uncontacted Indigenous peoples, up from 40 in 2005. The Awá people live in the eastern Amazon rainforest, with approximately 350 members, 100 of whom are uncontacted. Their tribe is at risk due to conflicts with logging interests. The Kawahiva live in northern Mato Grosso, constantly moving and known primarily from physical evidence. In 2013, the government released video of the Kawahiva filmed in 2011. In 2025, FUNAI confirmed that the demarcation of the Kawahiva do Rio Pardo territory will happen by the end of 2025. The Korubu live in the lower Vale do Javari. The Flecheiros (&amp;ldquo;arrow people&amp;rdquo;) also live in the Vale do Javari. Other tribes may include the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and the Himarimã.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, two brothers of the Piripkura tribe initiated contact with FUNAI after their fire went out, becoming the focus of the documentary &lt;em&gt;Piripkura&lt;/em&gt;. Another man, the &amp;ldquo;Man of the Hole,&amp;rdquo; lived alone on 8,000 hectares, digging hundreds of holes. He was found dead in his dwelling in August 2022. Since 2021, uncontacted peoples in Brazil have been threatened by illegal land grabbers, loggers, and gold miners. The government of Jair Bolsonaro signaled its intention to develop the Amazon and reduce Indigenous reservations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia is regarded as offering maximum protection to uncontacted Indigenous people through tribal reserves and strict patrolling. The Nukak people are nomadic hunter-gatherers living between the Guaviare and Inírida rivers. Groups, including the Carabayo, Yuri, and Passé, reside in Río Puré National Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two isolated Indigenous peoples of Ecuador live in the Amazon region: the Tagaeri and the Taromenane, both eastern Huaorani peoples living in Yasuni National Park. These semi-nomadic people live in small groups, subsisting on hunting, gathering, and some crops. Since 2007, national policy mandates untouchability, self-determination, equality, and no contact. In 2013, more than 20 Taromenane were killed by Waorani, another Huaorani group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paraguay&#34;&gt;Paraguay &lt;a href=&#34;#paraguay&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 100 Ayoreo people, some of whom are in the Totobiegosode tribe, live uncontacted in the forest. They are nomadic hunter-gatherers in Amotocodie. They are the last uncontacted peoples south of the Amazon Basin, threatened by illegal deforestation. Brazilian company Yaguarete Porá S.A. is converting their ancestral territory into cattle ranching land. The Union of Ayoreo Natives of Paraguay is working for their protection, with support from the Iniciativa Amotocodie. In 2021, the Ayoreo appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to save their land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nomole (Mashco-Piro) are nomadic Arawak-speaking hunter-gatherers who inhabit Manú National Park. In 1998, their number was estimated at 100 to 250. They speak a dialect of the Piro languages. Amid incursions on their land, the tribe has made it clear they do not wish to be contacted. In July 2024, video and images of dozens of uncontact&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planetary objects proposed in religion, astrology, ufology and pseudoscience</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_2684e1d7f984/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_2684e1d7f984/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;non-scientific-hypothetical-objects&#34;&gt;Non-scientific hypothetical objects &lt;a href=&#34;#non-scientific-hypothetical-objects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses planetary objects proposed in religion, astrology, ufology, and pseudoscience that lack scientific evidence. It distinguishes these from scientifically accepted hypothetical astronomical objects and fictional planets in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kolob&#34;&gt;Kolob &lt;a href=&#34;#kolob&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolob is a star or planet described in the Book of Abraham, a sacred text in the Latter Day Saint movement. While the Book of Abraham refers to Kolob as a &amp;ldquo;star,&amp;rdquo; it also refers to planets as stars, leading Latter Day Saints to commonly view Kolob as a planet. It is described as the heavenly body closest to the throne of God and is said to have &amp;ldquo;signified&amp;rdquo; the first creation according to Joseph Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lilith&#34;&gt;Lilith &lt;a href=&#34;#lilith&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilith is a fictitious, invisible moon of Earth proposed in 1918 by astrologer Walter Gorn Old (Sepharial). Sepharial claimed Lilith was the same second moon that scientist Georg Waltemath claimed to have discovered twenty years earlier, but which was never confirmed. Sepharial claimed to be the first to observe Waltemath&amp;rsquo;s moon crossing the Sun. The scientific community had already discredited Waltemath&amp;rsquo;s proposed moon. While fringe groups believe in Lilith&amp;rsquo;s existence, astrologers now generally use the name for the position of the Moon&amp;rsquo;s apogee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-modern-astrology&#34;&gt;In modern astrology &lt;a href=&#34;#in-modern-astrology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern astrology, &amp;ldquo;Lilith&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Black Moon Lilith&amp;rdquo; refers to a point on the horoscope representing the Moon&amp;rsquo;s apogee. This point is sometimes defined as the second focus of the ellipse described by the Moon&amp;rsquo;s orbit. It takes approximately 8 years and 10 months for this point to complete a circuit through the zodiac, tracking the apsidal precession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planets-proposed-by-l-ron-hubbard&#34;&gt;Planets proposed by L. Ron Hubbard &lt;a href=&#34;#planets-proposed-by-l-ron-hubbard&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, proposed a Galactic Confederacy as part of his cosmology. This confederacy consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets, including Earth, then known as &amp;ldquo;Teegeeack.&amp;rdquo; Helatrobus is another planet mentioned in Scientology doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ummo&#34;&gt;Ummo &lt;a href=&#34;#ummo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummo is a hypothetical planet believed to be located in the Constellation Virgo. A series of claims describe aliens from Ummo communicating with people on Earth through detailed documents and letters. The Ummo affair gained attention in France and Spain during the 1960s. Ummoism refers to groups interested in studying the ideas presented in the Ummo letters. José Luis Jordán Peña has claimed responsibility for writing the letters and instigating Ummoism, leading many to believe Ummo is a hoax. Jacques Vallée compared the Ummo documents to Borges&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.&amp;rdquo; Mike Dash notes that Ummoism began on February 6, 1966, in Madrid, when Jordán Peña claimed to have seen a circular object with a symbol resembling the alchemical sign for Uranus. Fernando Sesma Manzano, a contactee, became involved after receiving documents purportedly from the Ummites. Jean-Pierre Petit claims to have detected signs of superior intelligence in the Ummite writings and that they have inspired his research in cosmology and magnetohydrodynamics. Antonio Ribera compiled 403 Ummo words in 1978, and Jean Pollion listed over a thousand words in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two theories have been formulated by analysts of Ummite letters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jean Pollion considers each letter (sound or phoneme) in words transcribed in typewritten form to be signifying, calling these sounds &amp;ldquo;soncepts&amp;rdquo; and considering the language to be &amp;ldquo;ideophonemic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second theory considers that differences in spelling are of little significance and are due to differences in the understanding of foreign sounds by the typist(s), or to difficulties in alphabetic transcription, considering that language is made up of word-objects and not of &amp;ldquo;soncepts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1300 pages of letters have been registered, with references to 3850 pages in a 1988 letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash notes that the photographic evidence was suspect, and the letters, while sophisticated, could have originated on Earth. Jerome Clark notes that Jacques Vallée argued that the scientific content of the Ummo letters was knowledgeable but unremarkable, comparing the scientific references to a well-researched science fiction novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy over an &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; in the distance from Wolf 424 arose from the first letter, referenced D21 (May 1966), which states that the distance used by terrestrial astronomers is different from the real distance in decadimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planets-proposed-by-zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Planets proposed by Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#planets-proposed-by-zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s work has gained attention among ufologists, ancient astronaut theorists, and conspiracy theorists. He claimed to have found evidence in Sumerian texts that the human race was visited/created by extraterrestrials from a distant planet in the Solar System. He interpreted the Babylonian creation myth, the &lt;em&gt;Enuma Elish&lt;/em&gt;, by replacing the names of gods with hypothetical planets. Academics consider his work pseudoscience and pseudohistory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s theory proposes the planets Tiamat and Nibiru. Tiamat supposedly existed between Mars and Jupiter, and its orbit was disrupted by the arrival of Nibiru. The collision of Tiamat with one of Nibiru&amp;rsquo;s moons supposedly formed the asteroid belt and Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin claimed the Babylonians associated Nibiru with the god Marduk. He hypothesized it as a planet in a highly elliptic orbit around the Sun, with a perihelion passage some 3,600 years ago and an orbital period of about 3,450 years. He also claimed it was the home of the Anunnaki, a technologically advanced alien race who visited Earth in search of gold and created humanity by genetically crossing themselves with primates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites such as ZetaTalk have claimed that Nibiru or &amp;ldquo;Planet X&amp;rdquo; is a brown dwarf within our planetary system, soon to pass close to Earth. Sitchin disagreed that it is a star, with the timing and parameters of passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin also postulated that Pluto began life as Gaga, a satellite of Saturn, which was flung into orbit beyond Neptune due to Nibiru&amp;rsquo;s passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;serpo&#34;&gt;Serpo &lt;a href=&#34;#serpo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Serpo is an alleged top-secret exchange program between the United States government and an alien planet called Serpo in the Zeta Reticuli star system. Details of the alleged exchange program have appeared in UFO conspiracy stories, including an incident in 1983 involving Richard C. Doty and Linda Moulton Howe, and emails sent to a UFO discussion group run by Victor Martinez in 2005. Some versions state that Serpo is the nickname of the extrasolar planet, while others claim it is a mispronunciation of Serponia or Seinu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of Project Serpo was in a UFO email list maintained by Victor Martinez. According to the story, an alien survived a crash near Roswell in the late 1940s and was repatriated, leading to a relationship between the American government and the people of its home world in the Zeta Reticuli system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story claims that twelve American military personnel visited the planet between 1965 and 1978 and that all have since died from radiation levels from the two suns. Another version claims that eight team members returned, one died en route, one died on the planet, and two decided to remain on Serpo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criticism of Project Serpo stems from the lack of veracity of Richard Doty, who has been involved in other UFO-related activities and is considered a discredited source. There is no physical evidence supporting the project&amp;rsquo;s existence. Tim Swartz of &lt;em&gt;Mysteries Magazine&lt;/em&gt; expressed that the details of Project Serpo have varied considerably with different accounts. It has been alleged that the entire series of posts were designed to be viral marketing for a new book by Doty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Ryan, a proponent of publicizing the Project Serpo claims, stepped down from his role as webmaster for the Serpo material but maintains his belief that an extraterrestrial exchange program did occur, although the Serpo releases contained disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>David Grusch UFO whistleblower claims</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_daddd7e70514/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;david-grusch-former-us-military-intelligence-officers-claims-about-non-human-spacecraft-recovery&#34;&gt;David Grusch: Former U.S. Military Intelligence Officer&amp;rsquo;s Claims About &amp;ldquo;Non-Human&amp;rdquo; Spacecraft Recovery &lt;a href=&#34;#david-grusch-former-us-military-intelligence-officers-claims-about-non-human-spacecraft-recovery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article focuses on the claims made by David Grusch, a former U.S. Air Force officer and intelligence official, regarding the U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s alleged involvement in recovering and reverse-engineering &amp;ldquo;non-human&amp;rdquo; spacecraft. It also covers the responses to these claims from various experts and government entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Charles Grusch is introduced as an Afghanistan combat veteran and former intelligence officer who worked at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). From 2019 to 2021, he served as the NRO representative to the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force. He assisted in drafting the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023, which included whistleblower protections for UFO reporting. The section notes that Congressional interest in UFOs increased prior to Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims due to the downing of four objects by the Air Force in February 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gruschs-claims&#34;&gt;Grusch&amp;rsquo;s Claims &lt;a href=&#34;#gruschs-claims&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details Grusch&amp;rsquo;s allegations, which were initially reported by Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal in &lt;em&gt;The Debrief&lt;/em&gt;. Grusch claims the U.S. government possesses multiple spacecraft of &amp;ldquo;non-human&amp;rdquo; origin and the corpses of their pilots. He alleges a secret UFO retrieval program, &amp;ldquo;substantive evidence&amp;rdquo; of white-collar crime to conceal UFO programs, and that officials have stated people have been killed to conceal these programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Le Parisien&lt;/em&gt;, Grusch elaborated, suggesting UFOs could be from extra dimensions, mentioning &amp;ldquo;football-field&amp;rdquo; sized crafts, the transfer of crashed UFOs to defense contractors, and &amp;ldquo;malevolent activity&amp;rdquo; by UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a Congressional hearing in July 2023, Grusch testified about being informed of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program to which he was denied access. He stated his belief that the U.S. government possesses UAP based on interviews with 40 witnesses. He also claimed the U.S. has retrieved &amp;ldquo;non-human &amp;lsquo;biologics&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; from the crafts. When asked about harm or injury related to cover-ups, Grusch said yes, but could only provide details in a SCIF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;responses-from-relevant-experts&#34;&gt;Responses from Relevant Experts &lt;a href=&#34;#responses-from-relevant-experts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the views of various experts on Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims. It highlights that his assertions are based on alleged documents and conversations, rather than testable evidence. The scientific community generally considers claims of government conspiracy to conceal extraterrestrial visitation untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Semeter of NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team states that without data or material evidence, evaluating the claims is impossible. Adam Frank, an astrophysics professor, criticizes the claims as hearsay and lacking extraordinary evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart Clark&amp;rsquo;s opinion piece in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; includes questions from scientists like Avi Loeb, Michael Garrett, and Sara Russell, who point out the lack of observed extraterrestrial activity and the ease of identifying extraterrestrial materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Eghigian, a history professor and UFO expert, notes the historical pattern of individuals making &amp;ldquo;bombshell allegations&amp;rdquo; about UFOs and the lack of corroboration. Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute, questions the absence of physical evidence and dismisses the claims as an &amp;ldquo;argument from authority.&amp;rdquo; Michael Shermer, publisher of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine, notes the lack of physical evidence and scientific community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicist Sean M. Carroll calls Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims &amp;ldquo;laughable&amp;rdquo; and describes him as a &amp;ldquo;complete crackpot.&amp;rdquo; NASA&amp;rsquo;s JPL director, Laurie Leshin, denies having seen spacecraft from outside this world. Michio Kaku suggests the burden of proof has shifted to the Pentagon, a statement criticized by Ross Pomeroy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;responses-from-the-united-states-government&#34;&gt;Responses from the United States Government &lt;a href=&#34;#responses-from-the-united-states-government&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the responses from various U.S. government entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;department-of-defense-and-nasa&#34;&gt;Department of Defense and NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#department-of-defense-and-nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre referred questions to the Department of Defense (DoD). A Pentagon spokesperson stated that AARO has not discovered verifiable information to substantiate claims of programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials. General Mark Milley stated he had never encountered evidence verifying Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims. NASA stated it has not found credible evidence of extraterrestrial life and that there is no evidence that UAPs are extraterrestrial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;congress&#34;&gt;Congress &lt;a href=&#34;#congress&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Mike Turner stated there is no evidence of the U.S. possessing UFOs from outer space. Senator Lindsey Graham found the claims unreasonable. Senator Josh Hawley said the allegations sounded close to what they were &amp;ldquo;grudgingly admitted to us in the briefing&amp;rdquo;. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand intends to hold a hearing to assess whether &amp;ldquo;rogue SAP programs&amp;rdquo; existed. Senator Marco Rubio said people with &amp;ldquo;first-hand knowledge&amp;rdquo; have shared information with his committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, Senators Chuck Schumer and Mike Rounds proposed the UAP Disclosure Act 2023, an amendment to the 2024 National Defence Authorization Act, to provide wider access to UAP records. The enrolled bill directs the National Archives to collect government documents about UAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, members of the House Oversight Committee received a classified briefing from the Intelligence Community Inspector General (IC IG) Thomas A. Monheim regarding UAP reporting transparency. Some members were frustrated by the lack of new information regarding Grusch&amp;rsquo;s allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2023-house-committee-oversight-and-accountability-hearing&#34;&gt;2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability Hearing &lt;a href=&#34;#2023-house-committee-oversight-and-accountability-hearing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Tim Burchett organized a hearing on July 26, 2023, in response to Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims. Grusch testified, repeating his earlier UFO claims. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked where to look for evidence, and Grusch offered to provide specifics in a closed environment. Officials later informed lawmakers that Grusch lacked security clearance to discuss the issues in a SCIF. Following the hearing, a bipartisan group of U.S. representatives called for the formation of a select committee on UAPs with subpoena power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AARO&amp;rsquo;s director Sean Kirkpatrick wrote that Grusch &amp;ldquo;has refused to speak with AARO&amp;rdquo; and that the hearing was &amp;ldquo;insulting&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sean-kirkpatrick&#34;&gt;Sean Kirkpatrick &lt;a href=&#34;#sean-kirkpatrick&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After retiring from AARO, Kirkpatrick wrote an opinion piece for &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; stating that the US Government UFO coverup allegations &amp;ldquo;derive from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosures of legitimate U.S. programs or related R&amp;amp;D that have nothing to do with extraterrestrial issues or technology.&amp;rdquo; He described the allegations&amp;rsquo; supporters as &amp;ldquo;a small group of interconnected believers and others with possibly less than honest intentions,&amp;rdquo; who promote a &amp;ldquo;whirlwind of tall tales, fabrication and secondhand or thirdhand retellings&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Peter Bergen, Kirkpatrick said that Grusch may have misinterpreted things or fallen under the influence of a core group of people. He characterized the situation as a &amp;ldquo;self licking ice cream cone,&amp;rdquo; where UFO true believers are carrying out a conspiracy to get the government involved in investigating aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media-reporting-on-gruschs-claims&#34;&gt;Media Reporting on Grusch&amp;rsquo;s Claims &lt;a href=&#34;#media-reporting-on-gruschs-claims&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines how the media has covered Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;connections-to-studies-funded-by-robert-bigelow&#34;&gt;Connections to Studies Funded by Robert Bigelow &lt;a href=&#34;#connections-to-studies-funded-by-robert-bigelow&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Kloor draws a connection between Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims and studies funded by Robert Bigelow, noting specific references to &amp;ldquo;a football field–sized UFO&amp;rdquo; in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reporting-on-psychiatric-treatment-received-by-grusch&#34;&gt;Reporting on Psychiatric Treatment Received by Grusch &lt;a href=&#34;#reporting-on-psychiatric-treatment-received-by-grusch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Klippenstein reported in &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; that Grusch was twice committed after incidents involving drunkenness and suicidal comments. Police records mentioned PTSD. Grusch was placed under an emergency custody order and transported to an emergency room. Grusch sued Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman for releasing the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;news-stories-and-commentary&#34;&gt;News Stories and Commentary &lt;a href=&#34;#news-stories-and-commentary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Pope, who previously ran the British Ministry of Defense &amp;ldquo;UFO Desk&amp;rdquo;, expressed doubt about confirming Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims. Marina Koren wrote that the case fits a pattern of unprovable claims. Matt Laslo described the sympathetic hearing of Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims by some members of Congress as an indication that &amp;ldquo;once-fringe notions have built-in fan bases in today&amp;rsquo;s Capitol&amp;rdquo;. Tucker Carlson publicized the claims. Tom Rogan was skeptical but opined that they should be further investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Prokop wrote that skeptics question whether Grusch is repeating tall tales. Sean Thomas expressed confusion that others have tried to convince officials and the public that UFOs are worthy of serious considerations. Ross Douthat noted that one interpretation is that parts of the U.S. government see benefit in promoting belief in UFOs. Matt Stieb described Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims as &amp;ldquo;crazy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezra Klein interviewed Leslie Kean, noting that reactions to her story about Grusch have been either to embrace it as definitive truth or dismiss it out of hand. Steven Greenstreet criticized Grusch for previously attending UFO conventions and associating with Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story received attention from multiple foreign mainstream news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disinformation-campaign-allegations&#34;&gt;Disinformation Campaign Allegations &lt;a href=&#34;#disinformation-campaign-allegations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grusch claimed that intentional disinformation was being promoted by the US government to cast doubt on the veracity of &amp;ldquo;non-human&amp;rdquo; UFO claims. Adam Gabbatt described Grusch&amp;rsquo;s position as &amp;ldquo;a common conspiracy trope in the UFO community&amp;rdquo;. Others have suggested that Grusch was given disinformation about aliens. Gareth Nicholson wrote that &amp;ldquo;the current UAP flap could be an attempt by the US military to engage in a disinformation campaign to disguise real aerospace breakthroughs or an attempt to flush out advanced technologies held by rivals such as Russia and China&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien&#34;&gt;Alien &lt;a href=&#34;#alien&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; franchise is a science fiction horror and action media franchise that began with the 1979 film &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. The series centers on Ellen Ripley&amp;rsquo;s battles with the extraterrestrial Xenomorph and the prequel series following the android David 8 and the Engineers. The franchise is owned by 20th Century Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Created by:&lt;/strong&gt; Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett
&lt;strong&gt;Original Work:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; (1979)
&lt;strong&gt;Owner:&lt;/strong&gt; 20th Century Studios
&lt;strong&gt;Years Active:&lt;/strong&gt; 1979–present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise &lt;a href=&#34;#premise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise depicts deadly encounters between humanity and the Xenomorph, a hostile extraterrestrial species. Humanity is a space-faring species, and space journeys require cryosleep. The megacorporation Weyland-Yutani Corp seeks to profit from the Aliens, manipulating and endangering characters. The series also explores the origin of the human race, with the Engineers sacrificing themselves to spark the genesis of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan O&amp;rsquo;Bannon and Ronald Shusett collaborated on the script for &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. Brandywine Productions bought the script, and 20th Century Fox invested millions after the success of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. The Ripley character was initially to be played by Tom Skerritt, but Sigourney Weaver was cast instead. Ridley Scott directed the film. H. R. Giger designed the alien creature and derelict ship, Mœbius created the spacesuits, and Ron Cobb provided the industrial design for the sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Cameron expressed interest in continuing the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; story in 1983. After Cameron&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Terminator&lt;/em&gt; became a hit, he and Gale Anne Hurd were approved to direct and produce &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. Following the second film, Weaver was not interested in returning, but she was offered a $5 million salary and a producer credit to make &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;/em&gt; faced script difficulties, trouble securing a director, and studio interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production on &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt; began in 1996. Weaver joined the project after being offered an $11 million salary and more creative control. The script resurrected the Ripley character via human cloning. Joss Whedon later said that he thought it had done &amp;ldquo;everything wrong&amp;rdquo; with his script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 21:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_200a71f90a18/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pentagon-ufo-videos&#34;&gt;Pentagon UFO Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#pentagon-ufo-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the widely publicized cockpit instrumentation display videos from US Navy fighter jets, often characterized as UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the videos, referencing historical UFO photographs and events. It details the initial incident on November 14, 2004, involving Commander David Fravor of the USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; Carrier Strike Group investigating radar indications of a possible target off the coast of southern California. The USS &lt;em&gt;Princeton&lt;/em&gt; had been tracking unusual aircraft for two weeks prior to the incident. Fravor&amp;rsquo;s account of encountering a white, oval object hovering above an ocean disturbance is highlighted, as well as the observations of other pilots. It also mentions Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, who recorded the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; video and coined the term &amp;ldquo;Tic Tac&amp;rdquo; to describe the object. The section also mentions the 2014-2015 incidents involving fighter pilots associated with the USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; carrier strike group operating off the East Coast of the United States, during which the GIMBAL and GOFAST videos were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-videos&#34;&gt;Release of Videos &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the public release of the videos. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on the incidents and published the &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL&amp;rdquo; videos in December 2017, while the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published the &amp;ldquo;GOFAST&amp;rdquo; video. Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, provided the videos to the press. Luis Elizondo, the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy. In September 2019, the Pentagon confirmed the videos were made by naval aviators. On April 27, 2020, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. In February 2020, the United States Navy confirmed that intelligence briefings have been provided to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021-release&#34;&gt;2021 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2021-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the release of additional footage in 2021. In April 2021, the Pentagon confirmed the authenticity of a video taken by Navy personnel aboard USS &lt;em&gt;Russell&lt;/em&gt; in 2019, showing a triangular object. Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acorn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metallic blimp&amp;rdquo;. In May 2021, a second video recorded by Navy personnel aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Omaha&lt;/em&gt; on July 15, 2019, was confirmed and is under review by the UAP Task Force. The video purportedly shows a spherical object flying over the ocean. Mick West commented on the video, suggesting it could simply be a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2023-release&#34;&gt;2023 Release &lt;a href=&#34;#2023-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the release of additional videos in 2023. In early 2023, an object was filmed by two MQ-9 drones in South Asia, initially believed to be anomalous but later identified as a commuter aircraft. On May 31, 2023, Sean M. Kirkpatrick shared an infrared video recorded in the western United States in 2021, which AARO concluded to be commercial aircraft. On April 19, 2023, the Pentagon released another video featuring MQ-9 drone footage from the Middle East depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon resembling a small &amp;ldquo;metallic orb&amp;rdquo;. Sean M. Kirkpatrick briefed a Senate Armed Services subcommittee on the video, but stated they are unable to fully identify anything from the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-explanations&#34;&gt;Potential Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the aerial phenomena recorded in the videos. As of 2020, the Department of Defense characterizes the phenomena as &amp;ldquo;unidentified&amp;rdquo;. Skeptical explanations include instrument malfunction, human observational error, or common aircraft. Mick West cautioned that believers in &amp;ldquo;alien disclosure&amp;rdquo; are &amp;ldquo;encroaching on these real issues of UAPs&amp;rdquo;. Adam Frank speculated that the UFOs could be drones deployed by rivals like Russia and China. Thomas Bania speculated that they could be some form of electronic warfare fielded by China or Russia. The US Navy updated its reporting guidelines for unexplained aerial observations. Senator Marco Rubio expressed concern that the UFOs may be Chinese or Russian technology. Admiral Gary Roughead said that most assessments were inconclusive. Jeff Wise suggests advancements in electronic warfare could deceive sensors. In 2023, David Fravor testified under oath regarding the USS Nimitz sighting, stating that the technology was far superior to anything the US had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the preliminary report on UAPs released by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on June 25, 2021. The report came to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, citing a lack of sufficient data. Some UAPs appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics, including high velocity and maneuverability. The report indicated that the UAP recordings probably were of physical objects and proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; category. The report raised concerns about safety and security issues and indicated that investigation of the topic would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pentagon-ufo-videos&#34;&gt;Pentagon UFO videos &lt;a href=&#34;#pentagon-ufo-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon UFO videos are visual recordings from United States Navy fighter jets, widely publicized as UFOs. These videos were recorded using forward-looking infrared (FLIR) targeting cameras from fighter jets based aboard the aircraft carriers USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; and USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; in 2004, 2014, and 2015. Additional footage was taken by other Navy personnel in 2019. The videos, characterized as officially documenting UFOs, have received extensive media coverage since 2017. The Pentagon officially released the first three videos of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in 2020 and confirmed the provenance of the leaked 2019 videos in 2021. Footage of UAPs was also released in 2023, sourced from MQ-9 military drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicity surrounding the videos has prompted explanations including drones or unidentified terrestrial aircraft, anomalous instrument readings, physical observational phenomena, human observational and interpretive error, and speculations of alien spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Pentagon UFO videos, referencing the broader history of UFO sightings and investigations. It mentions UFO photographs and links to other Wikipedia articles on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 14, 2004, Commander David Fravor of the USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; Carrier Strike Group investigated radar indications of a possible target off the coast of southern California. Fravor reported seeing a white, oval object hovering above an ocean disturbance. A second wave of fighters, including Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, recorded the FLIR video, with Underwood coining the term &amp;ldquo;Tic Tac&amp;rdquo; to describe the infrared image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2014–2015, fighter pilots associated with the USS &lt;em&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt; carrier strike group recorded the GIMBAL and GOFAST videos while operating off the East Coast of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-videos&#34;&gt;Release of videos &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-videos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the public release of the videos and the reactions that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 16, 2017, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on the incidents and published two videos, &amp;ldquo;FLIR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GIMBAL.&amp;rdquo; The &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published a video titled &amp;ldquo;GOFAST.&amp;rdquo; The reports led to speculation by UFO investigators. Journalism professor Keith Kloor criticized the reporting as thinly-sourced and slanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos were initially provided to the press by Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. Luis Elizondo, the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2019, the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were made by naval aviators. On April 27, 2020, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. In February 2020, the United States Navy confirmed that intelligence briefings have been provided to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021-release&#34;&gt;2021 release &lt;a href=&#34;#2021-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the release of additional videos and images in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2021, the Pentagon confirmed that video footage of an unidentified triangular object taken by Navy personnel aboard USS &lt;em&gt;Russell&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 was authentic. Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acorn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metallic blimp&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, the Pentagon confirmed a second video recorded by Navy personnel aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Omaha&lt;/em&gt; on July 15, 2019, showing a spherical object flying over the ocean. Mick West commented that the object was likely a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2023-release&#34;&gt;2023 release &lt;a href=&#34;#2023-release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the release of additional footage in 2023, including analysis of the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, an object was filmed by two MQ-9 drones in South Asia. Initially believed to be anomalous, the object was later identified as a commuter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 31, 2023, Sean M. Kirkpatrick shared an infrared video recorded in the western United States in 2021, which the AARO concluded to be commercial aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 19, 2023, the Pentagon released another video featuring MQ-9 drone footage from the Middle East depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Sean M. Kirkpatrick briefed a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that it resembled a small &amp;ldquo;metallic orb&amp;rdquo; but said they are unable to fully identify anything from this video. Some skeptics suggested it might be a balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-explanations&#34;&gt;Potential explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses potential explanations for the aerial phenomena recorded in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2020, the Department of Defense characterizes the phenomena as &amp;ldquo;unidentified.&amp;rdquo; Widespread media attention has led to various theories, including pseudoscientific explanations such as ufology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptical explanations include instrument malfunction, human observational illusion, or common aircraft. Mick West cautioned that believers in &amp;ldquo;alien disclosure&amp;rdquo; are encroaching on real issues and that the recorded UFOs might be commercial airplanes or balloons distorted by infrared glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicist Adam Frank speculated that the UFOs could be drones deployed by rivals like Russia and China. Astronomer Thomas Bania speculated that they could be electronic warfare technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Navy updated its guidelines for reporting unexplained aerial observations. A spokesman suggested that the increase in reported intrusions could be due to the rise in availability of unmanned aerial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Marco Rubio expressed concern that the UFOs may be Chinese or Russian technology. Retired Admiral Gary Roughead said that most assessments were inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Dodd and security expert Jack Weinstein say that neither China nor Russia presently have the capability to produce aircraft with such extraordinary capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Wise suggested that advancements in electronic warfare techniques could deceive sensors, resulting in false velocity and position information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, David Fravor testified under oath that the technology they faced was far superior to anything they had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) preliminary report on UAPs released on June 25, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report came to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, citing a lack of sufficient data. In a limited number of incidents, UAP appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics. Some of the UAPs appeared to move with no discernible means of propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report indicated that, in most cases, the UAP recordings probably were of physical objects. The report proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report raised concerns about safety and security issues and indicated that investigation of the topic would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses a Freedom of Information request made by The Black Vault for the release of more video footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, The Black Vault made a Freedom of Information request to the US Navy. The government confirmed it had more footage but refused to release it, citing concerns for national security.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34;&gt;Barney and Betty Hill Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-and-betty-hill-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article details the alleged alien abduction of Barney and Betty Hill in 1961, a case that gained significant notoriety and influenced the alien abduction narrative. The article covers the background of the Hills, the details of their reported encounter, the aftermath, analysis of the star map Betty Hill claimed to have seen, and the cultural impact of their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney and Betty Hill were an interracial couple living in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Barney was a postal worker and Betty was a social worker. They were active in civil rights and community affairs. The article also mentions that they are the grandparents of UFC fighter Angela Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-encounter&#34;&gt;UFO Encounter &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-encounter&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 19-20, 1961, the Hills claimed to have encountered a UFO while driving back from a vacation in Canada. Near Lancaster, New Hampshire, Betty noticed a bright light in the sky. They stopped near Twin Mountain to observe the object, which Betty viewed through binoculars. Barney initially thought it was a commercial airliner, but it rapidly descended towards them. They continued driving, observing the object near Cannon Mountain and the Old Man of the Mountain. South of Indian Head, the object descended rapidly, causing Barney to stop the car. He observed humanoid figures through binoculars. Fearing capture, Barney ran back to the car, and as they drove away, they heard beeping sounds and experienced a daze. They reported the incident to NICAP investigator Walter Webb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;immediate-aftermath&#34;&gt;Immediate Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#immediate-aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home, the Hills noted odd sensations and unexplained occurrences. Betty insisted on keeping their luggage near the back door. Their watches stopped working. Barney found the binocular strap torn and his shoes scraped. They both took showers to remove possible contamination and drew pictures of what they had seen. Betty&amp;rsquo;s dress was torn and had a pinkish powder on it. Shiny, concentric circles appeared on their car&amp;rsquo;s trunk, which affected a compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34;&gt;Initial Report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-report-to-the-us-air-force-and-nicap&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member, interviewed the Hills. Barney mentioned a &amp;ldquo;mental block&amp;rdquo; and suspected he was suppressing parts of the event. Webb concluded that they were truthful, and the incident likely occurred as reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bettys-dreams&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Dreams &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-dreams&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after the encounter, Betty began experiencing vivid dreams for five consecutive nights. In her dreams, they encountered a roadblock and were forced into a forest by small men in blue uniforms. The men appeared nearly human with greyish skin. They were eventually returned to their car and watched the craft depart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34;&gt;Medical Help and More Interviews &lt;a href=&#34;#medical-help-and-more-interviews&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills sought medical help to understand their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;missing-time&#34;&gt;Missing Time &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-time&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a follow-up interview with NICAP members C.D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann, the Hills realized they had &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; – a period of about seven hours they couldn&amp;rsquo;t account for. They recalled almost nothing of a 35-mile stretch of road and an image of a fiery orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;private-disclosure&#34;&gt;Private Disclosure &lt;a href=&#34;#private-disclosure&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the Hills privately disclosed their encounter to Captain Ben H. Swett of the United States Air Force, who was interested in the &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Hypnosis Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-hypnosis-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills underwent hypnosis with Dr. Benjamin Simon to recover their memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;barneys-sessions&#34;&gt;Barney&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#barneys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under hypnosis, Barney recalled the binocular strap breaking as he ran from the UFO. He remembered being compelled to drive into the woods and seeing six men. He described the beings&amp;rsquo; terrifying eyes and their communication through &amp;ldquo;thought transference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bettys-sessions&#34;&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s Sessions &lt;a href=&#34;#bettys-sessions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty&amp;rsquo;s account under hypnosis was similar to her dreams, with some differences. The technology on the craft was different, the short men differed significantly in physical appearance and the sequential order of the abduction differed. Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s memories in hypnotic regression were consistent with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simons-conclusions&#34;&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s Conclusions &lt;a href=&#34;#simons-conclusions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon concluded that the case was a psychological aberration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34;&gt;Post-Hypnosis Publicity and Barney&amp;rsquo;s and Betty&amp;rsquo;s Death &lt;a href=&#34;#post-hypnosis-publicity-and-barneys-and-bettys-death&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills initially kept a low profile. However, in 1965, a front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Boston Traveller&lt;/em&gt; revealed their story, leading to international attention. John G. Fuller wrote the book &lt;em&gt;The Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; about the case in 1966. Barney died in 1969, and Betty became a figure in the UFO community. Betty died in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-the-star-map&#34;&gt;Analyzing the Star Map &lt;a href=&#34;#analyzing-the-star-map&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Marjorie Fish, an amateur astronomer, attempted to decipher the star map Betty Hill had drawn. Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars and concluded that the map&amp;rsquo;s perspective matched the Zeta Reticuli star system. The analysis was debated, with Carl Sagan arguing it was a random alignment of points. Later, more accurate data from the Hipparcos mission led Fish to reject her hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interrupted-journey&#34;&gt;Interrupted Journey &lt;a href=&#34;#interrupted-journey&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Interrupted Journey&lt;/em&gt; by John G. Fuller detailed the Hills&amp;rsquo; claims. Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s niece, Kathleen Marden, further explored these themes in &lt;em&gt;Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rebutting-the-hills&#34;&gt;Rebutting the Hills &lt;a href=&#34;#rebutting-the-hills&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Macdonald argued that the Hills&amp;rsquo; experience was caused by misinterpreting an aircraft warning beacon on Cannon Mountain, combined with stress, sleep deprivation, and false memories. Robert Sheaffer criticized Betty Hill&amp;rsquo;s credibility, citing her UFO photos and later delusional stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34;&gt;Influence from &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#influence-from-the-outer-limits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney&amp;rsquo;s memories might have been influenced by &amp;ldquo;The Bellero Shield,&amp;rdquo; an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt;. Jason Colavito pointed out other episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; that aired before Barney&amp;rsquo;s hypnosis sessions that were even more reminiscent of the Hill&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-media&#34;&gt;In Popular Media &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hills&amp;rsquo; story has been depicted in various forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nonfictional-accounts&#34;&gt;Nonfictional Accounts &lt;a href=&#34;#nonfictional-accounts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney Hill appeared on &lt;em&gt;To Tell the Truth&lt;/em&gt; in 1966. Kathleen Marden and Stanton Friedman authored &lt;em&gt;Captured&lt;/em&gt; in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-fiction&#34;&gt;In Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1975 film &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; dramatized the Hills&amp;rsquo; abduction. The story has also been referenced in comic books, films like &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, virtual reality exhibits, and television series like &lt;em&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;uncrewed-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Uncrewed Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#uncrewed-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article provides an overview of spacecraft that operate without human presence on board, often referred to as uncrewed or robotic spacecraft. It covers their purpose, history, design considerations, control mechanisms, and various types, including space probes and cargo spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacecraft-without-people-on-board&#34;&gt;Spacecraft without people on board &lt;a href=&#34;#spacecraft-without-people-on-board&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introductory section defines uncrewed spacecraft as those without humans on board, highlighting their varying levels of autonomy, from remote control to pre-programmed operations. It distinguishes between space probes/observatories (for scientific measurements) and other types of uncrewed spacecraft.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;control&#34;&gt;Control &lt;a href=&#34;#control&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses how robotic spacecraft use telemetry to transmit data and status information back to Earth. Early spacecraft lacked remote control, but command systems were later developed. Increased autonomy is crucial for distant probes due to light travel time delays. Probes like &lt;em&gt;Cassini–Huygens&lt;/em&gt; and the Mars Exploration Rovers operate autonomously for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;space-probes-and-observatories&#34;&gt;Space Probes and Observatories &lt;a href=&#34;#space-probes-and-observatories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that explores outer space without orbiting Earth. These probes carry scientific instruments and can fly by, orbit, or land on planetary bodies, or even enter interstellar space. Space telescopes or observatories are telescopes in space that avoid atmospheric distortion and light pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cargo-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Cargo Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#cargo-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explains how robotic spacecraft are controlled, emphasizing the use of telemetry to transmit data and status information back to Earth. It notes that early spacecraft did not receive control signals from Earth, but command systems were later developed. The importance of increased autonomy for distant probes is highlighted, with examples like Cassini–Huygens and the Mars Exploration Rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry is used to transmit data and status information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early spacecraft lacked remote control capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased autonomy is crucial for distant probes due to light travel time delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missions Mentioned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sputnik 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explorer 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cassini–Huygens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mars Exploration Rovers&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section defines space probes as robotic spacecraft that explore outer space beyond Earth orbit. It describes their function of collecting and transmitting data back to Earth, and their various forms, including orbiters, landers, and rovers. It also mentions sample-return missions. The section also defines space telescopes or space observatories as telescopes in outer space used to observe astronomical objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space probes explore beyond Earth orbit and transmit data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space telescopes avoid atmospheric distortion and light pollution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trajectory planning involves Hohmann transfer orbits and gravitational slingshots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cargo-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Cargo Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#cargo-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; which are names given in ufology to humanoid races purportedly from the Pleiades star cluster. These beings are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans, with features like tall stature (6-7 ft), blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention pale-blue/grey or pastel purple skin tones. George Adamski is noted as one of the first to report contact with these beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding them often includes telepathy, benevolence, and physical beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on &amp;ldquo;Nordics,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nordic aliens,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tall Whites,&amp;rdquo; a type of humanoid extraterrestrial beings often discussed in ufology. These beings are said to originate from the Pleiades star cluster and are described as resembling Nordic, Germanic, or Scandinavian humans. They are typically depicted as taller than average humans (6-7 ft), with blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Some accounts mention skin tones of pale blue/grey or pastel purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Adamski, a Polish-American ufologist, is noted as one of the first to publicly claim contact with Nordic beings in the 1950s. The mythology surrounding these beings often includes themes of telepathy, benevolence, beauty, and grace. Telepathy is often described as the primary form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context and cultural influences surrounding the Nordic alien narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural historian David J. Skal suggests that the 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; may have inspired early stories of Nordic-type aliens. The film features an extraterrestrial arriving on Earth to warn humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bates College professor Stephanie Kelley-Romano describes alien abduction beliefs as a &amp;ldquo;living myth,&amp;rdquo; noting that Nordic aliens are often associated with spiritual growth, love, and protection among believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic aliens are often portrayed as benevolent beings concerned about Earth&amp;rsquo;s ecology and world peace, possessing telepathic powers and described as paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of encounters with Nordic aliens were common in Europe during the 1950s but became less frequent in later decades, as the grey alien became more prevalent in extraterrestrial encounter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2007 Alderney UFO sighting</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_40bc71f5c743/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 13:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_40bc71f5c743/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;2007-alderney-ufo-sighting&#34;&gt;2007 Alderney UFO sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#2007-alderney-ufo-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the reported UFO sighting that occurred on April 23, 2007, over Alderney in the Channel Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accounts-of-the-sighting&#34;&gt;Accounts of the sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#accounts-of-the-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the event, mentioning that a pilot, Ray Bowyer, reported seeing unidentified flying objects. An air traffic controller confirmed that another pilot had reported a similar sighting. Passengers on Bowyer&amp;rsquo;s aircraft also reported seeing unusual lights. Possible explanations for the sighting, such as earthquake lights and sun dogs, are also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bowyers-accounts&#34;&gt;Bowyer&amp;rsquo;s accounts &lt;a href=&#34;#bowyers-accounts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the account of Ray Bowyer, the pilot who initially reported the sighting. It details his description of the object as a &amp;ldquo;cigar-shaped brilliant white light,&amp;rdquo; initially thought to be reflections from greenhouses. Bowyer&amp;rsquo;s estimates of the object&amp;rsquo;s size and distance evolved, eventually describing it as being the size of a Boeing 737, then later as large as five or six battleships or a reasonably large town. The section includes details from a recorded conversation between Bowyer and an air traffic controller, who reported only a faint radar contact. Bowyer&amp;rsquo;s actions, such as using binoculars to observe the light, and his report to the Civil Aviation Authority are also covered. The Ministry of Defence&amp;rsquo;s initial reluctance to investigate and subsequent release of information, including a statement from a second pilot, are mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-witness-accounts&#34;&gt;Other witness accounts &lt;a href=&#34;#other-witness-accounts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents accounts from other witnesses to the event. Passengers on Bowyer&amp;rsquo;s aircraft reported seeing the light, with one describing it as &amp;ldquo;sunlight-colored&amp;rdquo; and another as &amp;ldquo;an orange light … like an elongated oval.&amp;rdquo; Patrick Patterson, a pilot from Blue Islands, also reported seeing a similar object in the same general location. The section also mentions an interpretation that the sighting was an atmospheric phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;proposed-explanations&#34;&gt;Proposed explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#proposed-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the UFO sighting. Bowyer rejected the idea that he saw an alien vessel, but considered the possibility of earthquake lights related to the earthquake in south-eastern England that occurred shortly after the sighting. A local astronomer, Michael Maunder, suggested that the sighting could be attributed to sun dogs, an optical phenomenon caused by the refraction of light through ice crystals. He noted that the weather conditions were favorable for sun dogs and that the reported lights were approximately 22 degrees from the sun, consistent with the appearance of sun dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UFO reports and atomic sites</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_415176c4b3ae/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:49:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;correlation-between-ufo-reports-and-atomic-sites&#34;&gt;Correlation between UFO reports and atomic sites &lt;a href=&#34;#correlation-between-ufo-reports-and-atomic-sites&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the historical and statistical connections between reports of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and locations associated with atomic technology, primarily in the United States. It examines how early speculation linked UFO sightings to atomic sites, the influence of the Cold War, and various incidents and studies that have fueled this correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section establishes the context for the link between UFO reports and atomic sites. It highlights the increased scrutiny of US airspace due to national security concerns in 1947, coinciding with increased media coverage of UFO reports. It notes that the development of atomic weapons and long-range vehicles meant that even a small number of adversarial overflights could have significant national security implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1940s-weapons-development&#34;&gt;1940s weapons development &lt;a href=&#34;#1940s-weapons-development&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the development of atomic weapons by the US during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. Key locations mentioned are Oak Ridge, Tennessee (uranium enrichment), Hanford, Washington (plutonium production), and Los Alamos, New Mexico (bomb design and construction). It also discusses the increased lethality and range of air power during the war and Japan&amp;rsquo;s deployment of intercontinental balloon bombs, one of which interfered with plutonium production at Hanford. The US&amp;rsquo;s Project Mogul, inspired by the Japanese balloons, aimed to detect Soviet atomic tests. The section also mentions German advancements in rockets, jet fighters, and bomber designs, which both the US and Soviet governments learned about and utilized after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;increased-scrutiny-of-us-airspace&#34;&gt;Increased scrutiny of US airspace &lt;a href=&#34;#increased-scrutiny-of-us-airspace&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains how the possibility of a Soviet atomic attack led to increased surveillance of US airspace, particularly around atomic facilities. It mentions the development of the first intercontinental bomber, the Convair B-36 Peacemaker, which could reach the Soviet Union from American soil. Atomic sites were among the first locations in the US to operate radar, supported by visual spotters and fighter squadrons. The start of the Cold War in 1947 influenced media coverage of UFO reports, treating them as potential national security threats rather than folklore or tall tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents a timeline of notable UFO incidents and their connection to atomic sites, starting in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;supposed-flying-discs-allegedly-break-sound-barrier&#34;&gt;Supposed flying discs allegedly break sound barrier &lt;a href=&#34;#supposed-flying-discs-allegedly-break-sound-barrier&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the Kenneth Arnold sighting in June 1947, where he reported seeing nine objects flying at supersonic speeds near Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in Washington state. The proximity of this sighting to the Hanford plutonium plant led to media speculation about a connection. The section also notes that the sound barrier was not officially broken until October 1947 by Chuck Yeager, and the Air Force initially denied the achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roswell-and-atomic-weapons&#34;&gt;Roswell and atomic weapons &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-and-atomic-weapons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the Roswell incident in July 1947, where debris was found on a ranch near Corona, New Mexico. The 509th at Roswell was the Army&amp;rsquo;s atomic bomb group. The initial explanation of a weather balloon was later questioned, and the Air Force eventually concluded the debris came from a Project Mogul balloon designed to detect Soviet atomic tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;public-claims-of-link-to-atomic-sites&#34;&gt;Public claims of link to atomic sites &lt;a href=&#34;#public-claims-of-link-to-atomic-sites&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the public&amp;rsquo;s perception of a link between flying discs and atomic weaponry in 1947. It mentions headlines claiming a connection between &amp;ldquo;discs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;atom products,&amp;rdquo; citing an unnamed scientist from the Manhattan Project who suggested experiments in atomic energy transmutation were responsible for the sightings. The Hanford works were also mentioned as a location with numerous UFO reports. Atomic scientists Harold Urey and David E. Lilienthal dismissed these claims as &amp;ldquo;gibberish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mantell-crash-near-oak-ridge&#34;&gt;Mantell crash near Oak Ridge &lt;a href=&#34;#mantell-crash-near-oak-ridge&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Mantell incident in January 1948, where Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a pilot from Fort Knox, Kentucky, crashed while pursuing a UFO near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Air Force later attributed the UFO to a Skyhook balloon, a classified project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;green-fireballs-near-hanford&#34;&gt;Green Fireballs near Hanford &lt;a href=&#34;#green-fireballs-near-hanford&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses reports of green fireballs near Hanford, Washington, starting in December 1948. It mentions Lincoln LaPaz&amp;rsquo;s investigation of these reports and the issuance of orders to fire on potentially hostile aircraft over Hanford and Oak Ridge. The section also notes UFO reports over Hanford and Oak Ridge during the early days of the Korean War and a 1952 Life Magazine article reporting unusual radar returns near an atomic installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contactees-and-nuclear-war&#34;&gt;Contactees and nuclear war &lt;a href=&#34;#contactees-and-nuclear-war&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the theme of nuclear war in UFO culture. The 1951 film &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; featured a benevolent spaceman warning about atomic weapons. George Adamski began claiming contact with &amp;ldquo;space brothers&amp;rdquo; concerned about atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;big-sur-missile-test&#34;&gt;Big Sur missile test &lt;a href=&#34;#big-sur-missile-test&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a reported UFO incident during a 1964 Air Force missile test near Big Sur, California. Robert Jacobs, who oversaw the team, claimed a UFO interfered with the test. Kingston George, the project engineer, argued the team had actually recorded the release of decoy warheads and chaff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;malmstrom-missile-malfunction&#34;&gt;Malmstrom missile malfunction &lt;a href=&#34;#malmstrom-missile-malfunction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses UFO reports over a missile complex in March 1967 during a routine malfunction. Retired Air Force personnel later claimed the weapons failure was caused by a UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hynek-suggests-atomic-link&#34;&gt;Hynek suggests atomic link &lt;a href=&#34;#hynek-suggests-atomic-link&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section notes that astronomer J. Allen Hynek, initially hired by the Air Force to debunk UFO reports, began speculating in 1968 that UFOs might be related to an unknown phenomenon connected to nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rendelsham&#34;&gt;Rendelsham &lt;a href=&#34;#rendelsham&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the Rendlesham Forest incident in December 1980, a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights near RAF Woodbridge in England, which was used by the United States Air Force (USAF). USAF personnel, including Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt, claimed to see things they described as a UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers more recent developments, including a legend that the 1945 Trinity atomic bomb test brought down an alien spacecraft. It mentions Robert Hastings&amp;rsquo; book &lt;em&gt;UFOs &amp;amp; Nukes: Extraordinary Encounters at Nuclear Weapons Sites&lt;/em&gt; and claims by former AATIP director Luis Elizondo and former U.S. Air Force personnel that UAPs have interfered with nuclear capabilities. It also notes reports of UFOs interfering with other major powers&amp;rsquo; nuclear weapons systems. The section mentions the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act requesting more information on UAP incidents associated with military nuclear assets and claims by Robert L. Salas and Robert Hastings of alien abduction. Finally, it mentions that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission will raise the issue of UAP with its United States counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;statistical-studies&#34;&gt;Statistical studies &lt;a href=&#34;#statistical-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the statistical evidence for a correlation between UFO reports and atomic sites, considering the possibility of observational bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It introduces the concept of the &amp;ldquo;streetlight effect,&amp;rdquo; where observations are more likely to be reported where observations are most likely to occur. Mainstream experts argue that increased scrutiny of airspace around strategically important facilities explains the correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section mentions a rudimentary spatial analysis conducted by Air Force officers in the 1950s, which found that UFOs were seen more frequently around areas vital to US defense, such as Los Alamos-Albuquerque, Oak Ridge, and White Sands Proving Ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 study of UFO reports in France concluded that there was a statistically significant link between nuclear activities and unexplained UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 document from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence suggested that clustering of UFO reports around US training and testing grounds might be due to &amp;ldquo;collection bias as a result of focused attention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study examined a National UFO Reporting Center dataset and found that UFO reports are more frequent in areas with darker nighttime skies and &amp;ldquo;wide-open spaces.&amp;rdquo; Additionally, analysis suggested that proximity to airports and military installations was linked to increased UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;european-mission-to-study-comet-67pchuryumov-gerasimenko-20042016&#34;&gt;European mission to study Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (2004–2016) &lt;a href=&#34;#european-mission-to-study-comet-67pchuryumov-gerasimenko-20042016&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; mission, a European Space Agency (ESA) project launched in 2004 to study Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. It highlights that &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt;, along with its lander module &lt;em&gt;Philae&lt;/em&gt;, conducted a detailed study of the comet. The mission involved flybys of Earth, Mars, and asteroids 21 Lutetia and 2867 Šteins. It was the third cornerstone mission of ESA&amp;rsquo;s Horizon 2000 program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mission-overview&#34;&gt;Mission overview &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a summary of the &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; mission&amp;rsquo;s timeline and objectives. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch on March 2, 2004, from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrival at Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on May 7, 2014, and entering orbit on August 6, 2014, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Philae&lt;/em&gt; lander&amp;rsquo;s successful landing on the comet nucleus on November 12, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of communication with &lt;em&gt;Philae&lt;/em&gt; due to battery power depletion, with brief restoration in June and July 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End of mission on September 30, 2016, with &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; hard-landing on the comet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mention of the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, as the control center and the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) near Madrid, Spain, for scientific payload planning and data management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated involvement of 2,000 people in the mission over a decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the background and naming of the &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; mission. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mission evolved from earlier cooperative efforts between ESA and NASA, including the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Comet Nucleus Sample Return (CNSR) missions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NASA&amp;rsquo;s cancellation of CRAF led ESA to develop a similar project independently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mission was redesigned due to budgetary constraints, resembling the cancelled CRAF mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gerhard Schwehm was the mission manager until his retirement in March 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mission included generational team management for continuity and knowledge transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The probe was named after the Rosetta Stone, and the lander after the Philae obelisk, symbolizing the deciphering of cometary composition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spacecraft carried a micro-etched nickel prototype of the Rosetta disc with language translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mission-firsts&#34;&gt;Mission firsts &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-firsts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the groundbreaking achievements of the &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; mission. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First European close encounter with asteroids in the asteroid belt.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Contact (1985 novel)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_aadcaf1f76f6/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;contact-1985-novel&#34;&gt;Contact (1985 novel) &lt;a href=&#34;#contact-1985-novel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article provides information about Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 science fiction novel, &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;. It distinguishes the novel from other works with the same title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot centers around Eleanor &amp;ldquo;Ellie&amp;rdquo; Arroway, a scientist with a strong aptitude for science and mathematics. Her father&amp;rsquo;s death deeply affects her, and she finds herself at odds with her stepfather. Ellie pursues a career in radio astronomy, eventually directing Project Argus, a SETI initiative in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project detects a signal from Vega, which is analyzed and found to contain a retransmission of Hitler&amp;rsquo;s 1936 Olympic speech. Later, a third message reveals plans for an advanced machine. Ellie works with Ken der Heer and Vaygay Lunacharsky to decipher the message. Religious leaders Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss also become involved. The final piece of the message is discovered with the help of S.R. Hadden, revealing the primer needed to build the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A race to build the machine ensues between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. An extremist bombing delays the project. Ellie learns Hadden has secretly built a third machine in Hokkaido, Japan. Ellie, Vaygay, Devi Sukhavati, Abonnema Eda, and Xi Qiaomu travel through wormholes to a station near the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s center. There, they meet extraterrestrials who explain their motives and a project to alter the universe&amp;rsquo;s properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to Earth, the travelers find their journey seemingly took no time at all. Their video recordings are erased, and officials suspect a hoax. Ellie finds evidence of her journey in the digits of pi, confirming the reality of her experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publication-history&#34;&gt;Publication history &lt;a href=&#34;#publication-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, Sagan was inspired by science fiction and fantasy. He preferred realistic stories that helped readers understand real science and history. In 1978, Sagan predicted that science fiction would make young people interested in extraterrestrial contact. Simon &amp;amp; Schuster gave Sagan a $2 million advance on the novel in 1981. Kip Thorne provided Sagan with ideas on wormholes. Eleanor Arroway was named after Eleanor Roosevelt and Voltaire. The character is based on Jill Tarter. The novel won the Locus Award for Best First Novel in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First contact (science fiction)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_2ec54f2d6fb4/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 03:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_2ec54f2d6fb4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-contact-science-fiction&#34;&gt;First Contact (Science Fiction) &lt;a href=&#34;#first-contact-science-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact is a recurring theme in science fiction, exploring the initial meeting between humans and extraterrestrial life or any sentient species from different planets or natural satellites. It draws parallels with the anthropological concept of first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept dates back to the 2nd century AD with Lucian of Samosata&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A True Story&lt;/em&gt;. Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Le Micromégas&lt;/em&gt; (1752) features an alien from Sirius visiting Earth and engaging in philosophical discussions with humans. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; is traditionally credited with popularizing the trope of conflict between humans and alien intelligent species, although earlier examples exist, such as &lt;em&gt;Les Xipéhuz&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1950s saw a surge in first contact stories in the United States, often reflecting Cold War anxieties about nuclear holocaust or communist invasion. Films like &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; (1951) began to portray first contact as potentially beneficial, while &lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/em&gt; (1956) reflected fears of communist infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt; depicts both positive and negative consequences of first contact, while Stanisław Lem&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Solaris&lt;/em&gt; explores the futility of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise introduced the Prime Directive, a non-interference regulation, which has since become a common trope in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later works include &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; (1977), Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; (1985), and novels like &lt;em&gt;The Sparrow&lt;/em&gt; (1996) and &lt;em&gt;The Three-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt; (2006). Films like &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; (2016) focus on the linguistic challenges of first contact. &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; (2021) depicts an unintended first contact scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-and-themes&#34;&gt;Types and Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#types-and-themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact stories vary widely in their methods of contact and the nature of the subsequent interaction. These variations include positive vs. negative outcomes, physical meetings vs. message interception, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien invasion is a common early trope, popularized by &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. During the Cold War, these stories often reflected American anxieties about the Soviet Union, with infiltration narratives being a variation on the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-artifacts&#34;&gt;Alien Artifacts &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-artifacts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bracewell probes, hypothesized by Ronald N. Bracewell, are extraterrestrial artifacts that allow real-time communication. Big Dumb Objects, such as megastructures like ringworlds, are a common variation. &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; features mysterious black Monoliths that enhance technological progress. Stories also involve finding alien spacecraft, such as in &lt;em&gt;Rendezvous with Rama&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication-with-alien-intelligence&#34;&gt;Communication with Alien Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#communication-with-alien-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stories deal with the challenges of communication. Stanisław Lem&amp;rsquo;s works often portray mutual understanding between humans and aliens as impossible, criticizing the idea of cognitive universality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;message-from-space&#34;&gt;Message from Space &lt;a href=&#34;#message-from-space&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact may occur through the detection of an extraterrestrial signal or technosignature. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) began with the advent of radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alien-languages&#34;&gt;Alien Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages are a common form of communication with aliens, and many stories explore language issues. While space operas often use universal translators, hard science fiction typically depicts the difficulties of communicating with aliens, which can lead to misunderstandings and even war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ethics-of-first-contact&#34;&gt;Ethics of First Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#ethics-of-first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many writers have considered how humans should treat aliens upon first contact. The Prime Directive of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; is a notable example of non-interference. In Soviet science fiction, &amp;ldquo;progressors&amp;rdquo; worked clandestinely to improve less advanced civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-examples&#34;&gt;Notable Examples &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-examples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-the-earth-stood-still&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-day-the-earth-stood-still&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the short story &amp;ldquo;Farewell to the Master,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; depicts the arrival of Klaatu and Gort in Washington, D.C. Humanity&amp;rsquo;s hostile response to first contact is used as an allegory for the Second Red Scare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-third-kind&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1977 film by Steven Spielberg tells the story of Roy Neary, whose life changes after an encounter with a UFO. The film was deemed &amp;ldquo;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&amp;rdquo; by the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 novel, later adapted into a film, depicts the reception of a radio signal from Vega and the construction of a Machine based on the message&amp;rsquo;s specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;star-trek&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact is central to Starfleet operations in the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise. The Prime Directive is a foundational regulation, though it is frequently violated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-the-original-series&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-the-original-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original pilot episode features the Talosians. The Prime Directive was introduced in &amp;ldquo;The Return of the Archons&amp;rdquo; to prevent negative consequences from contact with technologically inferior societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-the-next-generation&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-the-next-generation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot episode, &amp;ldquo;Encounter at Farpoint,&amp;rdquo; depicts first contact with the Q Continuum. Episodes like &amp;ldquo;Who Watches the Watchers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; center on the Prime Directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;star-trek-first-contact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#star-trek-first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1996 film portrays first contact between humans and Vulcans, leading to the formation of the United Federation of Planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-war-of-the-worlds&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-war-of-the-worlds&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; novel details a conflict between humankind and Martians. It has been adapted into numerous films, radio dramas, and other media. The 1938 radio drama, directed by Orson Welles, reportedly caused panic among listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cultural-impact-of-extraterrestrial-contact&#34;&gt;Cultural Impact of Extraterrestrial Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-impact-of-extraterrestrial-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the potential changes to human society, science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems that could result from contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. It emphasizes that the nature and magnitude of these changes would depend on factors such as the extraterrestrial civilization&amp;rsquo;s technological advancement, intentions (benevolent or malevolent), and the level of mutual understanding between the two species. The article also draws parallels to historical encounters between vastly different human cultures on Earth, such as the Columbian Exchange, and encounters between native and invasive species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section sets the stage by introducing the concept of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and its relationship to analyzing the implications of contact. It highlights that SETI focuses on locating intelligent life, while this article focuses on the potential consequences of such contact. It acknowledges that tragic consequences are largely speculative due to the absence of verified public contact to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the efforts to detect extraterrestrial civilizations using radio telescopes. It mentions the challenge of identifying artificial signals against the background of natural radio waves. Key locations and projects mentioned include the Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California, the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China, the now-demolished Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Project Cyclops commissioned by NASA, and Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI). The section also discusses the discovery of numerous extrasolar planets, including potentially habitable ones like Kepler-22b, and the renewed government interest in funding SETI programs, such as the European Space Agency&amp;rsquo;s COROT and NASA&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Kepler&lt;/em&gt; space observatory. Projects like A Message From Earth (AMFE) and SETILive are also mentioned, along with alternative search methods like SEVENDIP at the University of California, Berkeley. The section concludes by acknowledging that while several signals, such as the Wow! signal, have been detected, none have been confirmed as being of intelligent origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impact-assessment&#34;&gt;Impact Assessment &lt;a href=&#34;#impact-assessment&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses methods for assessing the potential impact of extraterrestrial contact. It introduces the Rio scale, which provides a quantitative picture of the results of extraterrestrial contact based on factors such as the method of discovery, the information content of messages, and the nature of the extraterrestrial beings. The section also mentions a study by astronomer Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory, which analyzes events of similar significance in the history of science to predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received and distinguishes between short-term and long-term impacts. The section also discusses the importance of physical distance between civilizations, with closer contact likely to be more disruptive. It also mentions a poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000, which provides factor analysis of responses to questions about the participants&amp;rsquo; belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The section concludes by mentioning a survey by psychologists Douglas Vakoch and Yuh-shiow Lee to assess people&amp;rsquo;s reactions to receiving a message from extraterrestrials, including their judgments about likelihood that extraterrestrials would be malevolent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-detection-protocols&#34;&gt;Post-Detection Protocols &lt;a href=&#34;#post-detection-protocols&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the protocols that have been developed to guide scientists and governments in the event of extraterrestrial contact. It emphasizes that these protocols are not legally binding and are likely to be ignored if contact occurs. The section mentions the &amp;ldquo;Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence,&amp;rdquo; created by the SETI Permanent Committee of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and endorsed by various international scientific unions. The Declaration of Principles contains broad provisions, including verification of the signal&amp;rsquo;s intelligent origin, communication with other signatories of the Declaration, informing national authorities, informing the astronomical community, making news of the discovery public, publishing all data, minimizing terrestrial use of the electromagnetic frequency bands, and not responding to the signal without international agreement. The section also mentions a separate &amp;ldquo;Proposed Agreement on the Sending of Communications to Extraterrestrial Intelligence,&amp;rdquo; which proposes an international commission to decide whether to send a message and determine its contents. The section concludes by noting that Paul Davies, a member of the SETI Post-Detection Taskgroup, believes that post-detection protocols are unlikely to be followed by astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contact-scenarios-and-considerations&#34;&gt;Contact Scenarios and Considerations &lt;a href=&#34;#contact-scenarios-and-considerations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores various models of interaction between extraterrestrial and human civilizations, ranging from beneficial collaborations to hostile subjugation. It highlights the importance of the extraterrestrial civilization&amp;rsquo;s level of aggressiveness, ethics, and biological compatibility with humans. The section also considers whether contact is via signals or physical probes, and the impact of mutual comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friendly-civilizations&#34;&gt;Friendly Civilizations &lt;a href=&#34;#friendly-civilizations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses potential interactions with benevolent extraterrestrial civilizations. It mentions Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, who suggests that advanced civilizations might share knowledge such as a physical theory of everything, zero-point energy, or faster-than-light travel. The section also mentions Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, who suggests that cooperative civilizations are more likely to aid humanity. In contrast, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, takes the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile. The section also discusses Allen Tough&amp;rsquo;s suggestions for how a friendly civilization might help humanity, including intervention to avert catastrophe, advice and action with consent, and forcible corrective action. The section concludes by noting that even with friendly contact, humans could suffer from a loss of identity and confidence, and that a friendly civilization may avoid contact altogether to allow natural development, known as the zoo hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hostile-civilizations&#34;&gt;Hostile Civilizations &lt;a href=&#34;#hostile-civilizations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the potential dangers of contact with aggressive extraterrestrial civilizations. It notes that while science fiction often depicts humans successfully repelling alien invasions, scientists generally believe that a technologically advanced civilization could easily destroy human civilization. The section mentions operations that are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers on a planet, bombarding a planet with deadly neutron radiation, or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay waste to it, may be important tools for a hostile civilization. The section also discusses the views of Carl Sagan, who believed that a civilization capable of interstellar travel would have transcended war, and Seth Shostak, who argues that limited resources would cultivate aggression. Ragbir Bhathal claims that an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity in a similar manner to the European colonization of much of the rest of the world. The section also mentions David Brin, who states that while an extraterrestrial civilization may have an imperative to act for no benefit to itself, it would be naïve to suggest that such a trait would be prevalent throughout the galaxy. The section concludes by noting that humans may be an unsuitable food source for extraterrestrials due to biochemical differences, and that transmitting intentional signals may not increase the risk of invasion, as any civilization capable of interstellar travel could already detect Earth&amp;rsquo;s accidental radio leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equally-advanced-and-more-advanced-civilizations&#34;&gt;Equally Advanced and More Advanced Civilizations &lt;a href=&#34;#equally-advanced-and-more-advanced-civilizations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the implications of contact with civilizations of similar or greater technological advancement. It mentions Robert Freitas&amp;rsquo; speculation that the technological advancement and energy usage of a civilization, measured by its rating on the Kardashev scale, may play an important role in the result of extraterrestrial contact. The section also discusses Ben Finney&amp;rsquo;s comparison of the situation to the cargo cults of New Guinea, where indigenous people misunderstood European technology. The section concludes by noting that John Billingham suggests that a civilization which is far more technologically advanced than humanity is also likely to be culturally and ethically advanced, and would therefore be unlikely to conduct astroengineering projects that would harm human civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interstellar-groups-of-civilizations&#34;&gt;Interstellar Groups of Civilizations &lt;a href=&#34;#interstellar-groups-of-civilizations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the possibility of &amp;ldquo;galactic clubs,&amp;rdquo; groupings of civilizations from across the galaxy. It mentions Albert Harrison&amp;rsquo;s surmise that such clubs might exist, beginning as loose confederations and eventually developing into powerful unions. The section also discusses Sebastian von Hoerner&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that entry into a galactic club may be a way for humanity to handle the culture shock arising from contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. The section concludes by noting that Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that an interstellar grouping of civilizations might take the form of an empire, which need not necessarily be a force for evil, but may provide for peace and security throughout its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-artifacts&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Artifacts &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-artifacts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the possibility of extraterrestrial civilizations communicating through artifacts or probes rather than radio. It notes that probes can hold sustained dialogues and perform surveillance, and that Allen Tough speculates that the enormous amount of energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. The section also mentions Robert Freitas&amp;rsquo; reasons why interstellar probes may be a preferred method of communication, including the ability to survey non-intelligent populations, store information for long timescales, and emit strong, unambiguous signals. The section concludes by noting that given the age of the Milky Way galaxy, an ancient extraterrestrial civilization may have existed and sent probes to the Solar System millions or even billions of years before the evolution of &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-implications-of-contact&#34;&gt;Further Implications of Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#further-implications-of-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the potential theological, political, legal, scientific, technological, ethical, ecological, and biological-warfare impacts of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;theological&#34;&gt;Theological &lt;a href=&#34;#theological&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-seti&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-seti&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) encompasses various scientific projects aimed at detecting signals or evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth. These efforts involve monitoring electromagnetic radiation, searching for optical signals, and investigating potential extraterrestrial artifacts. Some initiatives, like NASA&amp;rsquo;s Golden Record, have also attempted to send messages to hypothetical alien civilizations. Despite decades of searching, no confirmed evidence of alien intelligence has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the historical progression of SETI efforts, from early speculations to modern scientific projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-work&#34;&gt;Early Work &lt;a href=&#34;#early-work&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early searches for extraterrestrial intelligence within the Solar System are highlighted. Nikola Tesla suggested using his wireless electrical transmission system to contact beings on Mars in 1896. In 1899, he thought he detected a signal from Mars at his Colorado Springs experimental station. Guglielmo Marconi, Lord Kelvin, and David Peck Todd also believed radio could be used to contact Martians in the early 1900s. In 1924, during a close opposition of Mars, the United States observed a &amp;ldquo;National Radio Silence Day&amp;rdquo; to listen for Martian signals, with William F. Friedman assigned to translate any potential messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-ozma-and-early-radio-astronomy&#34;&gt;Project Ozma and Early Radio Astronomy &lt;a href=&#34;#project-ozma-and-early-radio-astronomy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of searching the microwave spectrum was first pointed out in a 1959 paper by Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi. In 1960, Frank Drake performed the first modern SETI experiment, Project Ozma, at Green Bank, West Virginia, examining the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. Soviet scientists also took a strong interest in SETI during the 1960s. Iosif Shklovsky wrote the book &lt;em&gt;Universe, Life, Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; (1962), which was expanded upon by Carl Sagan as &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966). John D. Kraus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Ear&amp;rdquo; radio telescope at Ohio State University began the world&amp;rsquo;s first continuous SETI program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-cyclops-and-the-wow-signal&#34;&gt;Project Cyclops and the Wow! Signal &lt;a href=&#34;#project-cyclops-and-the-wow-signal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, NASA funded a SETI study that proposed the construction of an Earth-based radio telescope array with 1,500 dishes known as Project Cyclops. The project was not built, but the report formed the basis of much SETI work that followed. The Ohio State SETI program gained fame on August 15, 1977, when Jerry Ehman witnessed a strong signal, the Wow! signal, which is considered by some to be the best candidate for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source ever discovered. In May 2023, a test extraterrestrial signal was transmitted to radio telescopes on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sentinel-meta-and-beta&#34;&gt;Sentinel, META, and BETA &lt;a href=&#34;#sentinel-meta-and-beta&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman founded the U.S. Planetary Society, partly as a vehicle for SETI studies. In the early 1980s, Harvard University physicist Paul Horowitz proposed the design of a spectrum analyzer specifically intended to search for SETI transmissions. This work led to &amp;ldquo;Suitcase SETI&amp;rdquo; in 1981, followed by Project META in 1985, and Project BETA in 1995. On March 23, 1999, the 26-meter radio telescope on which Sentinel, META and BETA were based was blown over by strong winds and seriously damaged, forcing the BETA project to cease operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mop-and-project-phoenix&#34;&gt;MOP and Project Phoenix &lt;a href=&#34;#mop-and-project-phoenix&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, the NASA SETI program was heavily criticized by Senator William Proxmire, and funding for SETI research was removed from the NASA budget by Congress in 1981. In 1992, the U.S. government funded an operational SETI program, in the form of the NASA Microwave Observing Program (MOP). MOP was canceled one year after its start. In 1995, the SETI Institute resurrected the MOP program under the name of Project Phoenix, under the direction of Jill Tarter. From 1995 through March 2004, Phoenix conducted observations at the Parkes radio telescope in Australia, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ongoing-radio-searches&#34;&gt;Ongoing Radio Searches &lt;a href=&#34;#ongoing-radio-searches&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the current state of radio-based SETI projects and the rationale behind focusing on radio frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many radio frequencies penetrate Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere well, leading to the development of radio telescopes. Human endeavors emit considerable electromagnetic radiation, which could be recognizable as artificial signals. Earth has been sending radio waves into space for over 100 years, reaching over 1,000 stars. Many international radio telescopes are currently being used for radio SETI searches, including the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Australia, and the Lovell Telescope in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;allen-telescope-array&#34;&gt;Allen Telescope Array &lt;a href=&#34;#allen-telescope-array&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SETI Institute collaborated with the Radio Astronomy Laboratory at the Berkeley SETI Research Center to develop the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). The array has 42 operational dishes at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in rural northern California. The SETI Institute&amp;rsquo;s Center for SETI Research (CSR) uses ATA in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, observing 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Berkeley astronomers used the ATA to pursue several science topics until 2011, when the collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley and the SETI Institute was terminated. In 2012, the ATA was revitalized with a donation by Franklin Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;serendip&#34;&gt;SERENDIP &lt;a href=&#34;#serendip&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SERENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) is a SETI program launched in 1979 by the Berkeley SETI Research Center. SERENDIP analyzes deep space radio telescope data that it obtains while other astronomers are using the telescopes. The most recently deployed SERENDIP spectrometer, SERENDIP VI, was installed at both the Arecibo Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope in 2014–2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breakthrough-listen&#34;&gt;Breakthrough Listen &lt;a href=&#34;#breakthrough-listen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breakthrough Listen&lt;/em&gt; is a ten-year initiative with $100 million funding begun in July 2015 to actively search for intelligent extraterrestrial communications in the universe. The science program for Breakthrough Listen is based at Berkeley SETI Research Center. The project is observing for thousands of hours every year on two major radio telescopes, the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, and the Parkes Observatory in Australia. Frank Drake was one of the scientists on the project&amp;rsquo;s advisory committee. In October 2019, Breakthrough Listen started a collaboration with scientists from the TESS team to look for signs of advanced extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fast&#34;&gt;FAST &lt;a href=&#34;#fast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s 500 meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) lists &lt;em&gt;detecting interstellar communication signals&lt;/em&gt; as part of its science mission. FAST is the first radio observatory built with SETI as a core scientific goal. On 14 June 2022, astronomers, working with China&amp;rsquo;s FAST telescope, reported the possibility of having detected artificial signals, but cautioned that further studies were required to determine if a natural radio interference may be the source. Dan Werthimer noted, &amp;ldquo;These signals are from radio interference; they are due to radio pollution from earthlings, not from E.T.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ucla&#34;&gt;UCLA &lt;a href=&#34;#ucla&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) undergraduate and graduate students have been participating in radio searches for technosignatures with the Green Bank Telescope. Targets include the Kepler field, TRAPPIST-1, and solar-type stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;community-seti-projects&#34;&gt;Community SETI Projects &lt;a href=&#34;#community-seti-projects&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights SETI projects that rely on the contributions of volunteers and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setihome&#34;&gt;SETI@home &lt;a href=&#34;#setihome&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SETI@home project used volunteer computing to analyze signals acquired by the SERENDIP project. The SETI@home project was launched by the Berkeley SETI Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, in May 1999. The project is run by director David P. Anderson and chief scientist Dan Werthimer. On March 31, 2020, the project stopped sending out new work to SETI@home users, bringing this particular SETI effort to an indefinite hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seti-net&#34;&gt;SETI Net &lt;a href=&#34;#seti-net&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SETI Network was the only fully operational private search system. SETI Net started operation in the early 1980s as a way to learn about the science of the search, and developed several software packages for the amateur SETI community. SETI Net went dark and was decommissioned on 2021-12-04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-seti-league-and-project-argus&#34;&gt;The SETI League and Project Argus &lt;a href=&#34;#the-seti-league-and-project-argus&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1994 in response to the United States Congress cancellation of the NASA SETI program, The SETI League, Incorporated is a membership-supported nonprofit organization. This grass-roots alliance of amateur and professional radio astronomers is headed by executive director emeritus H. Paul Shuch. The organization concentrates on coordinating a global network of small, amateur-built radio telescopes under Project Argus, an all-sky survey seeking to achieve real-time coverage of the entire sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optical-experiments&#34;&gt;Optical Experiments &lt;a href=&#34;#optical-experiments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extraterrestrial intelligence using optical wavelengths, such as lasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some SETI researchers have considered the possibility that alien civilizations might be using powerful lasers for interstellar communications at optical wavelengths. There are two problems with optical SETI: lasers are highly &amp;ldquo;monochromatic&amp;rdquo;, and lasers are highly directional&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-travis-walton-incident&#34;&gt;The Travis Walton Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#the-travis-walton-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Travis Walton incident is an alleged alien abduction that occurred on November 5, 1975, involving American forestry worker Travis Walton in the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests near Heber, Arizona. The incident is widely considered a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the alleged abduction, noting that in the early 1970s, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; tabloid offered a substantial prize for proof of extraterrestrial visitors, which may have motivated the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34;&gt;Travis Walton and the Turkey Springs forestry job &lt;a href=&#34;#travis-walton-and-the-turkey-springs-forestry-job&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the circumstances surrounding Travis Walton&amp;rsquo;s employment and the forestry contract. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; The forestry job was located in Turkey Springs, about 12 miles south of Heber, Arizona. The crew lived in Snowflake, 30 miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis Walton, his brother Duane, and crew chief Michael H. Rogers are central figures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Motive:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers&amp;rsquo;s forestry contract was behind schedule, potentially leading to financial penalties. The section notes that Walton had a prior criminal record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The Turkey Springs job involved thinning 1,277 acres by August 1975, later extended to November 10. Failure to complete the job could result in a $2,500 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Barney Hill and NBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#barney-hill-and-nbcs-the-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the potential influence of the 1975 NBC television movie &lt;em&gt;The UFO Incident&lt;/em&gt;, which dramatized the alleged abduction of Barney and Betty Hill. It suggests that the film may have inspired Walton and Rogers to fabricate their own abduction story. Skeptics and psychologists are quoted arguing that the film could have motivated someone to claim an abduction for attention. It also mentions that Travis Walton told his mother not to worry if he were ever abducted by aliens because he would return safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the events of November 5, 1975, when Michael H. Rogers reported Travis Walton missing. The crew claimed they saw a lit object near the roadway, Walton approached it, and was struck by a light. The crew drove away in fear and returned to find Walton and the object gone. The police were notified, and a search was initiated. Deputy Kenneth Coplan noted the calm reaction of Walton&amp;rsquo;s mother to the news of his disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-person-investigation&#34;&gt;Missing person investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-person-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the search efforts and initial investigation following Walton&amp;rsquo;s disappearance. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Party:&lt;/strong&gt; A search party of nearly 50 people scoured the Turkey Springs area without success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&amp;rsquo;s Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Law enforcement were surprised by the calm reaction of Travis&amp;rsquo;s mother, who believed he was no longer on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFO Interest:&lt;/strong&gt; It was revealed that Travis, Duane, and their mother were interested in UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers and the crew underwent polygraph examinations to determine if they had harmed Walton. Five were deemed truthful, while one was inconclusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act of God Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers discussed the Forestry contract and the potential for an &amp;ldquo;Act of God&amp;rdquo; clause to excuse the delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walton-returns&#34;&gt;Walton returns &lt;a href=&#34;#walton-returns&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes Walton&amp;rsquo;s reappearance and subsequent events. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton called his sister&amp;rsquo;s home from a payphone in Heber, Arizona, on November 12, shortly after midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deputy Glen Flake:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy Flake witnessed Duane Walton transferring fuel from one car to another after having forgotten to purchase gas before local stations closed. Flake did not reveal that they knew Travis had returned home, and Duane did not tell the deputy that Travis had been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Duane sought medical attention for Travis, consulting with a hypnotherapist and later two medical doctors who were also amateur UFO investigators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheriff Gillespie:&lt;/strong&gt; Sheriff Gillespie insisted on interviewing Travis, but Duane and Travis demanded that the interview not be recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; provided a suite at the Sheraton Inn in Scottsdale in exchange for exclusive access to Walton and his story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygraph Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis skipped a polygraph interview with police, but was later interviewed by Jack McCarthy a free-lance polygraph examiner arranged by a UFO group and the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;. McCarthy concluded that Travis was engaged in a &amp;ldquo;gross deception&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Television Interview:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton appeared on Phoenix television, claiming he lost consciousness and awoke in a hospital-like room with short, bald creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publicity-and-popular-culture&#34;&gt;Publicity and popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the media attention and cultural impact of the Walton incident. Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Enquirer Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for &amp;ldquo;best UFO case of the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism:&lt;/strong&gt; Skeptics, including Philip J. Klass, viewed the story as a hoax for financial gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book and Film:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton wrote &lt;em&gt;The Walton Experience&lt;/em&gt; in 1978, which was adapted into the 1993 film &lt;em&gt;Fire in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Appearances:&lt;/strong&gt; Walton has appeared at UFO conventions and on television, including &lt;em&gt;The Moment of Truth&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; podcast.&lt;/li&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 05:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_9c80ff0dfe5c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-life&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Life &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial life, also known as alien life, refers to life that originates from a world other than Earth. While no such life has been conclusively detected, it could range from simple prokaryotes to intelligent beings and civilizations. The science dedicated to studying extraterrestrial life is astrobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context &lt;a href=&#34;#context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a framework for understanding the topic of life in the universe. It outlines various aspects, including planetary habitability within and outside the Solar System, and lists celestial bodies like Venus, Mars, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan as potential locations for life. It also mentions the habitability of binary star systems, natural satellites, neutron star systems, red dwarf systems, K-type, yellow dwarf, and F-type main-sequence star systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;likelihood-of-existence&#34;&gt;Likelihood of Existence &lt;a href=&#34;#likelihood-of-existence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the debate on whether extraterrestrial life is common or rare. It presents the argument for ubiquitous life, citing the size and age of the universe, the abundance of life&amp;rsquo;s chemical elements, and the universality of physical laws. Scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are mentioned as proponents of this view, which is rooted in the Copernican and mediocrity principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the Rare Earth hypothesis suggests that life on Earth is due to a unique combination of factors, making extraterrestrial life, especially multicellular life, rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drake equation, devised by Frank Drake, is introduced as a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation considers factors like the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planets, and the likelihood of life evolving intelligence and developing communication technology. However, the section notes the controversy surrounding the Drake equation due to the speculative nature of its variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fermi paradox, the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for them, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biochemical-basis&#34;&gt;Biochemical Basis &lt;a href=&#34;#biochemical-basis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the potential biochemical requirements for extraterrestrial life. It states that life requires an environment with non-equilibrium thermodynamics, such as energy from stars, volcanoes, or hydrothermal vents. Liquid water is considered essential as a solvent for biochemical reactions, although alternatives like ammonia or liquid hydrocarbons are mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also explores alternative chemical elements that could form the basis of life, such as silicon, while acknowledging carbon&amp;rsquo;s versatility. It discusses the potential for radically different biochemistries, the role of natural selection, and the likelihood of cell membranes. Simon Conway Morris is mentioned for his views on convergent evolution leading to similar lifeforms as on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34;&gt;Harsh Environmental Conditions on Earth Harboring Life &lt;a href=&#34;#harsh-environmental-conditions-on-earth-harboring-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights that while conditions on other planets may seem too extreme to harbor life, some of the earliest life forms on Earth originated in extreme environments. Hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs are mentioned as possible origins of life on Earth. These environments support chemosynthetic processes, allowing organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon. The section suggests that similar processes could occur on other planets with reducing atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34;&gt;Planetary Habitability in the Solar System &lt;a href=&#34;#planetary-habitability-in-the-solar-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the potential for life on various bodies within our Solar System. Besides Earth, Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are identified as the most likely candidates. Venus is discussed as a terrestrial planet that evolved differently from Earth. Mars is considered potentially habitable in the past, with the possibility of fossilized remains or surviving microbes underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are mentioned as having subsurface oceans, with Europa being the most promising due to contact between its ocean and rocky surface. Enceladus is noted for its eruption columns releasing water into space, containing complex organic molecules, salts, and evidence of hydrothermal activity. Titan is unique for having liquid bodies of hydrocarbons on its surface, raising speculation about lifeforms with different biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-search&#34;&gt;Scientific Search &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-search&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces astrobiology as the science dedicated to searching for and studying life in the universe. It mentions the direct and indirect methods used, including the identification of thousands of exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-basic-life&#34;&gt;Search for Basic Life &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-basic-life&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for biosignatures within the Solar System and beyond. It mentions claims of evidence for microbial life on Mars, including structures resembling nanobacteria in the ALH84001 meteorite. The Viking Mars landers&amp;rsquo; gas emission experiments are discussed, along with NASA&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; rover&amp;rsquo;s mission to assess past and present habitability on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Cornell University are creating a catalog of microorganisms and their reactions to sunlight to aid in the search for similar organisms on exoplanets. The discovery of organic molecules in meteorites found in Antarctica is also mentioned, suggesting that building blocks of life may be generated within asteroids and comets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection of glycolaldehyde, a sugar molecule needed to form RNA, in a distant star system is highlighted as evidence that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to planet formation. The discovery of hydrogen cyanide in the plumes of Enceladus is also mentioned as a possible chemical essential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) through the detection of technosignatures, such as interstellar communications, atmospheric effects, and planetary-sized structures. Organizations like the SETI Institute are searching for radio waves and laser pulses. The use of artificial intelligence to analyze data is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential technosignatures include nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons, and light pollution. The Kardashev scale is introduced, suggesting that advanced civilizations may consume energy directly from their local star, creating detectable infrared radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extrasolar-planets&#34;&gt;Extrasolar Planets &lt;a href=&#34;#extrasolar-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for exoplanets that may be conducive to life, particularly terrestrial planets within habitable zones. It mentions the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, ranging in size from Earth-like to gas giants. The Kepler space telescope&amp;rsquo;s role in detecting candidate planets is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section notes that there is at least one planet on average per star, and about 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. Proxima Centauri b is mentioned as the nearest known exoplanet. The study of planetary habitability considers various factors in determining a planet&amp;rsquo;s suitability for hosting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-and-cultural-impact&#34;&gt;History and Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#history-and-cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical and cultural context of the extraterrestrial life debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosmic-pluralism&#34;&gt;Cosmic Pluralism &lt;a href=&#34;#cosmic-pluralism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the philosophical belief in numerous worlds beyond Earth that might harbor life. It traces the concept back to ancient Greek thinkers like Anaximander, Epicurus, and Aristotle. Epicurus believed that other worlds with their own animals and plants should exist, while Aristotle thought Earth was the only planet in the universe. Medieval Muslim writers like Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Baqir are mentioned for supporting cosmic pluralism based on the Qur&amp;rsquo;an.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-modern-period&#34;&gt;Early Modern Period &lt;a href=&#34;#early-modern-period&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the shift in understanding the cosmos during the Copernican Revolution. Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that planets revolve around the sun, Johannes Kepler discovered that orbits were ellipses, and Galileo Galilei&amp;rsquo;s telescope provided further evidence. Giordano Bruno argued for an infinite universe with every star surrounded by its own planetary system. Isaac Newton&amp;rsquo;s theory of gravity further strengthened the heliocentric model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;19th-century&#34;&gt;19th Century &lt;a href=&#34;#19th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the increased speculation about life on Mars in the late 19th century, fueled by telescopic observations of apparent Martian canals. Percival Lowell published books proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization. Spectroscopic analysis by William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the Martian atmosphere. Louis Pasteur disproved the theory of spontaneous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recent-history&#34;&gt;Recent History &lt;a href=&#34;#recent-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the emergence of astrobiology as a science. It mentions the influence of science fiction on popular perception and the emergence of pseudosciences like ufology and the ancient astronauts hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis White Beck&amp;rsquo;s analysis of philosophical thought on extraterrestrial life is mentioned. The section notes that while no extraterrestrial life has been found, scientific reasons and technological advances suggest that it can exist elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Drake&amp;rsquo;s optimism about finding alien life is contrasted with Jacques Monod&amp;rsquo;s pessimism. Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee&amp;rsquo;s Rare Earth hypothesis is introduced, claiming that Earth-like life is rare in the universe. Stephen Hawking warned against contacting alien life forms, citing the potential for exploitation. Yuri Milner and the SETI Institute launched the Breakthrough Initiatives to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;government-responses&#34;&gt;Government Responses &lt;a href=&#34;#government-responses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses government policies related to extraterrestrial life. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement define rules of planetary protection. COSPAR also provides guidelines for planetary protection. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs discussed strategies for interacting with extraterrestrial life, but ended without conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is mentioned for its mission to prevent backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life. The Chinese government&amp;rsquo;s space program includes the search for extraterrestrial life. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency, stated that the search for extraterrestrial life is a main goal of deep space research. The French space agency (CNES) has an office for the study of &amp;ldquo;non-identified aero spatial phenomena&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-fiction&#34;&gt;In Fiction &lt;a href=&#34;#in-fiction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the portrayal of extraterrestrials in fiction. Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s theory of evolution influenced science fiction authors to create bizarre aliens distinct from humans. The Barney and Betty Hill incident, the first recorded claim of an alien abduction, influenced the grey alien archetype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the alleged UFO sighting by private pilot Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947, near Mount Rainier, Washington. This sighting is considered a seminal event in the modern history of UFOs, as it garnered nationwide news coverage and popularized the terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying disc.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sighting&#34;&gt;Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold, while flying from Chehalis to Yakima, Washington, detoured to search for a crashed U.S. Marine Corps C-46 transport plane near Mount Rainier. Near Mineral, Washington, at approximately 9,200 feet, Arnold observed nine shiny objects flying in formation past Mount Rainier. He estimated their speed to be over 1,200 miles per hour. Arnold described the objects as thin, flat, and convex, with one being crescent-shaped. He likened their movement to saucers skipping on water. The objects traveled from Mount Rainier to Mount Adams in 1 minute and 42 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arnold-shares-the-story&#34;&gt;Arnold Shares the Story &lt;a href=&#34;#arnold-shares-the-story&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After landing in Yakima, Arnold shared his experience with fellow pilots. He was interviewed by reporters from the &lt;em&gt;East Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; in Pendleton, Oregon, the next day. The reporters found Arnold to be a credible witness. Arnold expressed his desire to speak with the FBI due to the widespread attention and skepticism surrounding his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;corroboration&#34;&gt;Corroboration &lt;a href=&#34;#corroboration&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other individuals reported similar sightings around the same time as Arnold. L.G. Bernier of Richland, Washington, saw three objects flying towards Mount Rainier about half an hour before Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. Ethel Wheelhouse in Yakima, Washington, also reported seeing flying discs moving at high speeds. A member of the Washington State forest service reported seeing flashes over Mount Rainier at the same time as Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. Ten days later, a United Airlines crew over Idaho also spotted similar objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arnold-talks-of-possible-non-earthly-origins&#34;&gt;Arnold Talks of Possible Non-Earthly Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#arnold-talks-of-possible-non-earthly-origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early July 1947, Arnold discussed the possibility of extraterrestrial origins for the objects. He mentioned receiving fan mail with various interpretations, including visitations from another planet. Arnold expressed his hope that the devices were U.S. Army creations but also stated that if the government knew anything, the public should be informed. He also noted the objects&amp;rsquo; abrupt turns, suggesting they might be controlled from elsewhere, possibly another planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publicity-and-origins-of-term-flying-saucer&#34;&gt;Publicity and Origins of Term &amp;ldquo;Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-origins-of-term-flying-saucer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold&amp;rsquo;s account received widespread media coverage, appearing in numerous U.S. and Canadian newspapers. The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; became popular descriptors for UFOs following the sighting. While the exact origin of the terms is debated, it&amp;rsquo;s believed they emerged from early news stories about Arnold&amp;rsquo;s experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-term-appears&#34;&gt;The Term Appears &lt;a href=&#34;#the-term-appears&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspapers began using the terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; to describe the objects starting on June 26 and 27. The Arnold sighting is credited with popularizing these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bequette-interview&#34;&gt;Bequette Interview &lt;a href=&#34;#bequette-interview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, Arnold claimed he told Bill Bequette that the objects &amp;ldquo;flew erratic, like a saucer if you skip it across the water,&amp;rdquo; emphasizing the motion rather than the shape. Bequette&amp;rsquo;s initial articles described the objects as &amp;ldquo;saucer-like&amp;rdquo; and their motion as &amp;ldquo;like fish flipping in the sun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-investigation-of-arnold-story&#34;&gt;Military Investigation of Arnold Story &lt;a href=&#34;#military-investigation-of-arnold-story&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first investigation of Arnold&amp;rsquo;s claims was conducted by Lt. Frank Brown and Capt. William Davidson of Hamilton Field, California, on July 12. They concluded that Arnold likely saw what he reported. However, First Lt. Hal L. Eustace of the Army Air Corps described Arnold as &amp;ldquo;excitable&amp;rdquo; and his report as a &amp;ldquo;silly season episode.&amp;rdquo; The Army Air Force&amp;rsquo;s official conclusion was that the objects were due to a mirage. AAF intelligence, with FBI assistance, initiated a secret investigation of the best sightings, including Arnold&amp;rsquo;s. This led to the formation of Project Sign at the end of 1947, the first publicly acknowledged USAF UFO investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the weeks following Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting, numerous reports of similar objects flooded in from the U.S. and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skeptical-explanations&#34;&gt;Skeptical Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#skeptical-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at McChord Army Air Field suggested the objects could have been fast P-80 jets. Lieutenant Colonel Harry R. Turner of the White Sands Proving Ground also stated that Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting was consistent with jet airplanes. Steuart Campbell proposed that the objects were mirages of snow-capped peaks in the Cascade Range. Philip J. Klass argued that Arnold might have misidentified meteors. James Easton suggested that Arnold may have misidentified pelicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Menzel, a Harvard astronomer and UFO debunker, offered several explanations for Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting, including clouds of snow, orographic clouds, wave clouds, and spots of water on his airplane&amp;rsquo;s windows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-liquid-water&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Liquid Water &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-liquid-water&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial liquid water refers to water in its liquid state that occurs naturally outside of Earth. Its presence is considered a key prerequisite for life as we know it, making it a central focus in the search for extraterrestrial life. While many celestial bodies in the Solar System have a hydrosphere, Earth is the only one known to have stable bodies of liquid water on its surface. Confirmation of liquid water relies on absorption spectroscopy and geochemistry, which are effective for detecting water vapor and ice. However, detecting liquid water, especially subsurface water, is more challenging. Scientists use habitable zone theory, gravitational and tidal theory, planetary differentiation models, and radiometry to assess the potential for liquid water. Volcanic activity, fluvial features, and the presence of antifreeze agents also provide indirect evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;significance&#34;&gt;Significance &lt;a href=&#34;#significance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is essential for the biochemistry of all known life forms. While lifeforms on Earth have adapted to varying levels of water scarcity, no known lifeform can survive entirely without it. Water is a simple molecule, consisting of oxygen and hydrogen, found throughout the solar system. However, it is only useful for life in its liquid state, which is less common than water vapor or ice. Because the first life forms on Earth originated in liquid water, the search for extraterrestrial liquid water is closely linked to the search for extraterrestrial life. Liquid water&amp;rsquo;s unique properties, such as becoming less dense when solidifying, are also beneficial for life, as they allow aquatic ecosystems to survive in cold environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;liquid-water-in-the-solar-system&#34;&gt;Liquid Water in the Solar System &lt;a href=&#34;#liquid-water-in-the-solar-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of December 2015, the confirmed liquid water outside Earth in the Solar System is estimated to be 25-50 times the volume of Earth&amp;rsquo;s water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mars&#34;&gt;Mars &lt;a href=&#34;#mars&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mars ocean theory suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water. Today, water on Mars exists primarily as ice and underground, with a small amount present as vapor in the atmosphere. Liquid water may occur transiently under specific conditions. The low atmospheric pressure and temperature prevent large bodies of standing liquid water from existing. Recurring slope lineae are thought to be caused by flows of brine. In July 2018, scientists from the Italian Space Agency detected a subglacial lake 1.5 kilometers below the southern polar ice cap, providing the first evidence of a stable body of liquid water on Mars. The water is thought to remain liquid due to the presence of magnesium and calcium perchlorates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;europa&#34;&gt;Europa &lt;a href=&#34;#europa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists generally agree that a layer of liquid water exists beneath the surface of Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Heat from tidal flexing allows the subsurface ocean to remain liquid. The outer crust of solid ice is estimated to be 10-30 km thick, while the liquid ocean underneath may be about 100 km deep, resulting in a volume slightly more than twice that of Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enceladus&#34;&gt;Enceladus &lt;a href=&#34;#enceladus&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has geysers of water, confirmed by the &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; spacecraft. Gravimetric data confirmed a subsurface ocean. Evidence suggests the subsurface ocean is global in nature. The geysers also contain small amounts of salt, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and volatile hydrocarbons. The melting of the ocean water and the geysers appear to be driven by tidal flux from Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mimas&#34;&gt;Mimas &lt;a href=&#34;#mimas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimas, another moon of Saturn, was found by &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; to have a &amp;ldquo;rocking&amp;rdquo; motion whose amplitude could only be explained by a large subsurface ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ganymede&#34;&gt;Ganymede &lt;a href=&#34;#ganymede&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subsurface saline ocean is theorized to exist on Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter, following observation by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2015. Patterns in auroral belts and rocking of the magnetic field suggest the presence of an ocean. It is estimated to be 100 km deep with the surface lying below a crust of 150 km of ice. The precise quantity of liquid water on Ganymede is highly uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ceres&#34;&gt;Ceres &lt;a href=&#34;#ceres&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle, and may have a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice. The surface is probably a mixture of water ice and hydrated minerals. Emissions of water vapor have been detected from several regions of Ceres. Ceres also features a mountain called Ahuna Mons that is thought to be a cryovolcanic dome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ice-giants&#34;&gt;Ice Giants &lt;a href=&#34;#ice-giants&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune are thought to have a supercritical water ocean beneath their clouds, which accounts for about two-thirds of their total mass, most likely surrounding small rocky cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pluto&#34;&gt;Pluto &lt;a href=&#34;#pluto&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2020, astronomers reported evidence that the dwarf planet Pluto may have had a subsurface ocean, and consequently may have been habitable, when it was first formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;indicators-methods-of-detection-and-confirmation&#34;&gt;Indicators, Methods of Detection and Confirmation &lt;a href=&#34;#indicators-methods-of-detection-and-confirmation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most known extrasolar planetary systems appear to have very different compositions to the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spectroscopy&#34;&gt;Spectroscopy &lt;a href=&#34;#spectroscopy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid water has a distinct absorption spectroscopy signature compared to other states of water due to the state of its hydrogen bonds. Despite the confirmation of extraterrestrial water vapor and ice, the spectral signature of liquid water is yet to be confirmed outside of Earth. Seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes, though strongly suggestive of briny liquid water, have yet to indicate this in spectroscopic analysis. Water vapor has been confirmed in numerous objects via spectroscopy, though it does not by itself confirm the presence of liquid water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;magnetic-fields&#34;&gt;Magnetic Fields &lt;a href=&#34;#magnetic-fields&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Jovian moons Ganymede and Europa, the existence of a sub-ice ocean is inferred from the measurements of the magnetic field of Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geological-indicators&#34;&gt;Geological Indicators &lt;a href=&#34;#geological-indicators&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Gold posited that many Solar System bodies could potentially hold groundwater below the surface. Liquid water may exist in the Martian subsurface. Research suggests that in the past there was liquid water flowing on the surface, creating large areas similar to Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans. &amp;ldquo;Chaos terrain&amp;rdquo;, a common feature on Europa&amp;rsquo;s surface, is interpreted as regions where the subsurface ocean has melted through the icy crust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;volcanic-observation&#34;&gt;Volcanic Observation &lt;a href=&#34;#volcanic-observation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geysers have been found on Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, and Europa, moon of Jupiter. These contain water vapour and could be indicators of liquid water deeper down. In June 2009, researchers noticed that Enceladus wobbled in a certain way as it orbited Saturn, indicating that the moon&amp;rsquo;s icy crust didn&amp;rsquo;t extend all the way to its core — instead, it rested on a global ocean. On 3 April 2014, NASA reported that evidence for a large underground ocean of liquid water on Enceladus had been found by the &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; spacecraft. Emissions of water vapor have been detected from several regions of the dwarf planet Ceres, combined with evidence of ongoing cryovalcanic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gravitational-evidence&#34;&gt;Gravitational Evidence &lt;a href=&#34;#gravitational-evidence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists used gravitational measurements from the &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; spacecraft to confirm a water ocean under the crust of Enceladus. Such tidal models have been used as theories for water layers in other Solar System moons. Anomalies in the orbital libration of Saturn&amp;rsquo;s moon Mimas combined with models of tidal mechanics led scientists in 2022 to propose that it harbours an internal ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ground-penetrating-radio&#34;&gt;Ground Penetrating Radio &lt;a href=&#34;#ground-penetrating-radio&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have detected liquid water using radio signals. The radio detection and ranging (RADAR) instrument of the &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; probe was used to detect the existence of a layer of liquid water and ammonia beneath the surface of Saturn&amp;rsquo;s moon Titan. Ground penetrating radar and dielectric permittivity data from the MARSIS instrument on Mars Express indicates a 20-kilometer-wide stable body of briny liquid water in the Planum Australe region of planet Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;density-calculation&#34;&gt;Density Calculation &lt;a href=&#34;#density-calculation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planetary scientists can use calculations of density to determine the composition of planets and their potential to possess liquid water. Models of Saturn&amp;rsquo;s moon Titan density indicate the presence of a subsurface ocean layer. Similar density estimations are strong indicators of an subsurface ocean on Enceladus. GJ 1214 b was the second exoplanet to have an established mass and radius less than those of the giant Solar System planets. Its low density indicated that it is likely a mix of rock and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;models-of-radioactive-decay&#34;&gt;Models of Radioactive Decay &lt;a href=&#34;#models-of-radioactive-decay&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models of heat retention and heating via radioactive decay in smaller icy Solar System bodies suggest that Rhea, Titania, Oberon, Triton, Pluto, Eris, Sedna, and Orcus may have oceans underneath solid icy crusts approximately 100 km thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;internal-differentiation-models&#34;&gt;Internal Differentiation Models &lt;a href=&#34;#internal-differentiation-models&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models of Solar System objects indicate the presence of liquid water in their internal differentiation. Some models of the dwarf planet Ceres indicate the possibility of a wet interior layer. A global layer of liquid water thick enough to decouple the crust from the mantle is thought to be present on Titan, Europa and, with less certainty, Callisto, Ganymede and Triton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;habitable-zone&#34;&gt;Habitable Zone &lt;a href=&#34;#habitable-zone&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planet&amp;rsquo;s orbit in the circumstellar habitable zone is a popular method used to predict its potential for surface water at its surface. Habitable zone theory has put forward several extrasolar candidates for liquid water. The Gliese 581 planetary system contains multiple planets that may be candidates for surface water, including Gliese 581c, Gliese 581d, and Gliese 581e. Gliese 667 C has three of them are in the habitable zone including Gliese 667 Cc is estimated to have surface temperatures similar to Earth and a strong chance of liquid water. Kepler-22b one of the first 54 candidates found by the Kepler telescope and reported is 2.4 times the size of the Earth, with an estimated temperature of 22 °C. It is described as having the potential for&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) refers to the hypothetical existence of intelligent life beyond Earth. While no verifiable evidence of ETI has been found, the possibility has been debated since ancient times and gained traction with the Copernican Revolution. It remains a significant topic in science, science fiction, and popular culture. An alternative term, &amp;ldquo;Extraterrestrial Technological Instantiations,&amp;rdquo; avoids potentially ambiguous terms like &amp;ldquo;civilizations&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;species.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intelligence&#34;&gt;Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section defines intelligence in the context of ETI, linking it to human-like cognitive abilities, sapience, and the term &amp;ldquo;sophoncy&amp;rdquo; (wisdom), coined by Karen Anderson and popularized by Poul Anderson. It clarifies the distinction between intelligence/sapience and sentience/consciousness, noting that the latter terms are broader and include non-sapient life forms. The concept of &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial civilization&amp;rdquo; is introduced as a potential outcome of intelligent extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;probability&#34;&gt;Probability &lt;a href=&#34;#probability&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copernican principle, which suggests humans are not privileged observers, supports the idea that intelligent life could exist elsewhere in the vast universe. Stephen Hawking is mentioned as one of many scientists who believe the scale of the universe makes ETI probable. However, Fermi&amp;rsquo;s Paradox highlights the contradiction between this probability and the lack of observed contact. The section acknowledges the absence of confirmed extraterrestrial life. It also introduces the Kardashev scale as a method for measuring a civilization&amp;rsquo;s technological advancement based on energy use and the Drake equation as a probabilistic framework for estimating the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34;&gt;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the ongoing search for ETI, noting the lack of significant results despite decades of effort. Active SETI, which involves sending messages to potential extraterrestrial civilizations, is described, including examples like radio signals and the Pioneer plaque. Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI) is defined as the branch of SETI focused on composing and deciphering messages. The Arecibo message, created by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, is mentioned as a key CETI experiment. The U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s stance, reflecting expert consensus, is that the chances of contact are extremely small. The possibility of first contact being with extraterrestrial artificial intelligence is also raised. The Wow! signal is presented as the best candidate for an extraterrestrial radio signal, but its uniqueness makes definitive attribution impossible. The section also mentions a possible detection of artificial signals by China&amp;rsquo;s FAST telescope in 2022, followed by skepticism from Dan Werthimer, who attributed the signals to terrestrial radio interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-cultural-impact-of-extraterrestrial-contact&#34;&gt;Potential Cultural Impact of Extraterrestrial Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-cultural-impact-of-extraterrestrial-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the potential consequences of contact with ETI, emphasizing the wide range of possible outcomes depending on factors like technological advancement, benevolence, and mutual understanding. It mentions the possibility of contact with civilizations that have transcended biology and exist within advanced computers. The section draws parallels between ETI contact and historical encounters between vastly different human cultures, citing the Columbian Exchange as an example where the receiving civilization often suffers. It concludes by acknowledging the speculative nature of these predictions due to the lack of actual contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extraterrestrial hypothesis, which posits that some UFOs are vehicles from other worlds, is introduced. The concept of ETI as an explanation for UFOs is contrasted with EDI (extradimensional intelligence), a distinction made by J. Allen Hynek. The section also mentions a 2023 House hearing examining the executive branch&amp;rsquo;s handling of UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) refers to hypothetical intelligent life beyond Earth. It emphasizes that no such life has been verifiably observed. The concept&amp;rsquo;s modern form arose with the Copernican Revolution, which positioned Earth as one of many planets. The possibility of inhabited worlds beyond Earth is a major question in science, science fiction, and popular culture. An alternative term, &amp;ldquo;Extraterrestrial Technological Instantiations&amp;rdquo; (ETI), avoids potentially ambiguous terms like &amp;ldquo;civilizations&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;species.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intelligence&#34;&gt;Intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section defines intelligence in the context of extraterrestrial life, linking it to human-like cognitive abilities. It introduces &amp;ldquo;sapience&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sophoncy&amp;rdquo; as related terms. Karen and Poul Anderson are credited with coining the term sophoncy. The section clarifies that &amp;ldquo;sentience&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;consciousness&amp;rdquo; are broader terms that don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily imply intelligence or sapience. The term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial civilization&amp;rdquo; is presented as a specific case of extraterrestrial intelligence, representing the potential long-term result of intelligent extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;probability&#34;&gt;Probability &lt;a href=&#34;#probability&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. It mentions the Copernican principle, suggesting humans aren&amp;rsquo;t privileged observers. Stephen Hawking is noted as one of many scientists who believe the universe&amp;rsquo;s scale makes extraterrestrial life probable. Fermi&amp;rsquo;s Paradox is introduced, highlighting the contradiction between high probability estimates and the lack of evidence. The section reiterates the absence of observed extraterrestrial life. The Kardashev scale, a method for measuring a civilization&amp;rsquo;s technological advancement based on energy use, is mentioned. The Drake equation, a probabilistic framework for estimating the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, is also noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34;&gt;Search for extraterrestrial intelligence &lt;a href=&#34;#search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for ETI, noting the lack of significant results despite decades of effort. It defines Active SETI as the attempt to send messages to potential extraterrestrial civilizations, usually via radio signals, and mentions the Pioneer plaque as a physical example. Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI) is described as focusing on composing and deciphering messages. Frank Drake and Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s Arecibo message is cited as a well-known CETI experiment. It mentions that multiple independent organizations and individuals are engaged in CETI research. The U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s stance, reflecting expert consensus, is that the chances of contact are extremely small. The possibility of first contact being with extraterrestrial artificial intelligence is raised. The Wow! signal is mentioned as the best candidate for an extraterrestrial radio signal, but its uniqueness makes attribution difficult. The section concludes with the report of possible artificial signals detected by China&amp;rsquo;s FAST telescope in June 2022, followed by the caution from Dan Werthimer that these signals are likely radio interference from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-cultural-impact-of-extraterrestrial-contact&#34;&gt;Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact &lt;a href=&#34;#potential-cultural-impact-of-extraterrestrial-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the potential consequences of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. It notes that the impact could vary based on the extraterrestrial civilization&amp;rsquo;s technological advancement, intentions, and mutual comprehension with humanity. It mentions the possibility of contact with a civilization that has transcended biology and exists within advanced computers. The medium of contact (e.g., electromagnetic radiation, physical interaction) could also influence the results. The section draws parallels between extraterrestrial contact and historical encounters between vastly different human cultures, citing the Columbian Exchange as an example. It notes that such encounters have often led to the destruction of the less advanced civilization, raising the possibility of a similar outcome for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufology&#34;&gt;UFOlogy &lt;a href=&#34;#ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section connects extraterrestrial intelligence to UFOs. The extraterrestrial hypothesis, which posits that some UFOs are vehicles from extraterrestrial beings, is introduced. The section contrasts ETI with EDI (extradimensional intelligence) as explanations for UFOs, referencing J. Allen Hynek. It mentions a 2023 House hearing examining the executive branch&amp;rsquo;s handling of UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-culture&#34;&gt;In culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the cultural impact of theories about intelligent life, particularly in popular culture since the advent of spaceflight. It notes that New Mexico declared February 14th as Extraterrestrial Culture Day in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;crop-circle&#34;&gt;Crop Circle &lt;a href=&#34;#crop-circle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crop circle, crop formation, or corn circle is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was first coined in the early 1980s. While fringe theorists suggest obscure natural causes or alien origins, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the historical accounts of crop circles and related phenomena, dividing it into periods before the 20th century, the 20th century, and the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection covers early reports that could be considered precursors to modern crop circles. It mentions a 1678 news pamphlet, &lt;em&gt;The Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt;, which describes a crop whose stalks were cut in a circular pattern. It also references a 1686 report by naturalist Robert Plot on rings of mushrooms, proposing air flows as a cause. An 1880 letter to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by John Rand Capron describes circles of flattened crops possibly caused by &amp;ldquo;cyclonic wind action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;20th-century&#34;&gt;20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details observations and reports of crop circles and similar phenomena throughout the 20th century. It mentions a 1932 observation by archaeologist E. C. Curwen of dark rings in a field. David Wood reported making crop circles in 1940. Patrick Moore described circular areas of flattened wheat near a crater in Wiltshire in 1963, suggesting air currents as a cause. Reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada during the 1960s are noted. The 1966 Tully &amp;ldquo;saucer nest&amp;rdquo; case is described, where a farmer reported witnessing a saucer-shaped craft leaving a circular area of flattened grass. British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley claimed to have started creating crop circles in 1978, inspired by the Tully case. The 1974 film &lt;em&gt;Phase IV&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned as a possible inspiration for the pranksters. The late 1970s saw an increase in crop circle reports, which became widely known in the late 1980s. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles had been reported internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;21st-century&#34;&gt;21st century &lt;a href=&#34;#21st-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection covers the evolution of crop circles in the 21st century. It notes that crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring thousands of shapes and incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics. Jeremy Northcote&amp;rsquo;s research found that crop circles in the UK tend to appear near roads, populated areas, and cultural heritage monuments, suggesting human causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bower-and-chorley&#34;&gt;Bower and Chorley &lt;a href=&#34;#bower-and-chorley&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, who claimed to have started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978. They used simple tools like a plank of wood, rope, and a wire-fitted baseball cap. In 1991, they demonstrated their method to journalists. A &amp;ldquo;cereologist,&amp;rdquo; Pat Delgado, declared their circle authentic before it was revealed as a hoax. Bower and Chorley claimed responsibility for all circles made prior to 1987 and over 200 crop circles between 1978 and 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;art-and-business&#34;&gt;Art and business &lt;a href=&#34;#art-and-business&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the artistic and commercial aspects of crop circles. It notes that after simple circles in the 1970s, increasingly complex geometric designs have been created, sometimes to attract tourists. The UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, has been creating crop circles as art and for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set features an image of a crop circle. A crop-circle-making competition was held in Berkshire in 1992. In 2002, the Discovery Channel commissioned MIT graduate students to create crop circles. In 2009, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that crop circle activity was waning in Wiltshire as makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies. The 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony featured crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. A Star Wars Rebel Alliance emblem crop circle was created in California in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;legal-implications&#34;&gt;Legal implications &lt;a href=&#34;#legal-implications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the legal consequences related to creating crop circles. In 1992, Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos were sued for creating a crop circle in Hungary, but the judge ruled they were only responsible for the damage within the circle itself. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first person in the UK arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle and was fined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the various explanations for how crop circles are created, dividing it into human origins, natural origins, and alternative explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-origin&#34;&gt;Human origin &lt;a href=&#34;#human-origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the scientific consensus that crop circles are constructed by humans as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most common method involves using a rope and board to flatten the plants. Skeptics point out that all characteristics of crop circles are compatible with human creation. Bower and Chorley&amp;rsquo;s confession is mentioned, as well as the increasing complexity of circles after their revelation. The main criticism of non-human creation is the lack of evidence, while many are known to be human-made. Cases where researchers declared circles &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; only to be confronted with the hoaxers are noted. Carl Sagan concluded that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats. &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; published an article by Matt Ridley, who described how easy it is to create convincing crop circles. Some crop formations are paid for by companies for advertising. Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-origins&#34;&gt;Natural origins &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores natural explanations for crop circles, including weather and animal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather &lt;a href=&#34;#weather&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sub-subsection discusses the suggestion that crop circles may be the result of meteorological phenomena like tornadoes or ball lightning, but there is no evidence of this. John Rand Capron blamed circles on a storm in 1880. Terence Meaden proposed that whirlwinds caused the circles. Stephen Hawking said that crop circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air. Meaden conceded that complex designs were made by hoaxers after Bower and Chorley&amp;rsquo;s confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;animal-activity&#34;&gt;Animal activity &lt;a href=&#34;#animal-activity&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sub-subsection mentions that wallabies in Tasmania have been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies after consuming them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-explanations&#34;&gt;Alternative explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers alternative, less conventional explanations for crop circles, including paranormal theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paranormal&#34;&gt;Paranormal &lt;a href=&#34;#paranormal&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic speculations about crop circles, ranging from bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. Some speculate that crop circles are related to ley lines. Some paranormal advocates believe that ball lightning causes crop circles and that the patterns are controlled by some entity, such as Gaia, God, supernatural beings, the collective minds of humanity, or extraterrestrial beings. The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &amp;ldquo;man-made.&amp;rdquo; Sceptical groups and scientists criticize hypothetical explanations as pseudoscientific. No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes-to-crops&#34;&gt;Changes to crops &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-to-crops&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses claims by some scientists that there are differences between crops inside and outside the circles, suggesting they were not man-made. William Levengood published papers finding deformities in the grain inside the circles correlated to their position. Joe Nickell objected that correlation is not causation and criticized Levengood&amp;rsquo;s methods and assumptions. Advocates of non-human causes dismiss on-site evidence of human involvement as attempts to discredit the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;related-art&#34;&gt;Related art &lt;a href=&#34;#related-art&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions that patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow or sand. Images can be made in forests by cutting trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;folklore&#34;&gt;Folklore &lt;a href=&#34;#folklore&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the connection between modern crop circles and old folkloric tales. Crop circles are culture-dependent, appearing mostly in developed and secularized Western countries. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, which may be the origin of tales of &amp;ldquo;fairie rings.&amp;rdquo; A 17th-century English woodcut, the &lt;em&gt;Mowing-Devil&lt;/em&gt;, depicts the devil mowing a circular design in a field of oats. In the 1948 German story &lt;em&gt;Die zwölf Schwäne&lt;/em&gt;, a farmer finds a circular ring of flattened grain in his field every morning, caused by princesses disguised as swans dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ancient astronauts</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_96b21753a786/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_96b21753a786/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ancient-astronauts&#34;&gt;Ancient Astronauts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-astronauts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronauts, also known as ancient aliens, is a pseudoscientific belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times and influenced human civilization. Proponents suggest that these aliens affected the development of cultures, technologies, religions, and even human biology. A common idea is that deities in many religions were actually extraterrestrials, and their advanced technologies were seen as divine powers by early humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is rejected by academics and archaeologists, who consider it pseudoarchaeology and unscientific. Claims are often based on distorted or fabricated evidence. Some critics argue that ancient astronaut theories have racist implications, diminishing the achievements of indigenous cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable proponents in the late 20th century include Robert Charroux, Jacques Bergier, Jean Sendy, Erich von Däniken, Alexander Kazantsev, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, David Hatcher Childress, Peter Kolosimo, and Mauro Biglino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various terms are used to describe claims about ancient astronauts, including ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, and paleo- or biblical-SETI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers often claim that humans are descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence that landed on Earth in the past. They suggest that human knowledge, religion, and culture originated from these ancient alien visitors, who acted as a &amp;ldquo;mother culture.&amp;rdquo; Proponents also claim that extraterrestrials built or helped humans build structures like the Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island. Evidence is said to come from gaps in historical and archaeological records, as well as artifacts that are considered anachronistic and beyond the technical capabilities of ancient people. These &amp;ldquo;out-of-place artifacts&amp;rdquo; include artwork and legends reinterpreted to support extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is featured in fringe media, such as the History Channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The show mixes fact with fiction to promote theories of an alternate past, often incorporating white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs. Proponents portray themselves as an oppressed minority of academics challenging mainstream archaeology, despite lacking credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like past archaeological endeavors, the focus is on monumental structures, suggesting that indigenous people could not have built them without alien help. However, some indigenous voices argue that ancient alien theory supports their stories of extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme is the portrayal of aliens as light-skinned or Aryan, as claimed by Erich von Däniken. Some proponents are associated with white supremacism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream archaeologists have largely ignored these claims, while popular science explainers and skeptics have criticized them. Carl Sagan noted that cases of apparent interest have reasonable alternative explanations, misreporting, or are hoaxes and distortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34;&gt;History of Ancient Aliens Beliefs and Their Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-ancient-aliens-beliefs-and-their-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleocontact narratives appeared in early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt; (1898) and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Harold T. Wilkins proposed the idea in earnest in 1954. It gained popularity in the 1960s due to the Space Race and Erich von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s works. Critics emerged in the 1970s, discrediting Von Däniken&amp;rsquo;s claims. By the early 1980s, support dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shklovskii-and-sagan&#34;&gt;Shklovskii and Sagan &lt;a href=&#34;#shklovskii-and-sagan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan co-authored &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/em&gt; (1966) with Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky. In &lt;em&gt;Broca&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1979), Sagan expressed disapproval of writers like von Däniken who treated speculations as valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact. Sagan noted that many legends, artifacts, and out-of-place artifacts cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses could be explained with conventional hypotheses. He reiterated that extraterrestrial visits were possible but unproven and improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;erich-von-däniken&#34;&gt;Erich von Däniken &lt;a href=&#34;#erich-von-d%c3%a4niken&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erich von Däniken became a leading proponent in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his book &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods?&lt;/em&gt; (1968) and its sequels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken argued that certain artifacts required more advanced technology than was available to ancient cultures. He claimed that these artifacts were constructed by extraterrestrial visitors or humans who learned from them. Examples include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote that ancient art and iconography depict air and space vehicles, intelligent non-human creatures, ancient astronauts, and advanced technology. He also stated that geographically separated cultures share artistic themes, implying a common origin. One example is his interpretation of the sarcophagus lid from the tomb of Pacal the Great in Palenque, which he saw as a seated astronaut, while Maya texts identify it as a portrait of the ruler with the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Däniken interpreted the origins of many religions as reactions to encounters with an alien race, whose technology was seen as supernatural. He stated that religious traditions contain references to alien visitors, such as Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s revelation, which he interpreted as a landing spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. through the NBC-TV documentary &lt;em&gt;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; and the film &lt;em&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, made unfounded claims, and failed to validate his core claims. Christian creationists also criticized his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Nazca Lines, von Däniken stated that they resembled an airfield when seen from the air. Kenneth L. Feder argues that readers seeing the Nazca Lines in a book about aliens would be more likely to associate them with extraterrestrial origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, von Däniken admitted that the Nazca markings could have been laid out using a system of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zecharia-sitchin&#34;&gt;Zecharia Sitchin &lt;a href=&#34;#zecharia-sitchin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zecharia Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Earth Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; series revolves around his interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts. He hypothesized that the gods of Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet Nibiru, which the Sumerians believed to be a remote &amp;ldquo;12th planet&amp;rdquo; associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru orbits the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitchin argued that Sumerian texts tell the story of 50 Anunnaki from Nibiru who came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago to mine raw materials, especially gold. They genetically engineered laborers, creating &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/em&gt;: the &amp;ldquo;Adapa&amp;rdquo; or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended that the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the end of the last ice age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been criticized by professionals. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s translations are inconsistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan F. Alford, author of &lt;em&gt;Gods of the New Millennium&lt;/em&gt;, initially adhered to Sitchin&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses but later found fault, stating that the gods personified the falling sky and that the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;robert-temple&#34;&gt;Robert Temple &lt;a href=&#34;#robert-temple&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert K. G. Temple&amp;rsquo;s 1976 book, &lt;em&gt;The Sirius Mystery,&lt;/em&gt; argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He cites advanced astronomical knowledge, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations. His work draws on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies and suggest that the Dogon may have received their astronomical information recently from European sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-religions&#34;&gt;UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various new religious movements, including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, Raëlism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate, believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many see ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities suggesting that members associate enchantment with science fiction memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;claims-of-proponents&#34;&gt;Claims of Proponents &lt;a href=&#34;#claims-of-proponents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; cited as evidence can be explained without invoking ancient astronauts. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ancient-religious-texts&#34;&gt;Ancient Religious Texts &lt;a href=&#34;#ancient-religious-texts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents cite ancient mythologies, suggesting that creation myths of gods descending from the heavens to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors. They draw an analogy to cargo cults, where isolated cultures believed Western ships and cargo were sent from the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Sumerian myth of &lt;em&gt;Enûma Eliš&lt;/em&gt; says humankind was created to serve gods called the &amp;ldquo;Annunaki.&amp;rdquo; Proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to Earth to mine gold and created the human race as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ramayana&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ramayana&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel in flying vehicles called Vimana. The &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; mentions these flying objects, used by the Lankan king Ravana from Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples from the &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt; include descriptions of the Pushpak chariot, a&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;conspiracy-theories-alleging-connections-between-ufos-and-nazi-germany&#34;&gt;Conspiracy theories alleging connections between UFOs and Nazi Germany &lt;a href=&#34;#conspiracy-theories-alleging-connections-between-ufos-and-nazi-germany&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the conspiracy theories linking UFOs to Nazi Germany, asserting that the Nazis attempted to develop advanced aircraft and spacecraft before and during World War II. It further claims that these craft survived in secret underground bases in Antarctica, South America, or the United States, along with their creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-ufos-as-possible-nazi-technology&#34;&gt;Early UFOs as possible Nazi technology &lt;a href=&#34;#early-ufos-as-possible-nazi-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses how unusual aerial sightings during and after World War II were initially attributed to novel Nazi technology. During the Cold War, speculation arose that the Soviets might be deploying captured or reverse-engineered Nazi technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foo-fighters&#34;&gt;Foo fighters &lt;a href=&#34;#foo-fighters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis personnel witnessed unusual aerial phenomena called &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; While some reports were dismissed as misperceptions, others were taken seriously, leading scientists like Luis Alvarez to investigate. Allied intelligence suspected some foo fighters were advanced German aircraft or weapons, given Germany&amp;rsquo;s technological innovations like V-1 and V-2 missiles and the Me 262 jet fighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ghost-rockets&#34;&gt;Ghost rockets &lt;a href=&#34;#ghost-rockets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1946, rocket- or missile-shaped UFOs, known as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were sighted primarily in Sweden and nearby countries. Finnish observers made the first reports in February 1946. Investigations suggested some sightings were meteors, but others displayed characteristics inconsistent with meteors, such as maneuverability. It was initially believed that the ghost rockets originated from the former German rocket facility at Peenemünde and were Soviet tests of captured German missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flying-discs&#34;&gt;Flying discs &lt;a href=&#34;#flying-discs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting of crescent-shaped objects, speculation about German technology resurfaced. Project Sign personnel noted similarities between the Horten brothers&amp;rsquo; flying wing designs and some UFO reports. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of Project Blue Book, noted that the Germans had several radical aircraft and guided missiles under development at the end of WWII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest media assertion of German flying saucers appeared in the Italian newspaper &lt;em&gt;Il Giornale d&amp;rsquo;Italia&lt;/em&gt; in 1950. Professor Giuseppe Belluzzo claimed that flying discs were designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same month, German technician Rudolf Schriever claimed to &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt; that he designed a craft powered by rotating turbine blades while working at BMW&amp;rsquo;s Prague works until April 1945. He said his designs were stolen, and he believed Czech agents built his craft for a foreign power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1953, German engineer Georg Klein claimed that designs similar to Avro Canada&amp;rsquo;s Avrocar had been developed during the Nazi era. Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks: one developed by Richard Miethe in Breslau and another developed by Rudolf Schriever and Klaus Habermohl in Prague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeronautical engineer Roy Fedden stated in 1945 that the only craft that could approach the capabilities attributed to flying saucers were those being designed by the Germans towards the end of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nazi-ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;Nazi UFO conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&#34;#nazi-ufo-conspiracy-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the 1960s, fringe authors began circulating tales of Nazi UFOs tied to the occult or aliens. These theories reference various potential code-names or sub-classifications of Nazi UFO craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German UFO literature often aligns with documented history regarding Nazi Germany&amp;rsquo;s claim to New Swabia in Antarctica and its research into advanced propulsion technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-morning-of-the-magicians&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning of the Magicians&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-morning-of-the-magicians&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Matin des Magiciens&lt;/em&gt;, a 1960 book by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, made claims about the Vril Society of Berlin. Later writers, including Jan van Helsing, Norbert-Jürgen Ratthofer, and Vladimir Terziski, connected the Vril Society with UFOs, claiming the society contacted an alien race and developed spacecraft to reach them. They allege that the Vril Society, in partnership with the Thule Society and the Nazi Party, developed flying disc prototypes and retreated to a base in Antarctica after the Nazi defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-works-of-ernst-zündel&#34;&gt;The works of Ernst Zündel &lt;a href=&#34;#the-works-of-ernst-z%c3%bcndel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst Zündel&amp;rsquo;s Samisdat Publishers claimed that flying saucers were Nazi secret weapons launched from an underground base in Antarctica, aiming to conquer Earth and other planets. Zündel also sold seats on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the hollow earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miguel-serranos-book&#34;&gt;Miguel Serrano&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;#miguel-serranos-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Miguel Serrano published &lt;em&gt;El Cordón Dorado: Hitlerismo Esotérico&lt;/em&gt;, claiming that Adolf Hitler was an Avatar of Vishnu communing with Hyperborean gods in an underground Antarctic base in New Swabia. Serrano predicted that Hitler would lead a fleet of UFOs from the base to establish the Fourth Reich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;die-glocke&#34;&gt;Die Glocke &lt;a href=&#34;#die-glocke&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Glocke&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;The Bell&amp;rdquo;) was a purported top-secret Nazi scientific technological device or &lt;em&gt;Wunderwaffe&lt;/em&gt;. First described by Igor Witkowski in &lt;em&gt;Prawda o Wunderwaffe&lt;/em&gt; (2000) and popularized by Nick Cook, it was associated with Nazi occultism, antigravity, and free energy suppression research. Claims about Die Glocke have been criticized as fictional and a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists examples of Nazi UFOs appearing in popular culture, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert A. Heinlein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Rocket Ship Galileo&lt;/em&gt; (1947) featuring a Nazi Moon base.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The movie &lt;em&gt;Iron Sky&lt;/em&gt; (2012) featuring a Nazi base on the moon launching an assault on Earth with flying saucers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revell releasing a scale model kit of a Nazi flying saucer called &amp;ldquo;Haunebu II&amp;rdquo; (2018), which was later removed from production due to historical inaccuracies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The video game &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&lt;/em&gt; (2017) featuring &amp;ldquo;Haunebu-V&amp;rdquo; craft manufactured in Nazi-controlled Roswell, New Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Commando Comic Flight of Fancy (2017) featuring the Schriever Flugkreisel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second season finale of &lt;em&gt;30 Coins&lt;/em&gt; (2023) mentioning Haunebu UFOs as copies of Nazca UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Psychosocial UFO hypothesis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_89f0f0eb48db/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;psychosocial-hypothesis-in-ufology&#34;&gt;Psychosocial Hypothesis in Ufology &lt;a href=&#34;#psychosocial-hypothesis-in-ufology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychosocial hypothesis (PSH) in ufology posits that psychological and social factors best explain some UFO reports. It contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH). This perspective is favored by UFO researchers in the UK, including David Clarke and Hilary Evans, and in France, following Michel Monnerie&amp;rsquo;s 1977 book. PSH researchers distinguish themselves from debunkers by maintaining a serious, albeit skeptical, interest in UFOs. The hypothesis suggests that mundane explanations combined with emotional climates distort perceptions, and that claims of contact with extraterrestrials from uninhabitable planets point to psychological processes like dreams and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origin&#34;&gt;Origin &lt;a href=&#34;#origin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;psychosocial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; gained prominence in English UFO literature in 1984, with Jacques Scornaux and Peter Rogerson&amp;rsquo;s article in &lt;em&gt;Magonia&lt;/em&gt;. Scornaux&amp;rsquo;s use of the term originated from French UFO controversies sparked by Michel Monnerie&amp;rsquo;s challenge to the ETH. Rogerson&amp;rsquo;s adoption of the term marked a shift from paranormal explanations to normal psychological processes influenced by cultural myths and social conditioning. Writers for &lt;em&gt;Magonia&lt;/em&gt; had been exploring alternatives to the ETH since 1968, noting the failure of the ETH to account for high strangeness cases. Roger Sandell&amp;rsquo;s research on a 1905 Welsh UFO wave led him to believe that UFO reports were part of a larger complex of ghost stories and religious visions. Peter Rogerson advocated for a search for historical antecedents of UFO rumors and the social factors driving UFO flaps and social panics, noting a relationship between UFO waves and times of radical social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;science-fiction-aspects-of-the-ufo-mythos&#34;&gt;Science Fiction Aspects of the UFO Mythos &lt;a href=&#34;#science-fiction-aspects-of-the-ufo-mythos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertrand Méheust&amp;rsquo;s discovery of parallels between UFO experience narratives and pre-1947 science fiction literature led to a study of the science fiction aspects of UFO mythology. Méheust found numerous parallels, including wondrous effects and humanoid motives. Michel Monnerie integrated Meheust&amp;rsquo;s study into his historical critique of UFO mythology. Michel Meurger expanded Meheust&amp;rsquo;s thesis into a compendium of parallels. Jacques Vallee noted electromagnetic effects associated with UFOs in earlier fiction. Researchers have explored the cultural back-stories to various alien types, including Grays, insectoids, and reptoids. Other studies explore science fictional saucer esoterica along psychosocial and historical lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-saucer-rumor&#34;&gt;The Saucer Rumor &lt;a href=&#34;#the-saucer-rumor&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery of why flying saucers are the dominant shape in UFO reports was addressed by Martin Kottmeyer, who discovered that Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s initial sighting in 1947 was misinterpreted. Arnold&amp;rsquo;s description of the objects&amp;rsquo; motion, rather than their shape, led to the &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; label. This mistake shaped the UFO phenomenon for decades, influencing film imagery, saucer photography, UFO illustration, contactee tales, and abduction experiences. Kottmeyer&amp;rsquo;s findings, first reported in 1988, suggest a cultural origin for the flying saucer phenomenon. The principal counterargument is that flying saucers were seen before Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s story, but Kottmeyer argues that the dominance of the saucer shape after 1947 is the key issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34;&gt;Flaps of Flying Phantoms &lt;a href=&#34;#flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early researchers attempted to correlate UFO flaps with Mars&amp;rsquo; proximity, but these predictions failed. British researchers shifted focus to pre-1947 &amp;ldquo;waves,&amp;rdquo; examining social, religious, political, and scientific backgrounds. Roger Sandell&amp;rsquo;s work on a 1905 Welsh UFO outbreak revealed odd facets and high strangeness material. Nigel Watson reported on a 1909 panic involving German airships spying on Britain. Phantom airship flaps were catalogued from various locations, involving cigar-shaped craft and rumors of foreign spies. By the 1930s, phantom airships were replaced by phantom aeroplanes. Researchers have experimented with variations in these explanations, such as the 1905 Wales flap occurring during a time of social change. Researchers generally reject explanations involving mass hysteria, preferring to discuss flaps as collective delusions maintained by rumor and gossip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-modern-myth-of-jung&#34;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Modern Myth&lt;/em&gt; of Jung &lt;a href=&#34;#the-modern-myth-of-jung&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Gustav Jung&amp;rsquo;s essay &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&lt;/em&gt; is considered a foundational work for the PSH. Jung&amp;rsquo;s use of synchronicity has also led some to see him as a proponent of paranormal explanations. While Jung acknowledged the possibility of some UFOs being physical objects, he clarified that he was uncommitted on the issue of their reality. He expressed concern that news affirming the existence of UFOs was more welcome than skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psychosocial hypothesis (PSH) in ufology suggests that some UFO reports are best explained by psychological or social factors rather than extraterrestrial origins. It contrasts with the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) and is favored by UFO researchers in the UK and France. Proponents view UFOs as an interesting subject for study, even with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bertrand Méheust&amp;rsquo;s study of science fiction parallels to UFO mythology revealed numerous similarities between UFO experience narratives and pre-1947 science fiction literature. These parallels include wondrous effects like invisible force-fields, teleportation, and engine-stopping rays, as well as humanoid motives for visiting Earth. Michel Monnerie integrated Meheust&amp;rsquo;s study into his historical critique of UFO mythology. Michel Meurger expanded Meheust&amp;rsquo;s thesis with a compendium of parallels.

&lt;p&gt;The psychosocial approach helped solve the mystery of why flying saucers are the dominant shape in UFO reports. Martin Kottmeyer discovered that the &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; label originated from a misinterpretation of Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s 1947 sighting. Arnold described the objects&amp;rsquo; motion as erratic, &amp;ldquo;like a saucer if you skip it across the water,&amp;rdquo; but the reporter misinterpreted this as describing the objects&amp;rsquo; shape. This mistake shaped the UFO phenomenon for decades, influencing film imagery, saucer photography, UFO illustration, contactee tales, and abduction experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34;&gt;Flaps of Flying Phantoms &lt;a href=&#34;#flaps-of-flying-phantoms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

British researchers shifted focus to pre-1947 &amp;ldquo;waves,&amp;rdquo; examining social, religious, political, and scientific backgrounds. Nigel Watson researched a March–May 1909 panic involving German airships spying on Britain. Phantom airship flaps were cataloged in various locations, often accompanied by rumors of foreign spies. By the 1930s, phantom airships were replaced by phantom aeroplanes.

Researchers generally reject explanations involving mass hysteria, preferring to discuss flaps as collective delusions maintained by rumor and gossip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl Gustav Jung&amp;rsquo;s essay &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&lt;/em&gt; is considered a foundational work of the PSH. While some argue that Jung also considered the ETH, Jung himself refuted claims that he believed UFOs were physically real. He emphasized the psychological significance of the UFO phenomenon, regardless of its objective reality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alien invasion, also known as space invasion, is a prevalent theme in science fiction stories and films. It involves extraterrestrial lifeforms invading Earth with various motives, such as exterminating or enslaving humanity, harvesting humans for food, stealing resources, or destroying the planet. This theme is a subgenre of invasion literature, popularized by H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, and is a type of first contact science fiction. Experts consider an actual alien invasion unlikely due to the immense costs involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the origins of the alien invasion theme in fiction. H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; (1898) is considered the seminal alien invasion story, establishing themes like first contact and interplanetary war. However, earlier stories exist, such as Robert Potter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Germ Growers&lt;/em&gt; (1892), which features a covert alien invasion. The section also mentions Wells&amp;rsquo; proposed guerrilla war scenario in &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. Garrett P. Serviss&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Edison&amp;rsquo;s Conquest of Mars&lt;/em&gt;, an unauthorized sequel to &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, depicts Thomas Edison leading a counterattack on Mars. The reprinting of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; in the United States in 1927 coincided with the Golden Age of Science Fiction. John W. Campbell and other science fiction writers, including Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Clifford D. Simak, and Robert A. Heinlein, further developed the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;variations&#34;&gt;Variations &lt;a href=&#34;#variations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores different variations of the alien invasion theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-infiltration&#34;&gt;Alien Infiltration &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-infiltration&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation involves invaders taking human form and infiltrating society, even taking control of command positions. Their goal may be to take over the world or prepare for a full-scale invasion. This theme reflects Cold War fears of communist infiltration. The Reptilian conspiracy theory is mentioned as a real-world belief in covert alien infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beneficial-alien-invasion&#34;&gt;Beneficial Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#beneficial-alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation presents aliens colonizing Earth to &amp;ldquo;civilize&amp;rdquo; humanity or secretly aiding humans to prevent self-destruction. Henry Slesar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Delegate from Venus&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned. Examples include Klaatu and Gort in &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;, Gene Roddenberry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Questor Tapes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; episode &amp;ldquo;Assignment: Earth&amp;rdquo;, Arthur C. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crest of the Stars&lt;/em&gt;, the film &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;, and David Brin&amp;rsquo;s Uplift Universe series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;invasion-by-humans&#34;&gt;Invasion by Humans &lt;a href=&#34;#invasion-by-humans&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variation reverses the roles, with humans invading or attacking extraterrestrial lifeforms. Examples include the short story &lt;em&gt;Sentry&lt;/em&gt;, the video game &lt;em&gt;Phantasy Star II&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Martian Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; by Ray Bradbury, the Imperium of Man in the &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/em&gt; universe, &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Earth&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Silverberg, &lt;em&gt;Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game&lt;/em&gt; by Orson Scott Card, and the movies &lt;em&gt;Battle for Terra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Planet 51&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feasibility&#34;&gt;Feasibility &lt;a href=&#34;#feasibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the feasibility of an actual alien invasion. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute believes it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely due to resource availability and the likelihood of initial contact being through robots. David Morrison of NASA-Ames Research Center suggests first contact would be via radio communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-flying-saucer-song&#34;&gt;The Flying Saucer (song) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-flying-saucer-song&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on the 1956 novelty record &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; by Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman. It details the song&amp;rsquo;s genre, release information, structure, reception, legacy, and chart performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-information&#34;&gt;Single Information &lt;a href=&#34;#single-information&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section identifies &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; as a single by Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman, released in July 1956 on the Luniverse label. It classifies the song&amp;rsquo;s genre as mashup, novelty, break-in, and sound collage. The song&amp;rsquo;s length is 4:17 (both parts). It also provides a chronology of Buchanan and Goodman&amp;rsquo;s singles, placing &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; between their previous and subsequent releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; is a novelty record and the first in a series of break-in records by Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman. It&amp;rsquo;s considered an early example of a mashup, using segments of popular songs intertwined with spoken &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; commentary to tell a story about a UFO visit. Bill Buchanan plays the radio announcer, and Dickie Goodman plays reporter John Cameron-Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;structure&#34;&gt;Structure &lt;a href=&#34;#structure&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains the song&amp;rsquo;s construction using a reel-to-reel tape recorder. It&amp;rsquo;s described as a two-part sound collage and an audio adaptation of Orson Welles&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;The War of the Worlds,&amp;rdquo; but comedic. The song intersperses popular song lyrics into a broadcast to describe Martians landing on Earth. Buchanan&amp;rsquo;s radio disc jockey character is based on Alan Freed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song uses clips from 17 different songs, all top 20 hits from 1955 or 1956. The section lists these songs in order of appearance, divided by side one and side two of the record. Artists include Nappy Brown, The Platters, The Teenagers featuring Frankie Lymon, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, The Penguins, Smiley Lewis, Don Cherry, Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, and Bill Haley &amp;amp; His Comets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also highlights the song&amp;rsquo;s technological significance, comparing it to the work of musique concrète composers like Pierre Schaeffer, Pierre Boulez, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, who also used tape manipulation in the early 1950s. It&amp;rsquo;s also described as an early, less avant-garde example of a sample collage, compared to James Tenney&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Collage #1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-and-reception&#34;&gt;Release and Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#release-and-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extensive sampling in &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; led to copyright lawsuits against Buchanan and Goodman in July 1956. The duo faced criticism, but they responded with a follow-up song, &amp;ldquo;Buchanan and Goodman on Trial.&amp;rdquo; In November 1956, a judge ruled the song artful and clever, refusing to issue an injunction against sales. This ruling was significant because it essentially considered the record a new work, paving the way for legal sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the single and the trial record, Buchanan and Goodman created more &amp;ldquo;Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; records, forming a &amp;ldquo;UFO comedy series.&amp;rdquo; Other artists, including Dewey, George and Jack and the Belltones, Alan Freed, Steve Allen, Al &amp;ldquo;Jazzbo&amp;rdquo; Collins and the Modernaires, and Sid Noel, released their own versions of &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer.&amp;rdquo; The success of &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; increased sales of songs excerpted in the pastiche, such as The Penguins&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Earth Angel&amp;rdquo; and Little Richard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Long Tall Sally.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; is recognized as the first song to sample the work of other artists. It&amp;rsquo;s considered an early instance of sampling and industry litigation. The lawsuits against Buchanan and Goodman made them trailblazers in sampling and related litigation. The song is considered a musical concept that is now a part of popular music. It is also considered the first acknowledged example of a mashup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song paved the way for artists like Public Enemy, Freelance Hellraiser, Negativland, and Danger Mouse, who also faced litigation for sample-based copyright infringement. Steinski cited &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer&amp;rdquo; as a formative influence. The record&amp;rsquo;s influence stretches to pop music built on samplings and comedy routines that take answers out of context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;charts&#34;&gt;Charts &lt;a href=&#34;#charts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides the chart performance of &amp;ldquo;The Flying Saucer,&amp;rdquo; noting that it reached a peak position of 3 on the US Best Sellers in Stores chart in Billboard in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_d3683887b604/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 13:32:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;malmstrom-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Malmstrom UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#malmstrom-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the alleged Malmstrom UFO incident, focusing on claims that a UFO sighting was connected to a weapons failure at a nuclear missile complex in Montana in 1967. It presents claims made by retired Air Force personnel, skeptical counterarguments, and the incident&amp;rsquo;s coverage in media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1967-missile-complex-malfunction&#34;&gt;1967 Missile Complex Malfunction &lt;a href=&#34;#1967-missile-complex-malfunction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the 1967 incident at the Echo Flight missile complex, located between Hilger and Winifred, Montana, and operated by personnel from Malmstrom Air Force Base. On March 16, 1967, all sites in Echo Flight experienced a shutdown with &amp;ldquo;No-Go&amp;rdquo; indications, causing all launch facilities to lose strategic alert nearly simultaneously. An Air Force report mentioned rumors of UFOs around the area but stated they were disproven. A Mobile Strike Team reported no unusual activity or sightings. The malfunction, termed the &amp;ldquo;Echo Flight Incident,&amp;rdquo; was resolved within a day by maintenance crews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;public-claims-by-robert-salas&#34;&gt;Public Claims by Robert Salas &lt;a href=&#34;#public-claims-by-robert-salas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the claims made by Robert Salas, a 26-year-old Air Force Lieutenant at the time of the 1967 malfunction. In a 1996 Great Falls Tribune article, Salas recounted how a security guard reported flying objects performing strange maneuvers and a glowing red object hovering above the front gate. Shortly after, the complex&amp;rsquo;s ten Minuteman nuclear missiles went offline. Salas emphasized he was not a &amp;ldquo;UFO junkie&amp;rdquo; and sought answers to the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;promotion-in-media&#34;&gt;Promotion in Media &lt;a href=&#34;#promotion-in-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the media coverage of the Malmstrom UFO incident. It notes coverage in regional papers starting in 2000, including the Missoula Independent in 2001 and 2002. Air Force documents related to the incident were released under the Freedom of Information Act. Robert Salas authored &lt;em&gt;Faded Giant&lt;/em&gt; in 2005, speculating about a government cover-up to exploit extraterrestrial technology. In 2008, UFO author Robert Hastings discussed the incident in his book &lt;em&gt;UFOs and Nukes&lt;/em&gt;, which Salas defended. Salas appeared at the National Press Club in 2010 with other UFO speakers and authored &lt;em&gt;Unidentified: The UFO Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; in 2014 and &lt;em&gt;UAPs and the Nuclear Puzzle&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. The Great Falls Tribune marked the event&amp;rsquo;s 50th anniversary in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skeptical-views&#34;&gt;Skeptical Views &lt;a href=&#34;#skeptical-views&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents skeptical perspectives on the Malmstrom UFO incident. Science writer Mick West argues that the military investigated the incident and found no connection to UFO sightings, attributing the story&amp;rsquo;s persistence to Salas&amp;rsquo;s promotional efforts. Brian Dunning points out discrepancies between Salas&amp;rsquo;s memories and records from the 341st Strategic Missile Wing, suggesting the missile restart was due to a commonplace power failure and unrelated to later UFO reports. Michael Shermer, appearing with Salas on CNN, suggested that people can be unreliable observers and that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Robert Sheaffer suggests the UFO sighting was likely Mars and unrelated to the missile malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-1956-film&#34;&gt;UFO (1956 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-1956-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1956 American semi-documentary film that explores the development of the UFO phenomenon in the United States. It is noted for its use of documentary clips that have been featured in other UFO-related media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins-and-plot&#34;&gt;Origins and plot &lt;a href=&#34;#origins-and-plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1952, Hollywood producer Clarence Greene, after witnessing an unusual aerial object, contacted US Air Force public information officer Albert M. Chop. Intrigued, Greene decided to create a documentary about UFOs, using film footage provided by Chop. The film begins in 1947, covering early UFO sightings like the Kenneth Arnold sighting, the Mantell UFO incident, and the Gorman Dogfight. It follows the evolution of UFOs as a cultural fad and a concern for the US Air Force, including the history of Project Sign. The film then focuses on Albert M. Chop, who is assigned as the public information officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Chop initially debunks UFOs but gradually changes his views, believing they are unknown aircraft, possibly extraterrestrial. By 1952, Chop is in Washington, D.C., as the press spokesman for Project Blue Book. The documentary analyzes the Mariana UFO Incident of 1950 and the 1952 UFO film taken near the Great Salt Lake in Utah by Delbert Newhouse. The film concludes with the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident, where Chop played a central role, ultimately stating his belief that UFOs are a real, physical phenomenon of unknown origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast includes Willis Sperry, Nicholas Mariana, Delbert Newhouse, Wendell Swanson, and U.S. Air Force General John A. Samford as themselves. Tom Towers plays Albert M. (Al) Chop, Floyd Burton plays Major Dewey Fournet, Gene Coughlan plays an editor from the &lt;em&gt;Dayton Daily News&lt;/em&gt;, Bert Freed plays a Colonel, Stan Gordon plays a reporter, Marie Kenna plays Mrs. Albert Chop, Harry Morgan provides voices, Robert Phillips plays Captain Edward Ruppelt, William Solomon plays a German scientist, and Olan Soule is a narrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actor Harry Morgan, known for his roles in &lt;em&gt;M*A*S*H&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dragnet 1967&lt;/em&gt;, voices the pilot of &amp;ldquo;Air Force 216&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Red Dog One&amp;rdquo; during key scenes, including the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident. Morgan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dragnet 1967&lt;/em&gt; co-star Jack Webb produced and narrated the 1978 television series &lt;em&gt;Project U.F.O.&lt;/em&gt;, which recreated Project Bluebook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;mutual-ufo-network&#34;&gt;Mutual UFO Network &lt;a href=&#34;#mutual-ufo-network&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is a US-based non-profit organization dedicated to the scientific study of UFOs. Founded in 1969, it has grown to include over 4,000 members worldwide, with chapters in over 43 countries and all 50 US states. MUFON aims to investigate UFO sightings and provide information to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUFON was originally established as the Midwest UFO Network on May 31, 1969, in Quincy, Illinois, by Allen R. Utke, Walter H. Andrus, Jr., John F. Schuessler, and others. It was renamed the Mutual UFO Network in 1973 due to its expansion. In July 2020, Executive Director Jan Harzan was arrested on charges of soliciting sex from a minor and was subsequently removed from his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;operation&#34;&gt;Operation &lt;a href=&#34;#operation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, MUFON has chapters throughout the U.S. and internationally. It hosts an annual international symposium and publishes the monthly &lt;em&gt;MUFON UFO Journal&lt;/em&gt;. In 2015, MUFON founded Mutual UFO Network University, an unaccredited online institution for training UFO investigators. The organization has over 500 field investigators who investigate potential physical evidence of extraterrestrial craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUFON has faced criticism for its focus on pseudoscience, including topics like alien abduction, conspiracy theories, and human-ET hybrids. Critics argue that MUFON&amp;rsquo;s investigations lack scientific rigor and that its researchers are often not scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; reported on anti-immigrant, anti-trans, and anti-Muslim sentiments among MUFON officials and donors, including J. Z. Knight and John Ventre. This led to resignations from members like Chris Cogswell and James Clarkson. In 2020, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported that Ken Pfeifer, head of MUFON&amp;rsquo;s Rhode Island chapter, posted racist content on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is a US-based non-profit organization dedicated to the scientific study of UFOs. Founded in 1969, it has grown to include over 4,000 members worldwide, with chapters and representatives in numerous countries and all 50 US states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally established as the Midwest UFO Network in Quincy, Illinois, on May 31, 1969, by Allen R. Utke, Walter H. Andrus, Jr., and John F. Schuessler, among others. Many early members were associated with the &lt;em&gt;SKYLOOK&lt;/em&gt; newsletter and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). The organization expanded and was renamed the Mutual UFO Network in 1973. In July 2020, Executive Director Jan Harzan was arrested on charges of soliciting sex from a minor and was subsequently removed from his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;operation&#34;&gt;Operation &lt;a href=&#34;#operation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUFON is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, and has chapters in every U.S. state. It holds an annual international symposium and publishes the monthly &lt;em&gt;MUFON UFO Journal&lt;/em&gt;. In 2015, MUFON founded Mutual UFO Network University, an unaccredited online institution that trains members to investigate UFO sightings. The network claims over 500 field investigators and specialized teams to investigate potential physical evidence of extraterrestrial craft. Volunteers are trained to interview witnesses, conduct research, and analyze evidence, requiring them to pass an exam and a background check. MUFON&amp;rsquo;s website features a newsroom and case management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUFON has faced criticism for its focus on pseudoscience. Critics argue that the organization&amp;rsquo;s conferences and publications delve into topics like alien abduction, conspiracy theories, human-ET hybrids, hypnotic regression, and repressed memories, which are considered unscientific. The qualifications of the amateur volunteers who examine UFO reports have also been questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2018, &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; reported evidence of anti-immigrant, anti-trans, and anti-Muslim sentiments among MUFON officials and donors, including J. Z. Knight and former MUFON State Director for Pennsylvania John Ventre. These individuals have publicly expressed racist and/or anti-Semitic views. This led to resignations from MUFON, including former Director of Research Chris Cogswell and former board member and Washington State Director James Clarkson. Erica Lukes, former MUFON State Director for Utah, described MUFON as unwilling to adequately address sexual harassment. In 2020, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; magazine reported that Ken Pfeifer, head of MUFON&amp;rsquo;s Rhode Island chapter, posted racist memes and comments on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_0abf491c999f/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;roswell-that-ends-well&#34;&gt;Roswell That Ends Well &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-that-ends-well&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roswell That Ends Well&amp;rdquo; is the 19th episode of the third season of the animated television series &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;. It originally aired on December 9, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planet Express crew, while observing a supernova, accidentally time travel to 1947 after Fry microwaves a metal pan of popcorn. They crash-land in Roswell, New Mexico, becoming part of the Roswell Incident. Bender is shattered upon impact. The crew searches for a way back to the 31st century. Zoidberg is captured by the U.S. military and experimented on at Roswell Air Base. The military reconstructs Bender&amp;rsquo;s body into a flying saucer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew needs a microwave oven to return to their time. Professor Farnsworth warns Fry against interacting with his grandfather, Enos, to avoid a grandfather paradox. Fry tries to protect Enos, but Enos dies in a nuclear weapon test. Fry sleeps with Mildred, Enos&amp;rsquo;s fiancée, and realizes she is his grandmother, making him his own grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew storms Roswell Air Base to steal a microwave dish. Fry and Leela rescue Zoidberg from an alien autopsy. Farnsworth retrieves Bender&amp;rsquo;s body. While time jumping, Bender&amp;rsquo;s head is left behind. Back in the 31st century, the crew returns to Roswell, finds Bender&amp;rsquo;s head, and reattaches it to his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing team developed the episode from ideas initially considered for &amp;ldquo;Anthology of Interest II.&amp;rdquo; The writers initially avoided time travel in &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;, but changed their minds. They made the time travel unintentional, triggered by a supernova, to avoid regular time travel. The episode was directed by Rich Moore, who used screen position and character movement to represent time travel. Actions to the left represented the past, while actions to the right indicated progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-references&#34;&gt;Cultural references &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode references time travel stories like &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt;. It also shares similarities with the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&lt;/em&gt; episode &amp;ldquo;Little Green Men.&amp;rdquo; Bender&amp;rsquo;s head buried in the sand is similar to Data&amp;rsquo;s head in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;. Enos&amp;rsquo;s character is based on Gomer Pyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broadcast-and-reception&#34;&gt;Broadcast and reception &lt;a href=&#34;#broadcast-and-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roswell That Ends Well&amp;rdquo; won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (Programming Less Than One Hour) in 2002. Rich Moore won an Annie Award for directing. IGN ranked it as one of the best &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; episodes. David X. Cohen considered it one of his favorite episodes. &lt;em&gt;Sci Fi Weekly&lt;/em&gt; gave it an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; grade. Despite critical acclaim, the episode had low ratings during its original airing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a description of the 2009 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Trespass&lt;/em&gt;, directed by R.W. Goodwin. The film is a science-fiction comedy that pays homage to the B movies of the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is set in 1957 in California&amp;rsquo;s Mojave Desert. Astronomer Ted Lewis and his wife Lana are observing a meteor shower when something crashes nearby. Ted investigates and discovers an alien spaceship. His body is then taken over by Urp, a well-meaning alien who is searching for Ghota, a one-eyed monster that escaped from the ship. Ghota consumes people to grow and multiply, threatening Earth. Urp enlists the help of Tammy, a local waitress, to stop Ghota. The local police, Chief Dawson and Officer Vern, are skeptical. Urp and Tammy hunt down Ghota, and they eventually fall in love. At the end, Urp returns to his home planet, leaving Tammy to pursue her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film replicates the look and feel of 1950s science fiction films, with the exception of being in color. The film uses the trope of monsters terrorizing small desert towns, which was common in 1950s B movies due to lower production costs. The character of Lana Lewis is depicted as a &amp;ldquo;sexpot,&amp;rdquo; a common archetype in 1950s science fiction films. The Ghota is similar to B.O.B. from &lt;em&gt;Monsters vs. Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. The romance between Urp and Tammy is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;. Director Goodwin states that the film takes elements from &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;It Came from Outer Space&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 38% approval rating, with the consensus being that it loses its charm due to tedious dialogue and cheesy special effects. Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, stating that it was a labor of love but questioning whether there was a demand for cheesy 1950s sci-fi movies. Jeannette Catsoulis of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; described the film as a charming but pointless homage. Betsy Sharkey of the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; felt that the film stayed too true to the era and genre, forgetting to entertain. IGN praised the film&amp;rsquo;s recreation of the 1950s aesthetic but found that it couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide whether to emulate or satirize the genre. Ty Burr of &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; felt that the film was superior to &lt;em&gt;Monsters vs. Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; gave the film a &amp;ldquo;B+&amp;rdquo; rating, praising its warm tone and anti-CGI look. Gary Westfahl considers the film an overlooked gem that captures the charm of 1950s science fiction films.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;phoenix-nasa-mars-lander&#34;&gt;Phoenix (NASA Mars Lander) &lt;a href=&#34;#phoenix-nasa-mars-lander&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; was a NASA uncrewed space probe that landed on Mars on May 25, 2008, and operated until November 2, 2008. It was designed to assess the local habitability and research the history of water on Mars. The mission was part of the Mars Scout Program and cost $420 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mission-overview&#34;&gt;Mission Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission had two primary goals: to study the geological history of water on Mars and to evaluate past or potential planetary habitability in the ice-soil boundary. &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; was the first mission to return data from either of the Martian poles and contributed to NASA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Follow the water&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; strategy for Mars exploration. The primary mission was planned to last 90 sols (Martian days), but it exceeded this by two months. It was a fixed lander rather than a rover to reduce costs and allow for more scientific instruments. The mission also aimed to determine the biological potential or habitability of the Martian arctic&amp;rsquo;s soils, considering the presence of methane gas on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Mars Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; orbiter detected hydrogen, suggesting water ice below the surface, which led to the funding of the &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; mission. In August 2003, NASA selected the University of Arizona&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; mission for launch in 2007. Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory led the mission. The spacecraft used modified components from the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander and the Mars Polar Lander. Lockheed Martin kept the lander in a clean room from 2001 until the mission was funded. The mission was a partnership of universities, NASA centers, and the aerospace industry. The Canadian Space Agency provided a meteorological station. NASA approved the mission to proceed as planned on June 2, 2005, following a critical review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;specifications&#34;&gt;Specifications &lt;a href=&#34;#specifications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; had a launch mass of 670 kg, including the lander, aeroshell, parachutes, and cruise stage. The lander itself weighed 350 kg and was about 5.5 meters long with deployed solar panels. It used X-band and UHF communications. Power was generated by solar panels and a NiH2 battery. The lander systems included a RAD6000-based computer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-payload&#34;&gt;Scientific Payload &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-payload&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; carried improved versions of cameras and volatiles-analysis instruments from the Mars Polar Lander, as well as experiments from the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander. This included a robotic arm, wet chemistry laboratories, and optical and atomic force microscopes. The science payload also included a descent imager and meteorological instruments. During entry, descent, and landing (EDL), the Atmospheric Structure Experiment used accelerometer and gyroscope data to create a vertical profile of the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;robotic-arm-and-camera&#34;&gt;Robotic Arm and Camera &lt;a href=&#34;#robotic-arm-and-camera&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic arm could extend 2.35 meters and dig down to 0.5 meters below the surface to collect samples. It was designed and built for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by &lt;em&gt;Alliance Spacesystems, LLC&lt;/em&gt;. A rotating rasp-tool was used to cut into the permafrost. The Robotic Arm Camera (RAC) took full-color pictures of the area and verified the samples. The camera was made by the University of Arizona and Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;surface-stereo-imager&#34;&gt;Surface Stereo Imager &lt;a href=&#34;#surface-stereo-imager&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surface Stereo Imager (SSI) was the primary camera on the lander. It is a stereo camera that took stereo images of the Martian Arctic and measured atmospheric distortion. The camera was provided by the University of Arizona in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thermal-and-evolved-gas-analyzer&#34;&gt;Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer &lt;a href=&#34;#thermal-and-evolved-gas-analyzer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) combined a high-temperature furnace with a mass spectrometer. It baked samples of Martian dust to determine the composition of the resulting vapors. It had eight ovens to analyze separate samples. TEGA measured water vapor, carbon dioxide, water ice, minerals, and organic volatiles. TEGA was built by the University of Arizona and University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mars-descent-imager&#34;&gt;Mars Descent Imager &lt;a href=&#34;#mars-descent-imager&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) was intended to take pictures of the landing site during the last three minutes of descent. However, a potential data corruption problem was discovered, and it was decided not to use MARDI during the mission. It was built by Malin Space Science Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;microscopy-electrochemistry-and-conductivity-analyzer&#34;&gt;Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer &lt;a href=&#34;#microscopy-electrochemistry-and-conductivity-analyzer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) was an instrument package originally designed for the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander mission. It consisted of a wet chemistry lab (WCL), optical and atomic force microscopes, and a thermal and electrical conductivity probe. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory built MECA. A Swiss consortium led by the University of Neuchatel contributed the atomic force microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sample-wheel-and-translation-stage&#34;&gt;Sample Wheel and Translation Stage &lt;a href=&#34;#sample-wheel-and-translation-stage&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This instrument presents 6 of 69 sample holders to an opening in the MECA instrument to which the robotic arm delivers the samples and then brings the samples to the optical microscope and the atomic force microscope. Imperial College London provided the microscope sample substrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;optical-microscope&#34;&gt;Optical Microscope &lt;a href=&#34;#optical-microscope&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optical microscope, designed by the University of Arizona, is capable of making images of the Martian regolith with a resolution of 256 pixels/mm or 16 micrometers/pixel. The field of view of the microscope is a 2 mm × 2 mm sample holder to which the robotic arm delivers the sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;atomic-force-microscope&#34;&gt;Atomic Force Microscope &lt;a href=&#34;#atomic-force-microscope&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atomic force microscope has access to a small area of the sample delivered to the optical microscope. The instrument scans over the sample with one of 8 silicon crystal tips and measures the repulsion of the tip from the sample. The maximum resolution is 0.1 micrometers. A Swiss consortium led by the University of Neuchatel contributed the atomic force microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wet-chemistry-laboratory-wcl&#34;&gt;Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) &lt;a href=&#34;#wet-chemistry-laboratory-wcl&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wet chemistry lab (WCL) sensor assembly and leaching solution were designed and built by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Tufts University developed the reagent pellets, barium ISE, and ASV electrodes, and performed the preflight characterization of the sensor array. The robotic arm scooped up some soil and put it in one of four wet chemistry lab cells, where water was added, and, while stirring, an array of electrochemical sensors measured a dozen dissolved ions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;thermal-and-electrical-conductivity-probe-tecp&#34;&gt;Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP) &lt;a href=&#34;#thermal-and-electrical-conductivity-probe-tecp&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MECA contains a Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP). The TECP, designed by Decagon Devices, has four probes that made the following measurements: Martian soil temperature, relative humidity, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity, wind speed, and atmospheric temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meteorological-station&#34;&gt;Meteorological Station &lt;a href=&#34;#meteorological-station&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Meteorological Station (MET) recorded the daily weather of Mars during the course of the &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; mission. It is equipped with a wind indicator and pressure and temperature sensors. The MET also contains a lidar (light detection and ranging) device for sampling the number of dust particles in the air. It was designed in Canada by Optech and MDA, supported by the Canadian Space Agency. A team initially led by York University&amp;rsquo;s Professor Diane Michelangeli, then by Professor James Whiteway, oversaw the science operations of the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;launch&#34;&gt;Launch &lt;a href=&#34;#launch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; was launched on August 4, 2007, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle. The launch was nominal with no significant anomalies. The &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; lander was placed on a trajectory of such precision that its first trajectory course correction burn was only 18 m/s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jet Propulsion Laboratory made adjustments to the orbits of its two active satellites around Mars, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey, and the European Space Agency similarly adjusted the orbit of its Mars Express spacecraft to observe &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; as it entered the atmosphere and landed. &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; entered the Martian atmosphere at nearly 21,000 km/h and decreased its speed to 8 km/h before touching down. Confirmation of atmospheric entry was received at 4:46 p.m. PDT. Radio signals confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; had survived its descent and landed 15 minutes earlier. &lt;em&gt;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera photographed &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; suspended from its parachute. &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; landed in the Green Valley of Vastitas Borealis on May 25, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robotic arm&amp;rsquo;s first movement was delayed by one day when commands from Earth were not relayed to the &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; lander on Mars. The robotic arm was a critical part of the &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; Mars mission. On May 28, scientists sent commands to unstow its robotic arm and take more images of its landing site. The lander&amp;rsquo;s robotic arm touched soil on Mars for the first time on May 31, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polygonal cracking at the landing zone had previously been observed from orbit and is similar to patterns seen in permafrost areas on Earth. &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s robotic arm camera took an image underneath the lander that shows patches of a smooth bright surface uncovered when thruster exhaust blew off overlying loose soil. On June 19, 2008, NASA announced that dice-sized clumps of bright material in the &amp;ldquo;Dodo-Goldilocks&amp;rdquo; trench had vaporized over four days, implying&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aurora-texas-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Aurora, Texas, UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#aurora-texas-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the alleged UFO crash that reportedly occurred on April 17, 1897, near Aurora, Texas. Locals claimed a UFO crashed on a farm, resulting in the death of its pilot, an alien being. The pilot was purportedly buried in the Aurora Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-incident-as-reported&#34;&gt;The Incident as Reported &lt;a href=&#34;#the-incident-as-reported&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts the details of the incident as reported in the &lt;em&gt;Dallas Morning News&lt;/em&gt; article written by S.E. Haydon. The article describes how a UFO crashed into a windmill on Judge J.S. Proctor&amp;rsquo;s property. The pilot, described as &amp;ldquo;not of this world,&amp;rdquo; was speculated to be from Mars by an Army Signal Service officer named T.J. Weems. The pilot was buried with Christian rites in the Aurora Cemetery, which now has a Texas Historical Commission marker mentioning the incident. The wreckage was reportedly dumped into a well on the property. Mr. Brawley Oates, who later purchased the property, sealed the well after developing severe arthritis, which he attributed to contamination from the wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hoax-theory&#34;&gt;Hoax Theory &lt;a href=&#34;#hoax-theory&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the theory that the Aurora incident was a hoax. It cites a 1980 &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine interview with Etta Pegues, an Aurora resident, who claimed that S.E. Haydon fabricated the story to revive the town&amp;rsquo;s economy after the railroad bypassed it. Pegues also claimed that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property, a statement that was later challenged. Paranormal researcher Jerry Drake challenged the finding that the well was designed for use with a windmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigations&#34;&gt;Investigations &lt;a href=&#34;#investigations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the various investigations into the Aurora incident, including reports by KDFW, &lt;em&gt;UFO Files&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kdfw-report&#34;&gt;KDFW Report &lt;a href=&#34;#kdfw-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, KDFW aired a report featuring interviews with Jim Marrs and other locals who believed something crashed in Aurora. The report found no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-files-investigation&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Files&lt;/em&gt; Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-files-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;UFO Files&lt;/em&gt; episode, &amp;ldquo;Texas&amp;rsquo; Roswell,&amp;rdquo; featured a 1973 investigation led by Bill Case of the &lt;em&gt;Dallas Times Herald&lt;/em&gt; and MUFON. The investigation uncovered two new eyewitnesses: Mary Evans, who spoke of her parents&amp;rsquo; visit to the crash site and the discovery of the alien body, and Charlie Stephens, who saw the airship trailing smoke. MUFON investigated the Aurora Cemetery and found a grave marker that appeared to depict a flying saucer. They requested permission to exhume the site but were denied. The marker later disappeared, and metal readings from the grave vanished. The report concluded that the evidence was inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufo-hunters-investigation&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-hunters-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; episode, &amp;ldquo;First Contact,&amp;rdquo; featured Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates, allowing investigators to unseal the well on his property. Water samples showed high levels of aluminum, but the well contained no significant debris. The remains of a windmill base were found near the well site. Ground-penetrating radar revealed an unmarked grave in the cemetery near other 1890s graves. The condition of the grave was badly deteriorated, and the radar could not conclusively prove what type of remains existed. The landowner provided pieces of metal containing mostly aluminum and an unknown element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section notes the dramatization of the incident in the 1986 film &lt;em&gt;The Aurora Encounter&lt;/em&gt; and its discussion in &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. It also mentions an independent short movie titled &lt;em&gt;Aurora&lt;/em&gt; by Thomas Negovan and Aaron Shaps, which combines the incident with the Nazi conspiracy theory of Die Glocke. The Firesign Theatre&amp;rsquo;s comedy LP &lt;em&gt;Everything You Know Is Wrong&lt;/em&gt; satirizes the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kepler space telescope was part of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Discovery Program. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed construction and initial operation, while Ball Aerospace developed the flight system. Budget cuts and consolidation at NASA delayed the launch. The high-gain antenna design was changed to reduce cost and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-launch&#34;&gt;Post launch &lt;a href=&#34;#post-launch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ames Research Center managed ground system development, mission operations, and data analysis. The initial mission lifetime was 3.5 years, but noise in the data required more time. Reaction wheel failures in 2012 and 2013 threatened the mission. NASA sought alternative mission plans, leading to the K2 &amp;ldquo;Second Light&amp;rdquo; proposal. By 2015, Kepler had found over 1,000 confirmed exoplanets and thousands of candidates. Astronomers estimated billions of rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets in habitable zones. NASA announced the 1,000th confirmed exoplanet in 2015. In 2016, 1,284 new exoplanets were verified. Kepler data also helped study supernovae. The mission ended on October 30, 2018, after running out of fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacecraft-design&#34;&gt;Spacecraft design &lt;a href=&#34;#spacecraft-design&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler telescope had a mass of 1,039 kg and used a Schmidt camera with a 0.95-meter corrector plate and a 1.4-meter primary mirror. It had a 115 deg2 field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;camera&#34;&gt;Camera &lt;a href=&#34;#camera&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera&amp;rsquo;s focal plane consisted of forty-two 50 × 25 mm CCDs with a total resolution of 94.6 megapixels. The CCDs were read out every 6.5 seconds and co-added on board. Data from selected pixels was requantized, compressed, and stored in a 16 gigabyte solid-state recorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;primary-mirror&#34;&gt;Primary mirror &lt;a href=&#34;#primary-mirror&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary mirror was 1.4 meters in diameter, made by Corning using ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass. It had a nine-layer silver coating to enhance reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;photometric-performance&#34;&gt;Photometric performance &lt;a href=&#34;#photometric-performance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepler&amp;rsquo;s photometric performance was good but fell short of design goals. The objective was 20 ppm CDPP for a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. The median obtained accuracy was 29 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;orbit-and-orientation&#34;&gt;Orbit and orientation &lt;a href=&#34;#orbit-and-orientation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepler orbits the Sun in an Earth-trailing orbit with a period of 372.5 days. The photometer pointed to a field in the constellations Cygnus, Lyra, and Draco. Orientation was three-axis stabilized using fine-guidance sensors and reaction wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;operations&#34;&gt;Operations &lt;a href=&#34;#operations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) operated Kepler from Boulder, Colorado. The spacecraft&amp;rsquo;s solar array was rotated at solstices and equinoxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;communications&#34;&gt;Communications &lt;a href=&#34;#communications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA contacted Kepler using the X band communication link. Scientific data was downloaded monthly using the Ka band link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;data-management&#34;&gt;Data management &lt;a href=&#34;#data-management&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science data was processed by the Kepler Data Management Center (DMC) at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center. Calibrated data products and scientific results were archived and distributed to astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;reaction-wheel-failures&#34;&gt;Reaction wheel failures &lt;a href=&#34;#reaction-wheel-failures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction wheel failures in 2012 and 2013 were traced to pitting caused by arcing between steel ball bearings, triggered by coronal mass ejections (CMEs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;operational-timeline&#34;&gt;Operational timeline &lt;a href=&#34;#operational-timeline&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler observatory launched on March 7, 2009, aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The telescope cover was jettisoned on April 7, 2009. The focus was optimized in April 2009. Kepler began its search for planets on May 13, 2009. The first science data was sent to Earth on June 19, 2009. Safe mode events occurred in June and July 2009 due to a processor reset. A low voltage power supply was identified as the cause. In January 2010, a problem occurred with focal plane MOD-3 module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;field-of-view&#34;&gt;Field of view &lt;a href=&#34;#field-of-view&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepler had a fixed field of view (FOV) in the constellations Cygnus, Lyra, and Draco, covering 115 square degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;objectives-and-methods&#34;&gt;Objectives and methods &lt;a href=&#34;#objectives-and-methods&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepler&amp;rsquo;s objective was to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems. It aimed to determine the number of Earth-size planets in or near habitable zones, the range of orbit sizes and shapes, the number of planets in multiple-star systems, and the properties of stars with planetary systems. The transit method was used to detect planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document summarizes the Wikipedia article on the &amp;ldquo;Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,&amp;rdquo; also known as the UAP Report or the Pentagon UFO Report, published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on June 25, 2021. It covers the background, content, and aftermath of the report, which assessed information regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), including unidentified flying objects (UFOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the events leading up to the report&amp;rsquo;s release. The Senate Intelligence Committee mandated the Director of National Intelligence to collaborate with the Secretary of Defense on a report detailing government knowledge of UAPs, commonly known as UFOs. This mandate was included in Senate Report 116-233 accompanying the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The report was to include detailed analysis of data and intelligence gathered by the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), and the FBI. It also required a description of an interagency process for data collection and analysis and identification of potential national security threats. The mandate followed articles confirming the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, a Department of Defense program that began in 2007. The Department of Defense released three videos recorded by US Navy pilots, known as the Pentagon UFO videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;report&#34;&gt;Report &lt;a href=&#34;#report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the content of the nine-page preliminary assessment released on June 25, 2021. The UAPTF focused on 144 observations of &amp;ldquo;unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; by the U.S. Armed Forces, mostly from U.S. Navy personnel, from 2004 to 2021. The report found that the UAPTF was unable to identify causes of the observations found in 143 reports, with only one identified as &amp;ldquo;a large, deflating balloon&amp;rdquo;. Eighteen incidents featured &amp;ldquo;unusual flight characteristics&amp;rdquo;. Some UAP released radio frequency energy picked up by U.S. military aircraft. The report did not link the sightings to extraterrestrial life. There were 11 reports of near misses between pilots and UAPs. The report established five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, U.S. government or American industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catch-all &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the five potential explanatory categories for UAPs observed between 2004 and 2021, as identified in the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airborne Clutter:&lt;/strong&gt; Objects like birds, balloons, or debris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Atmospheric Phenomena:&lt;/strong&gt; Ice crystals, moisture, and thermal fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USG or Industry Developmental Programs:&lt;/strong&gt; Developments and classified programs by U.S. entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Adversary Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Technologies deployed by China, Russia, or other nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other:&lt;/strong&gt; Unidentified UAP due to limited data or challenges in collection, processing, or analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reactions-and-aftermath&#34;&gt;Reactions and Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#reactions-and-aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the responses to the report. The report was largely considered inconclusive. The UAPTF announced efforts to acquire additional reporting and standardize incident reporting across US military services and government agencies. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks ordered the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s top intelligence and security official to establish a more formal means of coordinating the collection, reporting, and analysis of UAP information. Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio commented on the report, emphasizing the need to understand and mitigate threats to pilots and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;response-and-analysis&#34;&gt;Response and Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#response-and-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents various perspectives on the report and the broader topic of UFOs. Adam Mann of Wired magazine traces the current interest in UFOs back to To the Stars, which made the Pentagon UFO videos available to the New York Times. Jim Semivan and Tom DeLonge of To the Stars reject the idea that Russian or Chinese technology is responsible for UAP reports. Mick West argues that advocates of alien disclosure are mischaracterizing UAPs. Ravi Kumar Kopparapu suggests that making the data informing the report publicly available would be helpful. Kathryn Dorsch sees parallels with Cold War-era interest in UFOs. Jeff Wise speculates that advanced Electronic Warfare techniques could deceive sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;UFO Legend Caused by 1947 Balloon Crash: Roswell Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident is a cornerstone of UFO lore, stemming from the recovery of debris near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Initially reported as a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; capture, the U.S. Army quickly retracted the statement, claiming it was a weather balloon. This event, coupled with subsequent government explanations and retractions, fueled decades of conspiracy theories alleging a cover-up of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1947-military-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;1947 Military Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#1947-military-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial event and its immediate aftermath. In 1947, rancher W.W. &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Brazel discovered debris on his property near Corona, New Mexico. The debris consisted of tinfoil, rubber, tape, and wooden beams. Unaware of the ongoing &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze,&amp;rdquo; Brazel initially didn&amp;rsquo;t connect the debris to UFOs. However, after visiting Corona, his uncle suggested it could be from a &amp;ldquo;flying disk.&amp;rdquo; Brazel reported the findings to Sheriff George Wilcox, who contacted Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAAF sent Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt to investigate. A press release issued by public information officer Walter Haut announced the military&amp;rsquo;s recovery of a &amp;ldquo;flying disc.&amp;rdquo; This announcement made international headlines but was quickly retracted. General Roger Ramey and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as a weather balloon at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the period between the initial incident and the rise of modern Roswell conspiracy theories. The Roswell debris retrieval faded from public attention for three decades. However, belief in government UFO cover-ups grew, fueled by hoaxes and legends of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico. The Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax introduced the idea of recovered alien bodies, which later became associated with Roswell. The concept of &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18,&amp;rdquo; a fictional location at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, emerged as a storage site for alien craft and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34;&gt;Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994) &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the resurgence of interest in Roswell and the development of modern conspiracy theories. In 1978, ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, who stated that the &amp;ldquo;weather balloon&amp;rdquo; explanation was a cover story and that he believed the debris was extraterrestrial. This interview, along with subsequent media attention, reignited interest in the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980 book &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore popularized Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account and added the claim of alien bodies found on the Plains of San Agustin. The book also connected Marcel&amp;rsquo;s account to Lydia Sleppy, a former teletype operator who claimed she was ordered to stop transmitting a story about crashed saucer wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Majestic 12 hoax, involving faked government documents, emerged in the 1980s, further fueling conspiracy theories. Glenn Dennis, a former mortician, provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses, which was endorsed by prominent Roswell ufologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing accounts of the Roswell incident led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. &lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt added testimony from new witnesses. &lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt; by Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner introduced the idea of two crashed saucers and eight aliens. &lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; by Randle and Schmitt proposed a new crash site and a different group of archaeologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-response&#34;&gt;Air Force Response &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the official government response to the growing Roswell conspiracy theories. Under pressure from New Mexico congressman Steven Schiff and the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Air Force published reports in the mid-1990s. The initial 1994 report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul, a military surveillance program. The 1995 report, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&lt;/em&gt;, supported this with documentation that narrowed the cause of the debris to a specific Mogul balloon train. The 1997 report, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;, detailed how eyewitness accounts of military personnel loading aliens into &amp;ldquo;body bags&amp;rdquo; matched the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s procedures for retrieving parachute test dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34;&gt;Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present) &lt;a href=&#34;#later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers the continued development of Roswell theories and hoaxes in recent decades. &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, a pseudo-documentary, played a major role in shaping popular opinion of Roswell. The film centered around Ray Santilli&amp;rsquo;s hoaxed footage of an alien autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, retired army intelligence officer Philip J. Corso released &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, alleging that he was shown a nonhuman body and helped oversee a project to reverse engineer recovered crash debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other theories include Annie Jacobsen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Area 51: An Uncensored History of America&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Military Base&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a claim that Nazi doctor Josef Mengele was recruited by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce &amp;ldquo;grotesque, child-size aviators.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the explanations for the Roswell incident, focusing on Project Mogul and anthropomorphic dummies. The Air Force reports identified Project Mogul as the source of the 1947 debris and concluded that other alien crash accounts were likely misidentified military programs or accidents. The 1997 Air Force report concluded that the alleged &amp;ldquo;bodies&amp;rdquo; reported by later eyewitnesses came from memories of accidents involving military casualties and memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-impact&#34;&gt;Cultural Impact &lt;a href=&#34;#cultural-impact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the impact of the Roswell incident on tourism, commercialization, and popular fiction. Roswell&amp;rsquo;s tourism industry is based on ufology museums and businesses, as well as alien-themed iconography. A yearly UFO festival has been held since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident has been depicted in numerous films and television shows, including &lt;em&gt;Hangar 18&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widespread speculation of a cover-up led to United States presidents being questioned about the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;roswell-incident&#34;&gt;Roswell Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell incident refers to the events surrounding the crash of a military balloon near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. This event later became the basis for widespread conspiracy theories alleging the recovery of an extraterrestrial spacecraft by the United States military. The article explores the initial event, the subsequent development of UFO conspiracy theories, and the official explanations provided by the United States Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;UFO Legend Caused by 1947 Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-legend-caused-by-1947-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the Roswell incident, highlighting the initial newspaper headline that reported the &amp;ldquo;capture&amp;rdquo; of a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; by the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). It sets the stage for the timeline of events, which occurred between June 4 and July 10, 1947, in Lincoln County, New Mexico. The section also mentions the &amp;ldquo;1947 flying disc craze&amp;rdquo; and lists related events such as the Kenneth Arnold sighting, the Flight 105 sighting, and various hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-balloon-debris-recovered-in-1947&#34;&gt;Military Balloon Debris Recovered in 1947 &lt;a href=&#34;#military-balloon-debris-recovered-in-1947&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the initial event, explaining that military balloon debris was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. It clarifies that this debris later became the basis for conspiracy theories about a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft. The balloon was part of the top-secret Project Mogul, operated from Alamogordo Army Air Field, designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. The United States Army initially announced the possession of a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; but retracted the statement within a day, attributing the debris to a conventional weather balloon to obscure the true purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1947-military-balloon-crash&#34;&gt;1947 Military Balloon Crash &lt;a href=&#34;#1947-military-balloon-crash&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the Roswell incident. It explains that by 1947, the United States had launched thousands of top-secret Project Mogul balloons to listen for Soviet atomic tests. On June 4, researchers at Alamogordo Army Air Field in New Mexico launched a long train of these balloons, which they lost contact with near Corona, New Mexico, where W.W. &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Brazel&amp;rsquo;s ranch was located. Brazel discovered tinfoil, rubber, tape, and thin wooden beams scattered across his ranch later that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazel, initially unaware of the &amp;ldquo;flying disc craze,&amp;rdquo; visited Corona on July 5, where his uncle suggested the debris could be from a &amp;ldquo;flying disk.&amp;rdquo; The next day, Brazel informed Sheriff George Wilcox of his discovery, who then contacted Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt were assigned to gather the material. On July 8, RAAF public information officer Walter Haut issued a press release stating that the military had recovered a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; near Roswell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section also describes the press conference where General Roger Ramey, Colonel Thomas DuBose, and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as pieces of a weather balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34;&gt;UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978) &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-conspiracy-theories-19471978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains that the 1947 debris retrieval remained relatively obscure for three decades. Reporting ceased after the government provided a mundane explanation, and broader reporting on flying saucers declined rapidly after the Twin Falls saucer hoax. Despite this, belief in UFO cover-ups by the US government became widespread. Hoaxes, legends, and stories of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico emerged that later formed elements of the Roswell myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34;&gt;Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#aztec-crashed-saucer-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax in 1948, which introduced stories of recovered alien bodies that later became associated with Roswell. The hoax narrative included small grey humanoid bodies, metal stronger than any found on Earth, indecipherable writing, and a government coverup to prevent public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hangar-18&#34;&gt;Hangar 18 &lt;a href=&#34;#hangar-18&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses &amp;ldquo;Hangar 18,&amp;rdquo; a non-existent location that many later conspiracy theories allege housed extraterrestrial craft or bodies recovered from Roswell. The idea of alien corpses from a crashed ship being stored in an Air Force morgue at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was mentioned in Scully&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Behind the Flying Saucers&lt;/em&gt;, expanded in the 1966 book &lt;em&gt;Incident at Exeter&lt;/em&gt;, and became the basis for a 1968 science-fiction novel &lt;em&gt;The Fortec Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34;&gt;Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994) &lt;a href=&#34;#roswell-conspiracy-theories-19781994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the rekindling of interest in Roswell after ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel in 1978. Marcel stated that the &amp;ldquo;weather balloon&amp;rdquo; explanation from the press conference was a cover story and that he now believed the debris was extraterrestrial. The tabloid &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; brought large-scale attention to the Marcel story the following February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-roswell-incident&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-roswell-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the first Roswell conspiracy book, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore, released in October 1980. The book argues that an extraterrestrial craft was flying over the New Mexico desert to observe nuclear weapons activity when a lightning strike killed the alien crew. It alleges that, after recovering the crashed alien technology, the US government engaged in a cover-up to prevent mass panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;majestic-12-hoax&#34;&gt;Majestic 12 Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#majestic-12-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Majestic 12, the purported organization behind faked government documents delivered anonymously to multiple ufologists in the 1980s. The anonymously delivered documents detailed the creation of a likely fictitious Majestic 12 group formed to handle Roswell debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;role-of-glenn-dennis&#34;&gt;Role of Glenn Dennis &lt;a href=&#34;#role-of-glenn-dennis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section introduces Glenn Dennis, a former mortician who provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses endorsed by prominent Roswell ufologists. Dennis claimed to have received calls from the Air Base with questions about body preservation and inquiries about small or hermetically sealed caskets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;competing-accounts-and-schism&#34;&gt;Competing Accounts and Schism &lt;a href=&#34;#competing-accounts-and-schism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains that a proliferation of competing Roswell accounts led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. The two leading UFO societies disagreed on the scenarios presented by Randle–Schmitt and Friedman–Berliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1991. The book claimed that General Arthur Exon had been aware of debris and bodies, and it included Glenn Dennis&amp;rsquo;s claims of an alien autopsy and Grady Barnett&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;alien body&amp;rdquo; accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crash-at-corona&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#crash-at-corona&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Stanton Friedman&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;Crash at Corona&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored with Don Berliner, released in 1992. The book introduced new &amp;ldquo;witnesses&amp;rdquo; and added to the narrative by doubling the number of flying saucers to two, and the number of aliens to eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-truth-about-the-ufo-crash-at-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on Randle and Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s 1994 book, &lt;em&gt;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed a cargo plane delivered alien bodies to Dwight D. Eisenhower. The book abandoned the Barnett crash site on the Plains of San Agustin and proposed a new crash site 35 miles north of Roswell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-response&#34;&gt;Air Force Response &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s official responses to Roswell conspiracy theories during the mid-1990s. The initial 1994 USAF report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul, a military surveillance program. The following year, &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&lt;/em&gt; supported this with extensive documentation that narrowed the cause of the debris to a specific Mogul balloon train launched on June 4, 1947, and lost near the Roswell debris field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34;&gt;Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present) &lt;a href=&#34;#later-theories-and-hoaxes-1994present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses later theories and hoaxes related to the Roswell incident, including the &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; film and Philip J. Corso&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-autopsy&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-autopsy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the pseudo-documentary &lt;em&gt;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed to have footage of an alien autopsy filmed after the 1947 Roswell crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-after-roswell&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#the-day-after-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses Philip J. Corso&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, released in 1997. Corso alleged that he was shown a purportedly nonhuman body suspended in liquid inside a glass coffin and that he helped oversee a project to reverse engineer recovered crash debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;related-debunked-or-fringe-theories&#34;&gt;Related Debunked or Fringe Theories &lt;a href=&#34;#related-debunked-or-fringe-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions related debunked or fringe theories, including Annie Jacobsen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Area 51: An Uncensored History of America&amp;rsquo;s Top Secret Military Base&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a claim that Nazi doctor Josef Mengele was recruited by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce &amp;ldquo;grotesque, child-size aviators&amp;rdquo; to cause hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides explanations for the Roswell incident, stating that secrecy around the 1947 debris recovery was due to Cold War military programs rather than aliens. It notes that UFO believers maintain that a spacecraft crashed near Roswell, and &amp;ldquo;Roswell&amp;rdquo; remains synonymous with UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-mogul&#34;&gt;Project Mogul &lt;a href=&#34;#project-mogul&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section identifies the crashed object from the 1947 incident as a Project Mogul device. Mogul was a military surveillance program employing high-altitude balloons to monitor nuclear tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explains that the 1947 Roswell accounts did not mention alien bodies. The 1997 Air Force report concluded that the alleged &amp;ldquo;bodies&amp;rdquo; reported by later eyewitnesses came&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section serves as an introduction to the topic, stating that the US government has been investigating UFOs since 1947 through various branches and agencies. It emphasizes that despite decades of interest, no evidence supports the extraordinary origins of UFOs, attributing sightings to natural phenomena, human technology, misapprehensions, delusions, or hoaxes. It mentions the initial Air Force projects (Sign, Grudge, Blue Book) and the Condon Report&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that further UFO study was not justified. It also highlights the 2017 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) and the Pentagon&amp;rsquo;s release of UAP videos. Finally, it notes the establishment of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), congressional hearings on UAPs, NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP study team, and the creation of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the early period of US government UFO investigations, primarily through Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;projects-sign-grudge-and-blue-book&#34;&gt;Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book &lt;a href=&#34;#projects-sign-grudge-and-blue-book&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the three main Air Force projects dedicated to investigating UFOs during the specified time frame. It mentions Steven J. Dick&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s role in officially recognizing the extraterrestrial hypothesis. The section discusses the Mantell incident and the challenges the Air Force faced in quashing extraterrestrial rumors. It describes Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s initial extraterrestrial hypothesis, which was rejected by General Hoyt S. Vandenburg. It contrasts Project Sign with Project Grudge, which adopted a more skeptical approach. The section also highlights the role of J. Allen Hynek, who advocated for continued UFO studies. It provides statistics on the number of reported sightings investigated under these projects and the percentage that remained unidentified. It also mentions the CIA&amp;rsquo;s involvement and the Robertson Panel&amp;rsquo;s concerns about the sensationalization of UFO reports. Finally, it touches on Air Force Regulation 200-2, which governed the release of information about UFOs to the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condon-report-and-congressional-hearings&#34;&gt;Condon Report and Congressional hearings &lt;a href=&#34;#condon-report-and-congressional-hearings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides a summary of government activity during this period. It notes that most military and defense authorities concluded that UFOs posed no threat to national security, but investigations were shrouded in secrecy due to classified aviation projects. It contrasts the US approach with that of other governments, which have released formerly classified UFO documents. It also mentions J. Allen Hynek and Nick Pope as exceptions to the consensus against government investment in UFO investigations. Finally, it cites Robert Sheaffer&amp;rsquo;s assessment that Project Blue Book did not yield any significant findings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Calvine UFO photograph</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_3fb0a06114df/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;calvine-ufo-photograph&#34;&gt;Calvine UFO photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#calvine-ufo-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Calvine UFO photograph, also known as the Calvine Sighting, refers to a reported UFO sighting near Calvine, Perthshire, Scotland, in August 1990. Two men reported witnessing a diamond-shaped craft while walking on the moors. They took photographs of the object as it hovered silently before ascending vertically and disappearing. The &lt;em&gt;Daily Record&lt;/em&gt; newspaper received the story and the original prints and negatives, which were then passed to the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The original materials disappeared, and the story was never published. Investigative journalist David Clarke has led efforts to locate the witnesses. The case gained public interest over the years, with partial documentation released by The National Archives in 2009. An original photograph was discovered by Clarke and published in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; in 2022, leading to significant media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-background&#34;&gt;Historical background &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Calvine sighting within the broader history of UFO photography. It mentions Nick Pope, a former Ministry of Defence desk officer, who included the Calvine sighting in his 1996 book, &lt;em&gt;Open Skies, Closed Minds&lt;/em&gt;. Pope described the sighting as intriguing and noted that the MOD&amp;rsquo;s analysis concluded the photos were likely genuine. The object was described as a solid craft, at least the size of a Harrier or Hawk fighter jet. Sean Kirkpatrick, former director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has suggested the image is a reflection and may have been doctored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-of-mod-files&#34;&gt;Release of MOD files &lt;a href=&#34;#release-of-mod-files&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details how the Calvine case gained more public attention after 2008 when the National Archives began releasing MOD UFO reports. David Clarke supervised the release and publication of these files. Among the released documents were materials related to the Calvine sighting, including a government briefing and handwritten summary. Two poor-quality photocopies of images were also included. These files revealed that DI55, a branch of the Directorate of Scientific and Technical Intelligence (DSTI), investigated the images along with a RAF photo analyst agency. Clarke later explored the Calvine incident in his book, &lt;em&gt;The UFO Files&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2015-channel-5-documentary&#34;&gt;2015 Channel 5 documentary &lt;a href=&#34;#2015-channel-5-documentary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of information from the National Archives, along with publicity from Clarke and Pope, led to increasing public interest in the case. In 2015, the incident was featured in the Channel 5 documentary series &lt;em&gt;Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;. The episode, titled &amp;ldquo;Alien Cover-Up&amp;rdquo;, included interviews with Clarke and Pope and featured a reconstruction of the sighting. A graphic artist recreated the Calvine photograph for the program, which was later mistaken by some for a genuine image. Pope has speculated on potential links to the alleged Aurora project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery-of-the-calvine-photograph&#34;&gt;Discovery of the Calvine photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#discovery-of-the-calvine-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the renewed investigation led by David Clarke in 2018 to locate the missing photographs and witnesses. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s interest was sparked by a Defence Intelligence Officer&amp;rsquo;s claim that the witnesses had photographed a classified U.S. black project platform. Clarke and his team interviewed former MOD staff and conducted public searches. In 2020, Scottish UFOlogist Straiph Wilson launched a search for the hill walkers. Clarke eventually tracked down retired RAF Press Officer Craig Lindsay, who had kept the original photograph for over 32 years. Lindsay donated the print and other items to Sheffield Hallam University&amp;rsquo;s Special Collection. Andrew Robinson, a photographic specialist, produced high-resolution digital copies and conducted an in-depth analysis, concluding that the photograph is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-search-for-kevin-russell&#34;&gt;The search for Kevin Russell &lt;a href=&#34;#the-search-for-kevin-russell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the search for a person named Kevin Russell, whose name was written on the back of the original Calvine photograph. The name was believed to be that of one of the witnesses. Despite contacting over 400 people with that name, Clarke&amp;rsquo;s team was unable to identify the witness. A person named Kevin Russell who worked at a hotel in Pitlochry was identified, but he denied any knowledge of the UFO. Nick Pope acknowledges being aware of the name Kevin Russell but declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-program-documentary-2024&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Program&lt;/em&gt; documentary (2024) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-program-documentary-2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the documentary &lt;em&gt;The Program&lt;/em&gt; by James Fox, released in December 2024, which features the Calvine UFO case. Fox interviewed David Clarke and Robinson in Sheffield and Lindsay in Scotland. The film explores the U.S. congressional effort to uncover government knowledge about UFOs and UAPs and includes an in-depth review of the Calvine case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unidentified flying object</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena, is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back to at least the 3rd century BC, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II and during the Space Age. Most UFOs are later identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, but a small percentage remain unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the late 1940s and 1950s, UFOs were commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs,&amp;rdquo; stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass the diverse range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has seen increased usage in the 21st century, partly to avoid the negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; In popular culture, &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; often implies an alien spacecraft, while the term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish this explanation from earthbound ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies indicate that most UFOs, upon thorough investigation, are identifiable as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft (military, civilian, experimental, drones), astronomical objects (bright stars, planets, meteors), balloons (weather, research, toy), hoaxes, light phenomena (mirages, flares, searchlights), other atmospheric objects (birds, unusual clouds, plasma), and psychological effects (pareidolia, hallucinations). Allan Hendry&amp;rsquo;s 1979 study found that fewer than 1% of investigated cases were hoaxes, with most sightings being misidentifications due to inexperience or misperception. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that increased investigation often reveals less mystery than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet, for example, was recorded by Chinese astronomers as early as 240 BC. Such events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes objects moving through the sky in ancient Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt; (1088), which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts from 1561 and 1566 depicting celestial phenomena over Nuremberg and Basel, respectively, which some connect to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An 1878 &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; article reporting John Martin&amp;rsquo;s sighting of a large, dark, circular object, one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous reports of &amp;ldquo;mystery airships&amp;rdquo; in United States newspapers from 1896 to 1897.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings ranged from St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire to German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects, dubbed &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected, primarily by the Swedish military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s widely reported sighting in 1947, where he described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; near Mount Rainier. This event sparked a media frenzy and numerous subsequent sightings. Weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred, involving the recovery of a downed observation balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs&amp;rdquo; emerged, and influential books by Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, and Gerald Heard promoted the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis. Media speculation intensified, particularly during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force initiated investigations into UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings between 1952 and 1969. Public pressure for declassification of UFO records mounted, but the CIA resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into American popular culture, with the Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gaining notoriety. In 1966, a Gallup poll revealed that 5% of Americans claimed to have seen a &amp;ldquo;flying saucer.&amp;rdquo; Despite efforts to debunk UFO claims, public fascination persisted, fueled by sci-fi films and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention surged following &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; report on the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos further heightened interest. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government-sponsored programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Harris Poll in 2009 indicated that 32% of Americans believed in UFOs. A 2021 Pew research poll found that 51% in the United States thought that UFOs reported by people in the military were likely to be evidence of intelligent life from beyond the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UFO reports have been investigated by governments and academics in various countries. No official government investigation has definitively confirmed that UFOs are real, physical objects of extraterrestrial origin or a threat to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known government studies include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Swedish military&amp;rsquo;s ghost rockets investigation (1946–1947).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USAF&amp;rsquo;s Project Blue Book (1947–1969).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Army/Air Force Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948–1951).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brazilian Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Operação Prato (Operation Saucer) (1977).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France&amp;rsquo;s GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN investigation (1977–present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s government investigation (1989–present).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Archives of Brazil holds documentation from the Brazilian Air Force regarding UFO investigations between 1952 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEFAA (previously CEFAA), a department of the DGAC, receives reports of UFO sightings from the public, civil aviators, and the Chilean Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of National Defence has investigated UFO reports across Canada, including the Falcon Lake incident and the Shag Harbour UFO incident. Early Canadian studies included Project Magnet (1950–1954) and Project Second Storey (1952–1954).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;united-states&#34;&gt;United States &lt;a href=&#34;#united-states&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigations into UFOs include Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, Project Twinkle, the CIA&amp;rsquo;s DS&amp;amp;T study, the Robertson Panel, the Brookings Report, the Condon Committee, the RAND Corporation study, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Sturrock panel, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953–1954) defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and mandated its investigation as a potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Committee&amp;rsquo;s negative conclusion in 1968 led to the closure of Project Blue Book in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, the White House released an official response stating that the U.S. government has no evidence of&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; were initially used to describe UFOs, stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass a broader range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged later, gaining traction in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and earthbound explanations for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs, upon investigation, are identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft, astronomical objects, balloons, hoaxes, light phenomena, other atmospheric objects and phenomena, and psychological effects. Studies have shown that misidentification of prosaic phenomena, often due to inexperience or misperception, is a primary factor in UFO sightings. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi encourages critical thinking when evaluating UFO claims, suggesting that thorough investigation often reveals less mystery than initially perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34;&gt;Early history before the 20th century &lt;a href=&#34;#early-history-before-the-20th-century&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and atmospheric optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians typically offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes objects moving through the sky in ancient Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts from the 16th century depicting celestial phenomena over Nuremberg and Basel, which some connect to ancient astronaut claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A report in the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in 1878, where a farmer described seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a saucer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

Arnold described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers,&amp;rdquo; sparking widespread public interest. Weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred, involving the recovery of debris from a downed observation balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs&amp;rdquo; emerged, and books like Donald Keyhoe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Flying Saucers Are Real&lt;/em&gt; popularized the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Media speculation intensified, particularly during the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1947, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book cataloged 12,618 sightings. The Condon Report in 1968 concluded that further UFO studies were not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became integrated into popular culture, with alien abduction accounts like the Barney and Betty Hill incident gaining prominence. Films like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, along with TV series like &lt;em&gt;In Search of&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, fueled public fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention resurfaced with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream interest. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project, aiming to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government programs like NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were established to investigate UFO claims. Congressional hearings were held in 2022 and 2023, featuring whistleblower claims from former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls indicating that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s final report stated that there was not enough data to determine the origin of some UFOs. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate concluding an extraterrestrial origin, but the Air Force Chief of Staff ordered it destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classified U.S. study by the CIA in 1952 concluded that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge, which was later reorganized as Project Blue Book. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, became critical of the program&amp;rsquo;s scientific rigor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Condon Report in 1968 arrived at a negative conclusion regarding UFOs. Project Blue Book closed down in 1970. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II. Investigations by governments, organizations, and individuals have sought to understand these phenomena, but definitive confirmation of unconventional explanations remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UFOs are unexplained aerial objects or phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term UAP is increasingly used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most UFOs are identified as known objects or phenomena after investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small percentage remains unexplained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s following the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; for the USAF to encompass a broader range of reported shapes. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged in the late 1960s and has gained usage in the 21st century. In popular culture, &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; often implies an alien spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flying saucer&amp;rdquo; was an early term for UFOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; was coined by Edward J. Ruppelt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;UAP&amp;rdquo; is a more recent term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; is often associated with alien spacecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Edward J. Ruppelt&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports of unusual aerial phenomena have existed throughout history. UFOs became a cultural phenomenon after World War II, with the Kenneth Arnold sighting in 1947 sparking widespread interest. Government investigations, such as Project Blue Book, were initiated to study UFO reports. The cultural phenomenon has inspired intellectual works, such as Carl Jung&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in UFOs, now often referred to as UAPs, with government-sponsored programs and increased media attention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34;&gt;Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) &lt;a href=&#34;#unidentified-flying-object-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified flying object (UFO), also known as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), is defined as an object or phenomenon observed in the sky that cannot be readily identified or explained. While reports of unusual aerial sightings date back centuries, the term &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; gained prominence after World War II, particularly during the Space Age. Investigations into UFO reports have been conducted by governments, organizations, and individuals, but no definitive confirmation of claims suggesting extraterrestrial origins or other unconventional explanations has emerged. Skeptics often attribute UFO sightings to misidentified natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;terminology&#34;&gt;Terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; were initially used to describe UFOs, stemming from the Kenneth Arnold incident. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt of the USAF coined the acronym &amp;ldquo;UFO&amp;rdquo; to encompass a broader range of reported shapes and performances. &amp;ldquo;Unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; (UAP) emerged later, gaining traction in the 21st century due to negative connotations associated with &amp;ldquo;UFO.&amp;rdquo; The term &amp;ldquo;extra-terrestrial vehicle&amp;rdquo; (ETV) is sometimes used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and earthbound explanations for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification&#34;&gt;Identification &lt;a href=&#34;#identification&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UFOs, upon investigation, are identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. Common sources of UFO reports include aircraft (military, civilian, experimental, drones), astronomical objects (bright stars, planets, meteors), balloons (weather, research, toy), hoaxes, light phenomena (mirages, flares, searchlights), other atmospheric objects (birds, unusual clouds, plasma), and psychological effects (pareidolia, hallucinations). Studies, such as one by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry, have found that most sightings are honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena due to inexperience or misperception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, people have observed unusual sights in the sky, including comets, meteors, planets, and optical phenomena. These events were often interpreted as supernatural portents or religious omens. While some UFO enthusiasts draw parallels between religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, art historians offer conventional religious interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of pre-contemporary reports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julius Obsequens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Liber de prodigiis&lt;/em&gt;, which describes things moving through the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shen Kuo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream Pool Essays&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts eyewitness testimony of a flying object with opening doors and blinding light in 11th-century China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woodcuts and leaflets from the 15th and 16th centuries depicting &amp;ldquo;miracles&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sky spectacles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Martin&amp;rsquo;s 1878 report of a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying at high speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20th-century-and-after&#34;&gt;20th century and after &lt;a href=&#34;#20th-century-and-after&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing round, glowing fireballs known as &amp;ldquo;foo fighters.&amp;rdquo; Explanations for these sightings ranged from St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire to German secret weapons. In 1946, over 2,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects over Scandinavia, referred to as &amp;ldquo;ghost rockets,&amp;rdquo; were collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern UFO phenomenon gained momentum with the widely reported sighting by Kenneth Arnold in 1947, who described seeing &amp;ldquo;flying saucers.&amp;rdquo; This sparked a media frenzy and numerous reports of similar sightings, including the Roswell incident. UFO enthusiasts formed &amp;ldquo;saucer clubs,&amp;rdquo; and books promoting the extraterrestrial hypothesis gained popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., media accounts and speculation led to the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. From 1947 to 1969, the U.S. Air Force investigated UFO reports through Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. The CIA also conducted a study in 1952, concluding that UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat. Public pressure for declassification of UFO records mounted, but the CIA resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official U.S. Air Force interest waned after the Condon Report in 1969, which concluded that further study of UFOs was not justified. However, some government documents suggest that non-public UFO investigations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs became part of popular culture&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the supernatural and paranormal. The Barney and Betty Hill alien abduction account gained notoriety, and UFO stories were featured in TV shows and films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, media attention resurfaced with the revelation of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. Leaked Pentagon UFO videos led to increased mainstream interest in UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the Galileo Project to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts. Government-sponsored programs, such as NASA&amp;rsquo;s UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, were established to investigate UFO claims. Congressional hearings were held to discuss military reports of UAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public belief in UFOs varies, with polls showing that a significant percentage of Americans believe UFOs are evidence of alien life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a surge in sightings in 1947, the USAAF and FBI began a formal investigation. A preliminary defense estimate concluded that &amp;ldquo;something is really flying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Force Regulation 200-2 (1953–1954) defined an Unidentified Flying Object (&amp;ldquo;UFOB&amp;rdquo;) and outlined investigation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condon Committee&amp;rsquo;s negative conclusion in 1968 led to the closure of Project Blue Book in 1970. However, some documents suggest that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, the White House released an official response stating that the U.S. government has no evidence of extraterrestrial life or government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on UAPs, finding that the UAPTF was unable to identify 143 objects spotted between 2004 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;belgian-ufo-wave&#34;&gt;Belgian UFO Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#belgian-ufo-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian UFO wave was a series of sightings of triangular UFOs in Belgium from November 29, 1989, to April 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sightings&#34;&gt;The Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#the-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the timeline and specifics of the UFO sightings during the Belgian UFO wave. It began in November 1989, with reports describing a large, flat, triangular object flying at low altitude. The peak of the wave occurred on the night of March 30, 1990. On that night, an unknown object was tracked on radar, prompting the Belgian Air Force to send two F-16s to investigate. While the pilots didn&amp;rsquo;t visually confirm the object, many people claimed to have witnessed it. The Control Reporting Center (CRC) at Glons received initial reports of unusual lights moving towards Thorembais-Gembloux. Traffic Center Control at Semmerzake tracked an object on radar, leading to the scrambling of two F-16 fighters from Beauvechain Air Base. The F-16s attempted nine interceptions, achieving radar lock briefly on three occasions, but these locks were later determined to be on each other. Members of the Wavre gendarmerie reported seeing four lights in a square formation, making jerky movements before disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;patrick-maréchal-hoax-photograph&#34;&gt;Patrick Maréchal Hoax Photograph &lt;a href=&#34;#patrick-mar%c3%a9chal-hoax-photograph&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the famous &amp;ldquo;Petit-Rechain photo,&amp;rdquo; which depicted a black triangular object with lights. The photo was widely circulated and examined by various organizations, including NASA, the French National Centre for Scientific Research, and the Belgian Royal Military Academy. For two decades, the UFOlogical organization &lt;em&gt;Société belge d&amp;rsquo;étude des phénomènes spatiaux&lt;/em&gt; (SOBEPS) claimed the photo was genuine. However, in 2011, photographer Patrick Maréchal confessed that it was a hoax. He explained that he had constructed the UFO from a polystyrene triangle with lightbulbs to prank his workmates. Brian Dunning discussed the photograph in his Skeptoid podcast, highlighting it as emblematic of the quality of evidence during the Belgian UFO wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores various explanations proposed for the Belgian UFO wave. In 1992, Marc Hallet criticized SOBEPS, arguing that the wave was a mass delusion fueled by misinformation. Pierre Magain and Marc Remy suggested that the phenomenon would be better studied by human scientists than physicists. Renaud Leclet and co. proposed that some sightings could be explained by helicopters, with the lack of noise attributed to environmental factors. Jean-Michel Abrassart argued that the beginning of the wave aligns with the psychosocial hypothesis. Auguste Meessen defended the unexplained nature of the wave, prompting rebuttals from Roger Paquay and Jean-Michel Abrassart. Brian Dunning discussed the F-16 chase, noting that radar locks were likely on each other due to atmospheric interference (Bragg scattering). He concludes that the sightings were a psychosocial phenomenon, explaining the lack of substantial evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;black-triangles&#34;&gt;Black Triangles &lt;a href=&#34;#black-triangles&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black triangles are a type of unidentified flying object (UFO) characterized by their triangular shape and dark color. These objects are typically observed at night and are often described as large, silent, hovering, moving slowly, and displaying pulsating, colored lights that can be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;british-sightings-and-uk-ministry-of-defence-report&#34;&gt;British Sightings and UK Ministry of Defence Report &lt;a href=&#34;#british-sightings-and-uk-ministry-of-defence-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the analysis of black triangle sightings by the UK Ministry of Defence in a declassified report called Project Condign. The report suggests that many unexplained UAP reports could be attributed to atmospheric gaseous electrically charged buoyant plasmas. It also mentions that some observations might be due to meteor entry into the atmosphere. The report proposes that a field with undetermined characteristics can exist between charged buoyant objects in loose formation, creating a triangular shape where light reflection doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur. A recommendation from the report advises aircraft to avoid intercepting these objects and instead position them astern to reduce collision risks. The report also speculates that plasma formations could induce vivid but incorrect perceptions in observers. Mark Stenhoff and Adrian James are mentioned as authors who doubt the scientific veracity of the Project Condign report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-sightings&#34;&gt;Other Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#other-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details various black triangle UFO sightings reported across different locations and time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1980s-hudson-valley-sightings&#34;&gt;1980s Hudson Valley Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#1980s-hudson-valley-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early 1980s, hundreds of people reported seeing UFOs over or near the Hudson River in New York state. These objects were described as hovering or slowly flying V-shaped objects with colorful lights. Some pilots claimed responsibility for these sightings, stating that the objects were ultralight aircraft flown in formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;19891992-belgian-wave&#34;&gt;1989–1992 Belgian Wave &lt;a href=&#34;#19891992-belgian-wave&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian UFO wave began in November 1989. On November 29, over thirty groups of witnesses and three police groups documented a large, flat, triangular object with lights underneath flying at low altitude without making any sound. A report titled &lt;em&gt;The Belgian UFO Wave of 1989–1992 – A Neglected Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; suggests that some sightings could be explained by helicopters, with the lack of noise attributed to engine noise in witnesses&amp;rsquo; automobiles or strong winds. The Belgian Air Force attempted to intercept an object detected by radar during this wave, but the pilots did not visually confirm the object. Brian Dunning is mentioned as a skeptic who disputes the entire Belgian UFO wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1997-phoenix-lights-incident&#34;&gt;1997 Phoenix Lights Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#1997-phoenix-lights-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the widely reported &amp;ldquo;Phoenix Lights&amp;rdquo; events, where multiple unidentified objects were observed near Phoenix, Arizona, beginning on March 13, 1997. Some objects appeared in a large &amp;ldquo;V&amp;rdquo; formation and lingered for several minutes. Residents reported that one of the black triangles was over a mile wide and drifted slowly over their houses. The US Air Force concluded that the military had been testing aircraft-launched flares during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2000-southern-illinois-incident&#34;&gt;2000 Southern Illinois Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#2000-southern-illinois-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;St. Clair Triangle&amp;rdquo; sighting occurred on January 5, 2000, over several towns in Southern Illinois. The incident was featured in television shows, and Sufjan Stevens included it in his song &amp;ldquo;Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois.&amp;rdquo; The FAA suggested that the sightings might have been due to an advertising blimp operated by the American Blimp Company. William Stage is mentioned as a source, and Eric Mack is cited for debunking his own UFO sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20042006-tinley-park-lights&#34;&gt;2004–2006 Tinley Park Lights &lt;a href=&#34;#20042006-tinley-park-lights&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple witnesses in Tinley Park and Oak Forest, Illinois, reported seeing three red lights hovering in a triangular formation on several occasions between 2004 and 2006. Some witnesses captured the lights in photographs and videos. The incident was examined in a &lt;em&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/em&gt; episode and in an episode of the television series &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt;. Julie Dekker is mentioned in connection with remembering the &amp;ldquo;Tinley Park lights.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2008-stephenville-texas&#34;&gt;2008 Stephenville, Texas &lt;a href=&#34;#2008-stephenville-texas&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mass sighting occurred in Stephenville, Texas, around January 8, 2008. The Netflix documentary series &lt;em&gt;Encounters&lt;/em&gt; claims that the black triangles seen had what looked like insects or a praying mantis inside. Angelia Joiner is mentioned as reporting on the possible UFO sighting in the &lt;em&gt;Stephenville Empire-Tribune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-aircraft&#34;&gt;Military Aircraft &lt;a href=&#34;#military-aircraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the possibility that classified military aircraft could be responsible for many black triangle UFO reports. Sightings have been reported over Antelope Valley in southern California, near military research and testing areas like Edwards Air Force Base and United States Air Force Plant 42. The National Institute for Discovery Science suggested that black triangles might be U.S. Air Force craft. The Northrop TR-3A Black Manta, a speculative surveillance aircraft, is mentioned, but its existence is not confirmed. Gregory T. Pope is cited regarding America&amp;rsquo;s new secret aircraft, and Global Security is referenced for information on the TR-3A. Geoscientist Ben McGee is identified as suggesting that border patrol drones with infrared lights could explain some black triangles. Natalie Wolchover is cited in relation to McGee&amp;rsquo;s explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;rods-optical-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Rods (Optical Phenomenon) &lt;a href=&#34;#rods-optical-phenomenon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rods, also known as skyfish, air rods, or solar entities, are elongated visual artifacts that appear in photographic images and video recordings. While cryptozoologists and ufologists consider them paranormal, most optical analyses conclude they are insects moving across the frame during capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optical-analysis&#34;&gt;Optical Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#optical-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the scientific explanations for the &amp;ldquo;rod&amp;rdquo; phenomenon. Robert Todd Carroll, consulting with entomologist Doug Yanega, identified rods as images of flying insects captured over several wing-beating cycles on video. This creates the illusion of a single, elongated body. A report by &amp;ldquo;The Straight Dope&amp;rdquo; also attributes rods to tricks of light and motion blur due to long exposure times when recording flying insects. The section emphasizes that claims of extraordinary or alien origins are often attributed to imagination or hoaxes. China Central Television (CCTV) aired a documentary debunking rods, revealing them to be ordinary insects captured by surveillance cameras. Scientists at Tonghua Zhenguo Pharmaceutical Company in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, captured &amp;ldquo;rods&amp;rdquo; in nets, finding them to be moths and other insects. UFO investigator Robert Sheaffer, after attending a lecture by Jose Escamilla, concluded that some &amp;ldquo;rods&amp;rdquo; were insects moving rapidly, while others were blurred bird wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;paranormal-claims&#34;&gt;Paranormal Claims &lt;a href=&#34;#paranormal-claims&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the paranormal interpretations of rods, particularly those promoted by Jose Escamilla. Escamilla claimed to have filmed the first rods on March 19, 1994, in Roswell, New Mexico, while attempting to film a UFO. He subsequently created videos and gave lectures promoting his claims of rods being alien life forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section contains a footnote clarifying that claims of rods being extraordinary creatures are often exploited by unscrupulous individuals for profit, according to &amp;ldquo;Straight Dope&amp;rdquo; staff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extra-terrestrial-visitors&#34;&gt;Extra Terrestrial Visitors &lt;a href=&#34;#extra-terrestrial-visitors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry details the 1983 French-Spanish science fiction film &lt;em&gt;Extra Terrestrial Visitors&lt;/em&gt; (also known as &lt;em&gt;Los nuevos extraterrestres&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pod People&lt;/em&gt;). It covers the film&amp;rsquo;s production, plot, cast, release, and reception, including its later cult status due to being featured on &lt;em&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story unfolds in the woods of New England, where egg poachers stumble upon a cave containing alien eggs. After one poacher destroys the eggs, a vengeful alien begins targeting the poachers and a rock band camping nearby. Meanwhile, a young boy named Tommy discovers the remaining egg, which hatches into a creature he names Trumpy. Tommy and Trumpy become friends, and Trumpy develops telekinetic powers. The alien mother searches for her offspring, leading to encounters with the rock band and Tommy&amp;rsquo;s family. The film culminates in a confrontation between the humans and the alien mother, with tragic consequences for some characters. Tommy and Trumpy say goodbye before Tommy returns to his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast includes Ian Serra as Rick, Nina Ferrer as Sharon, Susana Bequer as Lara Stapleton, Sara Palmer as Kathy, Óscar Martín as Tommy Stevens, Maria Albert as Tracy, Emilio Linder as Brian, Concha Cuetos as Molly Stevens, Manuel Pereiro as Bill Stevens, and Frank Braña as Burt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extra Terrestrial Visitors&lt;/em&gt; was a co-production between France and Spain, filmed in Madrid. The cast consisted largely of Spanish actors, and the film was shot in both Spanish and French, later dubbed in post-production. Juan Piquer Simón directed the film. Faruk Alatan, Dick Randall, and Edward L. Montoro produced the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was initially released in France. In the United States, it was sometimes shown on television under the title &lt;em&gt;The Unearthling&lt;/em&gt;. Film Ventures International later acquired the film and re-titled it &lt;em&gt;Pod People&lt;/em&gt; for U.S. television distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception-and-legacy&#34;&gt;Reception and legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#reception-and-legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film received negative reviews, with some finding it unintentionally funny. Its legacy is largely tied to its appearance on &lt;em&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000&lt;/em&gt; (MST3K), which lampooned the &lt;em&gt;Pod People&lt;/em&gt; version of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mystery-science-theater-3000&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#mystery-science-theater-3000&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film gained popularity after being featured on &lt;em&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000&lt;/em&gt; in 1991. The MST3K episode used a print of the film re-titled &lt;em&gt;Pod People&lt;/em&gt; by Film Ventures International. The opening and ending credits of &lt;em&gt;Pod People&lt;/em&gt; are superimposed over footage from &lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Invader&lt;/em&gt;. The fictional pop band&amp;rsquo;s song &amp;ldquo;Hear the Engines Roll&amp;rdquo; became a recurring joke on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film has been released on VHS under various titles, including &lt;em&gt;The Unearthling&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;E. T.: The Second Coming&lt;/em&gt;. The MST3K version of the film has been released on DVD and Blu-ray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nobody Told Me&amp;rdquo; is a posthumously released single by John Lennon, appearing on the album &lt;em&gt;Milk and Honey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing &lt;a href=&#34;#writing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the lyrical content and inspiration behind the song. It mentions references to J. Milton Hayes&amp;rsquo; poem &lt;em&gt;The Green Eye of the Yellow God&lt;/em&gt;, specifically the line &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu.&amp;rdquo; Lennon&amp;rsquo;s documented UFO sighting in New York on August 23, 1974, which he noted in the liner notes of his &lt;em&gt;Walls and Bridges&lt;/em&gt; album, is also referenced in the lyrics &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s UFOs over New York and I ain&amp;rsquo;t too surprised.&amp;rdquo; May Pang, Lennon&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend at the time, corroborated this event in her book &lt;em&gt;Loving John&lt;/em&gt;. The lyrics &amp;ldquo;Nobody told me there&amp;rsquo;d be days like these / Strange days indeed / Most peculiar, mama&amp;rdquo; are contrasted with the adage &amp;ldquo;My mother told me there&amp;rsquo;d be days like this.&amp;rdquo; Yoko Ono described the song as &amp;ldquo;kind of a fun song&amp;rdquo; and related it to Lennon&amp;rsquo;s feeling that the world had lost its direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details the recording history of the song.

It was released as the first single from &lt;em&gt;Milk and Honey&lt;/em&gt; in 1984. A re-release occurred in the UK in 1990 with &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Stepping Out&amp;rdquo; as the B-side. The song was originally intended for Ringo Starr&amp;rsquo;s 1981 album, &lt;em&gt;Stop and Smell the Roses&lt;/em&gt;, but Starr decided not to record it after Lennon&amp;rsquo;s death. A promo video was created in 2003 for the &lt;em&gt;Lennon Legend&lt;/em&gt; DVD, using archival footage from the early 1970s, including outtakes from the film &lt;em&gt;Imagine&lt;/em&gt;. The video features appearances by Phil Spector, George Harrison, Dick Cavett, Fred Astaire, Andy Warhol, and Miles Davis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article details a series of unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings that occurred in Washington, D.C., during July 1952. These sightings, known as the &amp;ldquo;Washington flap,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Washington National Airport Sightings,&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Invasion of Washington,&amp;rdquo; garnered significant media attention and became one of the most well-known UFO incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1952-ufo-flap&#34;&gt;1952 UFO flap &lt;a href=&#34;#1952-ufo-flap&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the broader context of the 1952 UFO flap, a period of heightened media and public interest in UFO sightings. It notes the surge in reported sightings during the summer of 1952, with the US Air Force receiving over 717 new reports, compared to 615 in the previous four years. It mentions the role of media coverage, including a &lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; magazine article titled &amp;ldquo;Have We Visitors From Space?&amp;rdquo; which is believed to have contributed to the increased sightings. The section also highlights other notable sightings and reports leading up to the Washington D.C. events, including a UFO report filed by Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles and an interception of a UFO over Boston by F-94s. The Nash-Fortenberry UFO sighting over Chesapeake Bay is also mentioned. Edward J. Ruppelt, the director of Project Blue Book, is a key figure mentioned in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings-over-washington-dc&#34;&gt;Sightings over Washington, D.C. &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings-over-washington-dc&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the specific UFO sightings that occurred over Washington, D.C., on two consecutive Saturday nights in July 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;night-of-july-19&#34;&gt;Night of July 19 &lt;a href=&#34;#night-of-july-19&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the events of the first night of sightings, beginning with air traffic controller Edward Nugent spotting seven objects on radar at Washington National Airport. Senior air-traffic controller Harry Barnes also witnessed the objects and noted their unusual movements. Controllers at the airport&amp;rsquo;s control tower, Howard Cocklin and Joe Zacko, also reported seeing unidentified blips on radar and a &amp;ldquo;bright light&amp;rdquo; in the sky. Airman William Brady at Andrews Air Force Base reported seeing an &amp;ldquo;orange ball of fire.&amp;rdquo; S.C. Pierman, a Capital Airlines pilot, observed six &amp;ldquo;white, tailless, fast-moving lights&amp;rdquo; near his plane. Staff Sgt. Charles Davenport at Andrews Air Force Base observed an orange-red light exhibiting unusual movements. Two F-94 Starfire jet fighters were dispatched from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware, but the objects vanished from radar upon their arrival, only to reappear after the jets left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;publicity-and-air-force-reaction&#34;&gt;Publicity and Air Force reaction &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-air-force-reaction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the widespread media coverage of the July 19-20 sightings, which made front-page headlines across the nation. It mentions the involvement of USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the supervisor of Project Blue Book, who was in Washington at the time but faced difficulties in investigating the sightings. The section also notes that an Air Force radar specialist, Captain Roy James, suggested that unusual weather conditions could have caused the radar targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;night-of-july-26&#34;&gt;Night of July 26 &lt;a href=&#34;#night-of-july-26&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection describes the events of the second night of sightings, beginning with a pilot and stewardess on a National Airlines flight reporting lights above their plane. Radar centers at National Airport and Andrews AFB tracked more unknown objects. USAF master sergeant Charles E. Cummings visually observed the objects at Andrews. Albert M. Chop, the press spokesman for Project Blue Book, arrived at National Airport. Two F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base were scrambled. Captain John McHugo, the flight leader, saw nothing, but his wingman, Lieutenant William Patterson, saw four white &amp;ldquo;glows&amp;rdquo; and chased them. USAF Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Book&amp;rsquo;s liaison at the Pentagon, and Lt. John Holcomb, a United States Navy radar specialist, arrived at the radar center at National Airport. Civilian aircraft also reported glowing objects that corresponded to radar blips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions a report from West Palm Beach scoutmaster Sonny DesVergers, who claimed to have been burned by a flying disc on August 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-explanation&#34;&gt;Air Force explanation &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-explanation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s official explanation for the sightings. Major Generals John Samford, USAF Director of Intelligence, and Roger M. Ramey, USAF Director of Operations, held a press conference at the Pentagon on July 29, 1952. Samford stated that the visual sightings could be explained as misidentified aerial phenomena, such as stars or meteors, and the unknown radar targets could be attributed to temperature inversion. The crew of a B-25 bomber and Air Force Captain Harold May are mentioned as witnesses who supported the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation. The CAA&amp;rsquo;s Technical Development and Evaluation Center also conducted an analysis that supported the temperature inversion theory. Donald Menzel and Philip Klass are mentioned as prominent UFO skeptics who also supported the temperature inversion/mirage hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;criticisms&#34;&gt;Criticisms &lt;a href=&#34;#criticisms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection presents criticisms of the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation. Edward J. Ruppelt, in his book, noted that radar and control tower personnel, as well as some Air Force officers, disagreed with the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation. Michael Wertheimer, a researcher for the Condon Report, stated that radar witnesses still disputed the Air Force explanation in 1966. Former radar controller Howard Cocklin maintained his belief that he saw an object over Washington National Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;white-house-concern-and-cia-interest&#34;&gt;White House concern and CIA interest &lt;a href=&#34;#white-house-concern-and-cia-interest&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the concern that the sightings caused within the White House and the CIA. President Harry Truman requested an explanation of the sightings and radar returns. CIA historian Gerald Haines noted that the Truman administration was alarmed by the sightings. The CIA formed a special study group to review the situation and recommended continued monitoring of the problem. This concern led to the creation of the Robertson Panel in January 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-robertson-panel&#34;&gt;The Robertson Panel &lt;a href=&#34;#the-robertson-panel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the creation and findings of the Robertson Panel, formed in January 1953 due to the high number of UFO reports. The panel, chaired by physicist Howard P. Robertson, consisted of prominent scientists who examined UFO cases collected by Project Blue Book. The panel dismissed most cases as not representing anything unusual or threatening and recommended that the Air Force and Project Blue Book focus on debunking UFO reports.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1976 Tehran UFO incident</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_0f836f85743b/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 02:23:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1976-tehran-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;1976 Tehran UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-tehran-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1976 Tehran UFO incident involved radar and visual sightings of an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Tehran, Iran, in the early morning hours of September 19, 1976. Two Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) F-4 Phantom II jet interceptors were dispatched to investigate. Pilots reported instrumentation and communication failures as they approached the object, which were restored upon withdrawal. One aircraft also experienced a temporary weapons systems failure while preparing to fire. An initial report was relayed to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff on the day of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 19, 1976, at least four civilians reported a shining object in the sky above Tehran. Lieutenant Yaddi Nazeri and a weapons officer were sent to investigate in an F-4 Phantom II. Nazeri reported losing all instruments and communications upon reaching Tehran, prompting a return to base where the instruments returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Parviz Jafari, a squadron commander, and First Lieutenant Jalal Damirian were dispatched in a second F-4 Phantom II. Jafari acquired radar lock on an object 27 nautical miles away, estimating its size to be comparable to a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. As he approached, Jafari described the object as flashing intense red, green, orange, and blue lights. His plane&amp;rsquo;s communications system shut off. When he attempted to fire an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, his equipment failed and only returned to normal after moving away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jafari reported a round object emerging from the primary object and moving towards him at high speed. His weapons control panel failed, and he lost all instruments and radio communication. Instructed to return to base, Jafari saw the primary, diamond-shaped object and another bright object descending towards the ground, emitting a bright light. The next day, Jafari and Damirian searched the area by helicopter but found nothing. Residents reported hearing a loud noise and seeing a bright flash of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Bridgstock of Griffith University summarized the incident as Iranian air force jets investigating lights in the sky, with at least one jet experiencing electrical failures and an attempt to fire a missile. A nearby airliner also suffered radio failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip J. Klass suggested the pilots initially mistook Jupiter for a UFO. He attributed equipment failures to pilot incompetence and equipment malfunction. Klass noted that only the first F-4 reported equipment failure and had a history of electrical outages. A McDonnell Douglas repair supervisor suggested the radar might have been in &amp;ldquo;manual track&amp;rdquo; mode, leading to misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgstock criticized UFOlogists&amp;rsquo; reports and highlighted Klass&amp;rsquo;s findings that only one aircraft had electrical malfunctions and that the aircrews were tired and could have mistaken stars or meteors for UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Dunning noted that the incident occurred during the peak of the Gamma Piscids and Southern Piscids meteorite showers, making observations of falling objects common. A beeping transponder from a C-141 aircraft was found at the supposed crash site. Dunning concluded that the Tehran 1976 UFO case was unusual only because planes chased celestial objects and experienced equipment failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-to-incident-in-the-media&#34;&gt;Reference to incident in the media &lt;a href=&#34;#reference-to-incident-in-the-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Sightings&lt;/em&gt; television program covered the incident in 1994, interviewing participants. &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; listed it among their top 10 UFO sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;Gallery &lt;a href=&#34;#gallery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gallery includes an editorial from the United States Air Force Security Services quarterly &lt;em&gt;MIJI&lt;/em&gt; newsletter, which Dunning describes as a dramatized retelling of the incident offered as an editorial on jamming and interference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Alien</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_73e88702e51c/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:56:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_73e88702e51c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-alien&#34;&gt;The Alien &lt;a href=&#34;#the-alien&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the history of &lt;em&gt;The Alien&lt;/em&gt;, an unproduced science fiction film conceived by Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray in the late 1960s. The film was a joint venture between India and the United States, with Columbia Pictures slated to produce it. Despite the involvement of notable actors like Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando, the film was ultimately shelved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story centers around an alien spaceship that lands in a rural village in Bengal, India. The villagers, awestruck by the craft, begin to worship it. The alien, named &amp;ldquo;Mr. Ang,&amp;rdquo; communicates with a young boy named Haba through dreams and engages in playful pranks within the village. The narrative also includes an Indian businessman, a journalist from Calcutta (now Kolkata), and an American engineer. A specific scene is highlighted, describing the alien&amp;rsquo;s interaction with plant life, showcasing its gentle and curious nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbia Pictures was the producer for this planned US–India co-production, and Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando were slated to play lead roles. However, Ray discovered that his script had been copyrighted by Michael Wilson, his representative in Hollywood, who claimed co-writer credit without contributing to the writing. Marlon Brando later left the project, and although James Coburn was considered as a replacement, Ray became discouraged and returned to Calcutta. Columbia Pictures expressed interest in reviving the project in the 1970s and 1980s, but it never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the similarities between &lt;em&gt;The Alien&lt;/em&gt; and Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&lt;/em&gt;, released in 1982. Satyajit Ray pointed out the parallels between his script and Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s film, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; would not have been possible without his script being available in Hollywood. Spielberg denied these claims. The article also mentions the Hindi film &lt;em&gt;Koi&amp;hellip; Mil Gaya&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Rakesh Roshan, as another film that appears to be based on &lt;em&gt;The Alien&lt;/em&gt;, particularly in its focus on an intellectually disabled person interacting with a friendly alien. In 2003, Satyajit Ray&amp;rsquo;s son, Sandip Ray, began adapting Ray&amp;rsquo;s original 1962 story &lt;em&gt;Bankubabur Bandhu&lt;/em&gt; into a Bengali television movie of the same name, which was eventually broadcast in India in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien Nation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_eed570f8ae8c/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 03:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_eed570f8ae8c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-nation&#34;&gt;Alien Nation &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-nation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A science fiction police procedural television series that aired on Fox from 1989 to 1990. It&amp;rsquo;s based on the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series is set in the near future, beginning in 1990, after a flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert. The ship contains the Tenctonese, a race of extraterrestrials escaping slavery. They are accepted as immigrants to the US, and the series explores their integration into American society. Storylines often address themes of racism and bigotry, using the Newcomers as a stand-in for discriminated minorities. The series uses social commentary to illustrate what it means to be human and the often bizarre rituals we observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Johnson, responsible for other science-fiction television series, was approached for the television adaptation of the 1988 film &lt;em&gt;Alien Nation&lt;/em&gt;. He initially had no interest in the project but was later inspired to create a series focusing on social commentary about the integration of a new minority group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;changes-from-the-film&#34;&gt;Changes from the film &lt;a href=&#34;#changes-from-the-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several changes were made from the original film. The human detective Matthew Sykes was played by James Caan in the film, but Gary Graham in the TV series. Detective George Francisco was played by Mandy Patinkin in the film, but Eric Pierpoint in the TV series. The TV series explores Newcomer culture more deeply than the film. Francisco&amp;rsquo;s family also differs, with a daughter, Emily, added to the TV series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancellation&#34;&gt;Cancellation &lt;a href=&#34;#cancellation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series ran for one season on Fox. Despite building a strong fan base, the show was cancelled due to the network&amp;rsquo;s financial difficulties. The season ended on a cliffhanger, and popular demand led to the unproduced second season premiere being adapted as a novel and comic book. Years later, Fox produced five television films to continue the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episodes&#34;&gt;Episodes &lt;a href=&#34;#episodes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series consists of 22 episodes, each dealing with the integration of the Newcomers into human society and the challenges they face. The episodes often involve police procedural elements, with Sikes and Francisco investigating crimes involving both humans and Newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;television-films&#34;&gt;Television films &lt;a href=&#34;#television-films&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five television films continued the story after the series&amp;rsquo; cancellation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Dark Horizon&lt;/em&gt; (1994)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Body and Soul&lt;/em&gt; (1995)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: Millennium&lt;/em&gt; (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Nation: The Udara Legacy&lt;/em&gt; (1997)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete series was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox in 2006. The five television films were later released as a collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revival&#34;&gt;Revival &lt;a href=&#34;#revival&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Syfy announced a new take on the series with Tim Minear writing. However, the series was later cancelled. In 2015, a remake was reported to be in the works with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm Area 51 was a Facebook event and internet meme that gained widespread attention in 2019. It centered around the idea of raiding Area 51, a highly classified United States Air Force facility, in search of extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area 51 is a United States Air Force facility within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It opened in 1955 and functioned as an aircraft testing and development facility during the Cold War. Due to its intense secrecy, Area 51 has become the subject of conspiracy theories regarding the presence of aliens. These theories began in the 1950s, with some individuals reporting UFO sightings at the base. Conspiracy theorists believe aliens, UFOs, or related information are stored at Area 51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-event-and-internet-meme&#34;&gt;Facebook event and Internet meme &lt;a href=&#34;#facebook-event-and-internet-meme&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matty Roberts, a Bakersfield resident and moderator of the Facebook page &lt;em&gt;Shitposting cause I&amp;rsquo;m in shambles&lt;/em&gt;, created the Storm Area 51 event. He devised the idea after watching Area 51 conspiracy theorist Bob Lazar and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell on &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; podcast. The event was planned to take place in Amargosa Valley on September 20, 2019. The Facebook event page included the phrase &amp;ldquo;If we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens.&amp;rdquo; The event quickly went viral, spreading to other social media platforms. The event received 2 million &amp;ldquo;going&amp;rdquo; and 1.5 million &amp;ldquo;interested&amp;rdquo; signatures. Rapper Lil Nas X released a music video for the remix of &amp;ldquo;Old Town Road&amp;rdquo; about the planned raid. Copycat events were also created, such as plans to storm a genealogical vault of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Loch Ness, the Bermuda Triangle, the US Capitol Building, and the Vatican City&amp;rsquo;s archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;response&#34;&gt;Response &lt;a href=&#34;#response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated that officials were aware of the event and issued a warning against attempting to enter the area. The FBI also stated that they would be monitoring the situation. The FAA posted temporary flight restrictions, closing the airspace above two places nearby Area 51. The DVIDS made a Twitter post depicting military personnel and a B-2 stealth bomber with a controversial caption, which was later deleted, and an apology was issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;local-government&#34;&gt;Local government &lt;a href=&#34;#local-government&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln County officials drafted an emergency declaration and a plan to pool resources with neighboring counties, anticipating a large crowd. Concerns were raised about the limited number of hotel rooms, cellphone network capacity, and overcrowding at campsites, gas stations, and medical facilities. The town of Rachel posted a caution on its website, advising attendees to be experienced in desert survival and warning that the town would likely be unable to provide sufficient resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;businesses&#34;&gt;Businesses &lt;a href=&#34;#businesses&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business owners in and around Rachel, Nevada, made preparations for visitors. Connie West, co-owner of the Little A&amp;rsquo;Le&amp;rsquo;Inn, booked all rooms and planned to open up camping space. Las Vegas businessman George Harris planned to hire bands for a festival called &amp;ldquo;The Swarm.&amp;rdquo; Other businesses around the U.S. based products and services on the event. Bud Light planned to release a promotional alien-themed beer label. Arby&amp;rsquo;s had planned to deliver food with a special menu to the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gathering-and-music-festivals&#34;&gt;Gathering and music festivals &lt;a href=&#34;#gathering-and-music-festivals&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the event was intended as comedic, some took it seriously and traveled to areas surrounding the facility. The Lincoln County Sheriff estimated that about 1,500 people showed up at the festivals, while about 150 people made the journey to the back gate of Area 51. One person attempted to enter the facility and received a warning, while six others were arrested for various offenses. Two people were injured in a rollover crash near Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two music festivals were announced: Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada, and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in Hiko, Nevada. Event creator Roberts pulled out of Alienstock 10 days before the festival, citing poor planning, and joined an alien-themed party in Las Vegas. Roberts&amp;rsquo;s lawyers sent a cease and desist regarding use of the name to Little A&amp;rsquo;Le&amp;rsquo;Inn owner Connie West, who continued with the name Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada. After the raid, the Area 51 Basecamp event was deemed a failure, while Alienstock was considered a success. The event&amp;rsquo;s aftermath saw several pending lawsuits surrounding the festival and Roberts&amp;rsquo;s call to breach the government facility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cowboys--aliens-2011-film&#34;&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens (2011 film) &lt;a href=&#34;#cowboys--aliens-2011-film&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article provides a detailed overview of the 2011 American science fiction Western film &lt;em&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Jon Favreau. It covers various aspects of the film, including its plot, cast, production, themes, marketing, release, reception, and home media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot unfolds in 1873 New Mexico Territory, where an amnesiac outlaw named Jake Lonergan, portrayed by Daniel Craig, awakens with a mysterious metal bracelet attached to his wrist. He finds himself in the town of Absolution, which is soon attacked by aliens. The aliens abduct several townspeople, including Sheriff Taggart and Percy Dolarhyde. Lonergan&amp;rsquo;s bracelet activates, transforming into a weapon that he uses to shoot down an alien ship. A posse, including Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) and a mysterious woman named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde), forms to track the aliens. Lonergan&amp;rsquo;s memories gradually return, revealing his past abduction and the death of his lover, Alice. Ella reveals herself to be an alien from another race, who came to Earth to help resist the invaders. The group plans an attack on the aliens&amp;rsquo; mothership, resulting in a final confrontation where Ella sacrifices herself to destroy the ship and save Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film features a prominent cast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Craig&lt;/strong&gt; as Jake Lonergan, an amnesiac outlaw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harrison Ford&lt;/strong&gt; as Woodrow Dolarhyde, a powerful cattleman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivia Wilde&lt;/strong&gt; as Ella Swenson, an alien traveler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Rockwell&lt;/strong&gt; as Doc, a doctor and saloon owner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Beach&lt;/strong&gt; as Nat Colorado, Dolarhyde&amp;rsquo;s Apache right-hand man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Dano&lt;/strong&gt; as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow&amp;rsquo;s son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noah Ringer&lt;/strong&gt; as Emmett Taggart, Taggart&amp;rsquo;s grandson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Carradine&lt;/strong&gt; as Sheriff John Taggart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clancy Brown&lt;/strong&gt; as Meacham, Absolution&amp;rsquo;s preacher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production section details the film&amp;rsquo;s development, casting, writing, filming, design, and visual effects. The project began in 1997, with Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures acquiring film rights to a concept by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. Jon Favreau joined as director in 2009, and Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were cast in the lead roles. Filming took place in New Mexico and California in 2010. The film was shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film to achieve a classic movie feel. Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic (ILM) created the visual effects, with Legacy Effects producing practical puppet aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes &lt;a href=&#34;#themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film explores themes of redemption, unity against a common enemy, and the clash between low-tech and high-tech cultures. Jon Favreau aimed for a plausible approach to how 19th-century humans could confront technologically superior extraterrestrial beings. The film also draws parallels between the alien invasion and the historical conflicts between European settlers and Native Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;marketing&#34;&gt;Marketing &lt;a href=&#34;#marketing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing section discusses the challenges of promoting a film with an &amp;ldquo;inherently comic&amp;rdquo; title and premise. The studio aimed to convey the film&amp;rsquo;s serious tone and adventure elements through trailers and presentations at events like San Diego Comic-Con.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens&lt;/em&gt; premiered at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2011 and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on July 29, 2011. Paramount Pictures released the film in IMAX theaters internationally, and Reliance Entertainment released it in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reception section covers the film&amp;rsquo;s box office performance and critical response. &lt;em&gt;Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens&lt;/em&gt; underperformed at the box office, earning $174.8 million worldwide on a $163 million budget. Critics praised the acting and special effects but criticized the screenplay and tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-media&#34;&gt;Home Media &lt;a href=&#34;#home-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 6, 2011, including an extended version, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and commentary with Jon Favreau. In 2024, Kino Lorber released a 4K Blu-ray of the theatrical cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infringement-lawsuit&#34;&gt;Infringement Lawsuit &lt;a href=&#34;#infringement-lawsuit&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven John Busti filed a lawsuit against Universal, DreamWorks, Platinum Studios, and Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, claiming copyright infringement. Busti claimed he wrote a preview for his story &lt;em&gt;Cowboys and Aliens&lt;/em&gt; in 1994, which was published in the April 1995 issue of &lt;em&gt;Bizarre Fantasy #1&lt;/em&gt;. The lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-legend&#34;&gt;Historical Legend &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-legend&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capsized steamboat that appears in the film is presumed to be the &lt;em&gt;Iron Mountain&lt;/em&gt; which, according to legend, steamed out of Vicksburg towing two barges. Two hours later, another boat found the barges adrift. The ship was not found until later, having apparently been refloated by flood waters and carried through a break in a levee, and grounded in a cotton field at Omega Landing, near Tallulah, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Big Sur UFO</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_76b62dd0f587/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:41:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_76b62dd0f587/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-big-sur-ufo&#34;&gt;The Big Sur UFO &lt;a href=&#34;#the-big-sur-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details a reported UFO incident that allegedly occurred during a 1964 Air Force mission near Big Sur, California. The Air Force team was stationed on a mountaintop to film Atlas missile tests from Vandenberg Air Force Base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-deployment-to-anderson-peak&#34;&gt;Air Force deployment to Anderson Peak &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-deployment-to-anderson-peak&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From August to November 1964, the U.S. Air Force deployed personnel to the Los Padres National Forest in California. They used a special telescope borrowed from Boston University to photograph missile launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Lt. Robert Jacobs was the commander for the Big Sur location, managed by the 1369th Photo Squadron. The team successfully filmed nine launches, including one of an Atlas missile called &amp;ldquo;Buzzing Bee,&amp;rdquo; capturing footage of a re-entry vehicle deploying decoy warheads. This technology was highly classified and designed to protect American nuclear weapons from Soviet interception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fringe-claims-of-extra-terrestrials&#34;&gt;Fringe claims of extra-terrestrials &lt;a href=&#34;#fringe-claims-of-extra-terrestrials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1982, Robert Jacobs wrote about the incident in the tabloid &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, claiming he had been part of a cover-up and was now breaking his silence. He described film footage of an unidentified object next to a warhead and a senior official&amp;rsquo;s reaction. Jacobs claimed he was instructed to never discuss the film. Major Florenz Mansmann reportedly confirmed Jacobs&amp;rsquo; account in a 1987 letter. Robert Hastings, a UFO author, further popularized the story in 2007. In 2021, Jacobs participated in a press conference to discuss his interpretation of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;decoy-warheads-explanation&#34;&gt;Decoy warheads explanation &lt;a href=&#34;#decoy-warheads-explanation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingston A. George, the project engineer during the incident, disputed Jacob&amp;rsquo;s claims of extraterrestrial interference in the &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;. George stated that he, too, had seen footage he wasn&amp;rsquo;t cleared to see and was instructed not to speak of it. However, George claims he knew the true purpose of the test: filming the deployment of decoy warheads and chaff to confuse enemy air defenses. He attributed the lights Jacobs reported to the explosive deployment of decoys and chaff, not a UFO energy beam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-contact-anthropology&#34;&gt;First Contact (Anthropology) &lt;a href=&#34;#first-contact-anthropology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First contact, in anthropology, refers to the initial meeting between two communities that were previously unaware of each other. This phenomenon is often associated with significant cultural and societal impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consequences&#34;&gt;Consequences &lt;a href=&#34;#consequences&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cultures with vastly different technological advancements meet, the more technologically advanced society often has a disruptive advantage. This can lead to dire consequences for the less advanced society. Disease transmission also plays a critical role, as isolated populations often lack immunity to illnesses carried by the more urbanized society. The relative sizes of the populations involved can also influence intercultural development. Outcomes of first contact can range from social integration and colonization to elimination (genocide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before contemporary instances of contact with uncontacted peoples, many communities and states were isolated from each other, possessing limited knowledge of one another. The limited formal contact between Europe and China via the Silk Road and later with the Mongol Empire is one such example. European powers, such as Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, sought to reach Greater India, leading to the mistaken identification of the Americas as the West Indies and the indigenous peoples of the Americas as &amp;ldquo;Indians.&amp;rdquo; This &amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; has been criticized as one-sided and has parallels in contemporary narratives of first contact beyond Earth, such as the Pioneer plaque. Colonialism often used first contact as a means to control knowledge and representation of &amp;ldquo;the other,&amp;rdquo; objectifying contact and its place on the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-examples&#34;&gt;Notable Examples &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-examples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous instances of first contact have occurred throughout history, including Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s invasions from Persia to India in 330 BC and the establishment of Romano-Chinese relations in the 2nd century AD. However, well-established trade routes meant that many cultures were aware of each other before they met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specific examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~1000:&lt;/strong&gt; Vikings, led by Leif Erikson, established a settlement at L&amp;rsquo;Anse Aux Meadows (present-day Canada) and encountered the Beothuk people (referred to as Skræling). The nature of this contact (peaceful or violent) is debated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 October 1492:&lt;/strong&gt; Christopher Columbus&amp;rsquo;s first voyage led to contact between the Spanish Empire and the Taíno, Galibi, and Ciboney peoples in the West Indies. This contact was violent and resulted in numerous deaths, enslavement, and subjugation of the indigenous inhabitants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 June 1579:&lt;/strong&gt; Francis Drake&amp;rsquo;s circumnavigation brought the English into contact with the Coast Miwok in Northern California. Relations remained peaceful during Drake&amp;rsquo;s month-long stay, during which he claimed the land for England as Nova Albion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 July 1595:&lt;/strong&gt; Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira led a Spanish expedition to the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), resulting in initial friendly contact with the Polynesians that quickly turned violent, leading to 200 local deaths in the first two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 December 1642:&lt;/strong&gt; Abel Tasman&amp;rsquo;s first voyage led to contact between the Dutch and the Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri in New Zealand. The encounter resulted in the death of four Dutch and the wounding of one Māori, with no further communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 January 1788:&lt;/strong&gt; James Cook&amp;rsquo;s third voyage brought the British into contact with the Native Hawaiians on Kauai, Hawaii. General friendly trade occurred, but one Indigenous Hawaiian was killed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 January 1788:&lt;/strong&gt; The First Fleet&amp;rsquo;s arrival in Sydney, Australia, led to contact between the British Empire and the Cadigal and Bidjigal peoples. The initial contact was friendly but reserved, with one aborigine likely beaten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 November 1791:&lt;/strong&gt; William R. Broughton led a British expedition to Chatham Island, New Zealand, resulting in contact with the Moriori people. Initial shows of aggression by the Moriori were followed by peaceful relations, but a fight led to the death of one Moriori.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1930:&lt;/strong&gt; Mick Leahy led an Australian expedition to the New Guinea Highlands, resulting in contact with the Papuan people. The contact was friendly, with some Highland people believing the Australians were their ancestors and attempting to rub off their white skins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details a series of sightings from August to September 1914, where numerous South Africans reported seeing a nighttime monoplane. These sightings occurred during the lead-up to the South West Africa campaign of World War I, leading to speculation that it was a German spy plane. However, the origin of the plane remained unknown, leading some to consider mass hysteria as a possible explanation. Key locations include various parts of South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

The film was analyzed by Ground Saucer Watch (GSW), which found no evidence of a hoax but couldn&amp;rsquo;t definitively identify the objects due to a lack of reference points. Other experts suggested the objects were Jupiter and Arcturus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details an account from 815 AD in Lyons, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

&lt;p&gt;This section covers an event on October 17, 1952, in Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Multiple witnesses reported a cigar-shaped UFO accompanied by 30 disc-shaped objects.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1954&#34;&gt;1954 &lt;a href=&#34;#1954&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details two separate incidents. The first, on July 1, 1965, in Valensole, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, involves farmer Maurice Masse&amp;rsquo;s alleged close encounter. Masse claimed to have encountered two small beings near a spherical vehicle. He said he was paralyzed by one of the beings and watched them examining plants. UFOlogists consider this case significant, citing &amp;ldquo;landing gear impressions&amp;rdquo; found in the soil. The second incident occurred in September 1965 in Fort-de-France, Martinique, where hundreds of witnesses observed a ball or disk of light moving slowly across the sky, leaving a glowing trail. Michel Figuet, a helmsman in the French fleet, reported the sighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the Trans-en-Provence Case on January 8, 1981, in Trans-en-Provence, Var. UFOlogists consider this case significant due to alleged material traces left by a UFO. Critics suggest the traces were a hoax or caused by tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1982&#34;&gt;1982 &lt;a href=&#34;#1982&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details an account from 815 in Lyons, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, referencing the writings of Carolingian archbishop Agobard of Lyons. Agobard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;De Grandine et Tonitruis&lt;/em&gt; describes beliefs in a region called Magonia, from which ships supposedly came in the clouds, transporting fruits lost to hail and storms. The account also mentions people who claimed to have captured individuals who fell from these ships and were about to be stoned before the truth prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1952&#34;&gt;1952 &lt;a href=&#34;#1952&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on an event in Oloron-Sainte-Marie on October 17, 1952. Multiple witnesses reported seeing a cigar-shaped UFO accompanied by approximately 30 disc-shaped objects. These objects allegedly dropped a white siliceous cotton-like substance that covered trees and roofs. The event was met with skepticism, with some suggesting it was an optical phenomenon or caused by migrating spiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1954&#34;&gt;1954 &lt;a href=&#34;#1954&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

He said he was paralyzed by one of the beings and observed them making grunting sounds while examining plants. Masse considered the encounter a spiritual experience. UFOlogists cite &amp;ldquo;landing gear impressions&amp;rdquo; as evidence. The second incident occurred in Fort-de-France, Martinique, in late September 1965. Hundreds of witnesses saw a ball or disk of light moving slowly across the sky, leaving a glowing trail. Michel Figuet, a helmsman in the French fleet, reported the sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1967&#34;&gt;1967 &lt;a href=&#34;#1967&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the Close encounter of Cussac on August 29, 1967, in Cantal. Two young children claimed to have witnessed a UFO and its occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1976&#34;&gt;1976 &lt;a href=&#34;#1976&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts an event on November 5, 1976, near Rives/Voreppe, Isère. A French physicist, Dr. S., reported seeing a luminous disk moving in the sky, brighter than the full moon. The object&amp;rsquo;s distance was estimated between 9 and 36 kilometers. The same phenomenon was observed by multiple people over a 250-kilometer stretch from Clermont-Ferrand to Grenoble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1978&#34;&gt;1978 &lt;a href=&#34;#1978&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details an incident on June 19, 1978, in Gujan-Mestras, Gironde. Several people witnessed a UAP that allegedly caused a city-wide blackout. The local police and GEPAN investigated the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1981&#34;&gt;1981 &lt;a href=&#34;#1981&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the Trans-en-Provence Case from January 8, 1981, in Var. This case is considered significant by UFOlogists due to alleged material traces left by a UFO. Skeptics dismiss the event as a joke and attribute the traces to tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1982&#34;&gt;1982 &lt;a href=&#34;#1982&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes an event on October 21, 1982, in Nancy, France. A biologist witnessed an ovoid object descending into a garden and hovering above the ground. After 20 minutes, the object silently ascended. The witness reported that the grass under the object stood up straight and nearby amaranth plants withered. The Gendarmerie investigated and took samples, which GEPAN analyzed, finding dehydration but no radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-ufo-sightings-in-the-czech-republic&#34;&gt;List of UFO Sightings in the Czech Republic &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-ufo-sightings-in-the-czech-republic&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article documents alleged UFO sightings in the Czech Republic, spanning from 1976 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1976-radkov&#34;&gt;1976, Radkov &lt;a href=&#34;#1976-radkov&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, a family in Radkov witnessed a triangular, boomerang-shaped UFO while at a campfire. Two years later, a similar object was reportedly pursued by a military aircraft from Žatec over Western Bohemia, without success. In 1992, similar objects were observed in Cheb, near Prague, and near Dvůr Králové.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1987-vranov&#34;&gt;1987, Vranov &lt;a href=&#34;#1987-vranov&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vranov UFO incident, considered the most famous in the Czech Republic, occurred on July 12, 1987, in Vranov nad Dyjí above the Vranov Reservoir. A helicopter regiment was ordered to pursue a black, cigar-shaped object first located near the Austrian border. Pilots were instructed to shoot it down, but the object&amp;rsquo;s erratic movements and the presence of vacationers below prevented them. First Lieutenant Jaroslav Špaček reported the object flew towards their helicopter, forcing them to dodge it. The object then moved at high speed over Brno, Jaslovské Bohunice, and Bratislava before disappearing from radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1991-miličín&#34;&gt;1991, Miličín &lt;a href=&#34;#1991-mili%c4%8d%c3%adn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 12, 1991, a glowing round object was sighted near Miličín, causing panic among the local population. The sphere appeared randomly and silently followed people. Some witnesses reported seeing figures within the sphere, who allegedly left the sphere to &amp;ldquo;repair&amp;rdquo; something on a cottage roof, leaving behind large, four-fingered footprints. A local pastor reportedly told people it was a divine miracle and to remain silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1992-tři-sekery&#34;&gt;1992, Tři Sekery &lt;a href=&#34;#1992-t%c5%99i-sekery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 1992, military radars detected an object approaching the Czechoslovak border from Germany, crossing near Tři Sekery and heading towards Hvozd. Fighter jets and helicopters were dispatched, but despite radar visibility and ground observers, pilots could not locate the object. The object reportedly headed towards Chomutov and disappeared near Jirkov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1993-borová&#34;&gt;1993, Borová &lt;a href=&#34;#1993-borov%c3%a1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 21, 1993, a man in Borová encountered a flatfish-shaped object hovering above the road. The object then moved and floated noiselessly. The following day, numerous UFO sightings of various shapes and sizes were reported across the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2009&#34;&gt;2009 &lt;a href=&#34;#2009&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During late May 2009, multiple reports of flying objects emerged from various locations in the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 23, 2009, four people near Klínovec saw four orange lights flying at equal intervals. Similar objects were seen later that night above Chrást near Plzeň.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 24, 2009, people in Říčany observed three glowing spheres in the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 25, 2009, a university professor, who wished to remain anonymous, reported seeing disc-shaped objects resembling car high beams above the Brno highway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article documents alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1994&#34;&gt;1994 &lt;a href=&#34;#1994&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on &amp;ldquo;The Meng Zhaoguo Incident,&amp;rdquo; a purported close encounter of the third kind that Meng Zhaoguo claimed to have experienced in Phoenix Mountain, Wuchang, Heilongjiang. In 1994, Meng reported seeing a white, shining object descend into the mountain. He claimed to have been harassed by entities, taken aboard their spacecraft, and forced to copulate. He also stated that he was shown images of Jupiter, which the entities claimed was their homeworld. The UFO Enthusiasts Club at Wuhan University examined his story and concluded that while the initial contact might have occurred, the subsequent events were likely untrue. Other UFO groups in China, however, believed his claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2010&#34;&gt;2010 &lt;a href=&#34;#2010&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details a UFO sighting that occurred on July 7 above Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport near Hangzhou. The airport was temporarily closed due to the sighting. An investigation found no radar images and determined that the purported images of the UFO were not taken near the airport. The investigation concluded that the object may have been an aircraft, possibly military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1989-1990&#34;&gt;1989-1990 &lt;a href=&#34;#1989-1990&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the Belgian UFO wave, a period of intense UFO activity. The main feature of this wave was the frequent reports of triangular UFOs observed across the country. These objects were even pursued by Belgian Air Force F-16 fighter jets, and some photographs were taken. One speculative explanation suggested these sightings might have been misidentified stealth aircraft, specifically the F-117 Nighthawk, using Belgian highways for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1990-03-30&#34;&gt;1990-03-30 &lt;a href=&#34;#1990-03-30&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details a specific mass sighting event that occurred on March 30, 1990, in Ans, Wallonia. Numerous witnesses reported seeing large, silent, low-flying black triangles. These objects were tracked by multiple NATO radar systems and intercepted by jet fighters. The Belgian military investigated the incident, and photographic evidence is said to exist. A close encounter was also reported during this event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-the-nation-of-argentina&#34;&gt;List of alleged UFO sightings in the nation of Argentina &lt;a href=&#34;#list-of-alleged-ufo-sightings-in-the-nation-of-argentina&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents a compilation of reported UFO sightings in Argentina, spanning from 1962 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;may-1962&#34;&gt;May 1962 &lt;a href=&#34;#may-1962&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details several UFO sightings that occurred in May 1962, primarily around Bahía Blanca. Key events include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sightings at the Espora Air Base on May 11 and 18.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An encounter on Route 35 where three truck drivers witnessed an illuminated object rising from a field and dividing into two parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A photograph taken by Miguel Tohmé in Bahía Blanca on May 21, depicting a UFO &amp;ldquo;the size of a soccer ball.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sightings at the Port Belgrano Naval Base between May 21 and 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;16-july-1965&#34;&gt;16 July 1965 &lt;a href=&#34;#16-july-1965&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a sighting in Buenos Aires on July 16, 1965, where two bright disks were observed remaining stationary before flying away at high speed. The Seventh Air Brigade dispatched three Gloster Meteor aircraft from Morón Air Base to investigate, but the search yielded no results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-december-1965&#34;&gt;1 December 1965 &lt;a href=&#34;#1-december-1965&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section refers to the Adhara Observatory UFO Lunar Transit. On December 1, 1965, at 8:30 pm, the Adhara Observatory in San Miguel, Buenos Aires province, received calls about strange objects visible on the moon. Photographs taken by the observatory staff revealed disk-shaped objects flying in front of the moon. Some experts suggest these objects may have been caused by film processing errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;27-october-1973&#34;&gt;27 October 1973 &lt;a href=&#34;#27-october-1973&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts the experience of truck driver Dionisio Llanca, who was admitted to the Municipal Hospital of Bahía Blanca on October 30. Llanca claimed that on October 27, he encountered an intense light while changing a tire on his way to Río Gallegos, which paralyzed him. He reported seeing an object in the sky and beings who subjected him to medical testing. He awoke hours later approximately 9 kilometers away. UFO researcher Fabio Zerpa investigated the case and published it in his book &lt;em&gt;El Reino Subterráneo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-january-1986&#34;&gt;9 January 1986 &lt;a href=&#34;#9-january-1986&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses an alleged UFO landing on Mount Pajarillo, near Capilla del Monte. An 11-year-old local child, Gabriel Gomez, witnessed the event. The following day, a circular footprint, known as “Huella del Pajarillo,” appeared near Cerro Uritorco, believed to be the result of a UFO landing that burned the area in a circular shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;25-december-1988&#34;&gt;25 December 1988 &lt;a href=&#34;#25-december-1988&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes a sighting over Villa Urquiza, Buenos Aires, where a silver UFO flew over the high-density area. This event is considered one of Argentina&amp;rsquo;s most spectacular UFO incidents, with over 7,500 witnesses. The local airport reported an object flying west towards General Paz Avenue, detected on radar on that sunny afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-september-2023&#34;&gt;5 September 2023 &lt;a href=&#34;#5-september-2023&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details an incident at the Espora Air Base near Bahía Blanca. On that night, four black, triangular UFOs allegedly flew over the base and were engaged with gunfire by military personnel. One object reportedly fired a laser, injuring two or three soldiers. The Base denied the incident, claiming that videos and audios circulating were edited fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Close encounter</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_6e704c7ca402/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 01:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_6e704c7ca402/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;close-encounter&#34;&gt;Close Encounter &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounter&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close encounter, in ufology, is defined as an event where a person witnesses an unidentified flying object (UFO) at close range, reducing the likelihood of misidentification. The term and classification system were introduced by astronomer and UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek in his 1972 book, &lt;em&gt;The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry&lt;/em&gt;. While others have expanded on Hynek&amp;rsquo;s original categories, these extensions haven&amp;rsquo;t gained widespread acceptance due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor. Sightings beyond 150 meters are generally classified as &lt;em&gt;daylight discs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nocturnal lights&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;radar/visual reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hyneks-scale&#34;&gt;Hynek&amp;rsquo;s Scale &lt;a href=&#34;#hyneks-scale&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek created a six-level classification system for UFO sightings, arranged by proximity. The categories include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nocturnal Lights:&lt;/strong&gt; Unexplained lights observed in the night sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daylight Discs:&lt;/strong&gt; UFOs seen during the day, typically disc-shaped or oval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radar-Visual:&lt;/strong&gt; UFO sightings confirmed by radar, intended to provide more concrete evidence, though atmospheric anomalies can sometimes explain radar propagation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Encounters of the First Kind (CE1):&lt;/strong&gt; Visual sightings of a UFO at close range (less than 150 meters), displaying appreciable angular extension and detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Encounters of the Second Kind (CE2):&lt;/strong&gt; UFO events involving physical effects, such as interference with vehicles or electronics, animal reactions, physiological effects on witnesses, or physical traces like ground impressions or scorched vegetation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind (CE3):&lt;/strong&gt; UFO encounters where animated entities are present, including humanoids, robots, or humans seemingly associated with the UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bloecher-subtypes&#34;&gt;Bloecher Subtypes &lt;a href=&#34;#bloecher-subtypes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Bloecher proposed six subtypes for Close Encounters of the Third Kind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aboard:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed only inside the UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed both inside and outside the UFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed near a UFO, but not entering or exiting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed without any UFOs being seen, but UFO activity has been reported in the area around the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excluded:&lt;/strong&gt; An entity is observed, but no UFOs are seen, and no UFO activity has been reported in the area at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequence:&lt;/strong&gt; No entity or UFOs are observed, but the subject experiences some form of &amp;ldquo;intelligent communication.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extensions-of-hyneks-scale&#34;&gt;Extensions of Hynek&amp;rsquo;s Scale &lt;a href=&#34;#extensions-of-hyneks-scale&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Hynek&amp;rsquo;s death in 1986, Jacques Vallee expanded the classification system by adding Close Encounters of the Fourth and Fifth Kinds, detailed in his 1990 book, &lt;em&gt;Confrontations: A Scientist&amp;rsquo;s Search for Alien Contact&lt;/em&gt;. These extensions were quickly adopted by the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-fourth-kind-ce4&#34;&gt;Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind (CE4) &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-fourth-kind-ce4&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CE4 involves a human being abducted by a UFO or its occupants. Jacques Vallée suggested that the &amp;ldquo;fourth kind&amp;rdquo; should encompass cases where witnesses experience a transformation of their sense of reality, including non-abduction events with absurd, hallucinatory, or dreamlike elements associated with UFO encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-fifth-kind-ce5&#34;&gt;Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (CE5) &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-fifth-kind-ce5&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vallee&amp;rsquo;s original definition, a CE5 occurs when an alien abductee experiences a physical effect from the encounter, such as injury or healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate interpretation, popularized by Steven M. Greer, defines CE5 as human-initiated contact with extraterrestrial life forms or advanced interstellar civilizations, involving direct communication between aliens and humans. This involves individuals or groups using specific protocols, primarily contact meditation and sounds or signals, to establish communication or interaction with extraterrestrial beings. This is also referred to as human-initiated close encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;close-encounters-of-the-sixth-kind-ce6&#34;&gt;Close Encounters of the Sixth Kind (CE6) &lt;a href=&#34;#close-encounters-of-the-sixth-kind-ce6&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term describes a sexual encounter between a human and an extraterrestrial species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show has faced criticism from reviewers and organizations. Jason Colavito criticized the show for lacking a clear thesis and for Tsoukalos&amp;rsquo; apparent skepticism towards his interviewees&amp;rsquo; claims. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), through Alexander Zaitchik&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Hatewatch&lt;/em&gt; blog, has criticized shows like &lt;em&gt;In Search of Aliens&lt;/em&gt; for promoting &amp;ldquo;racist pseudo-scholarship&amp;rdquo; and raising the profile of figures like Jan Udo Holey, whose antisemitic works have been banned in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;flying-saucer&#34;&gt;Flying Saucer &lt;a href=&#34;#flying-saucer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flying saucer, or flying disc, is a purported type of disc-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO). The term originated in 1947 when US news media reported pilot Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s claim of seeing objects flying near his airplane over Washington State. The news reports included implausible speed estimates and preceded a wave of sightings across the US, including the Roswell incident and the Flight 105 UFO sighting. A National Guard pilot died in 1948 while pursuing a flying saucer. Civilian research groups and conspiracy theories developed around the topic, and the concept spread to other countries. Early reports speculated about secret military technology, but flying saucers became associated with aliens by 1950. The terms unidentified flying object (UFO) and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) have gradually replaced the term over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aerial photo taken over Lake Cote, Costa Rica, by Sergio Loaiza in 1971 is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science fiction, UFO sightings, UFO conspiracy theories, and popular culture, saucers are typically piloted by nonhuman beings. Most reported sightings describe saucers in the distance and do not mention a crew. Descriptions of the craft vary considerably. Early reports emphasized speed, but the descriptions shifted over the decades to the objects mostly hovering. They are generally said to be round, sometimes with a protrusion on top, but details of the shape vary between reports. Witnesses describe flying saucers as silent or deafening, with lights of every color, and flying alone or in formation. Size estimates range from small enough to fit in a living room to over 2,000 feet (610 m) in diameter. Sightings are most frequent at night. Astronomer Donald Howard Menzel concluded that the reports were too varied to all be describing the same type of objects. Experts have identified most reported saucers as known phenomena, including astronomical objects such as Venus, airborne objects such as balloons, and optical phenomena such as sun dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1950s pop culture embraced flying saucers. The discs appeared in film, television, literature, music, toys, and advertising. Their reports influenced religious movements and were the subject of military investigations. The shape became visual shorthand for alien invaders. During the 1960s, saucers waned in popularity as UFOs were reported and depicted in other shapes. Discs ceased to be viewed as the standard shape for alien spacecraft but are still often depicted, sometimes for their retro value to evoke the early Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of fantastical aircraft predate the first flying saucers. In antiquity, mysterious lights in the sky were interpreted as spiritual phenomena. In the 1800s, many newspapers reported massive airships with glowing lights and humming engines. These are often seen as precursors to flying saucer and UFO sightings. On January 25, 1878, the &lt;em&gt;Denison Daily News&lt;/em&gt; printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, reported an object resembling a balloon flying &amp;ldquo;at wonderful speed&amp;rdquo;. The newspaper said it appeared to be about the size of a saucer from his perspective, one of the first uses of the word &amp;ldquo;saucer&amp;rdquo; in association with a UFO. An outbreak of a number of sightings of mystery airships occurred in America in 1896 and 1897. During World War II, Allied pilots reported balls of light following their planes. They named the lights foo fighters and believed they were advanced Axis aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of the typical flying saucer first appeared in science fiction. French sociologist Bertrand Méheust noted Jean de La Hire&amp;rsquo;s 1908 novel &lt;em&gt;La Roue fulgurante&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Lightning Wheel&lt;/em&gt;). In the novel, a flying disc-shaped machine abducts the protagonists via a beam of light. Science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&lt;/em&gt; began publishing &amp;ldquo;The Shaver Mystery&amp;rdquo; in 1945. Written by Richard Sharpe Shaver and edited by Raymond A. Palmer, they were science fiction tales about technologically advanced &amp;ldquo;detrimental robots&amp;rdquo; that abducted humans, but the stories were presented as a true account of Shaver&amp;rsquo;s life. Until the magazine ceased printing The Shaver Mystery, &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; letter column was regularly full of readers sharing their own purportedly true sightings of the robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the flying saucer was coined as a term, fantasy artwork in pulp magazines depicted flying discs. Skeptical physicist Milton Rothman noted the appearance of so-called flying saucers in the fantasy artwork of 1930s pulp science fiction magazines, by artists such as Frank R. Paul. One of Paul&amp;rsquo;s earliest depictions of a flying saucer appeared on the cover of the November 1929 issue of Hugo Gernsback&amp;rsquo;s pulp science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Science Wonder Stories&lt;/em&gt;. Science fiction illustrator Frank Wu wrote that the idea of space vehicles shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins &lt;a href=&#34;#origins&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern flying saucer concept, including the association with aliens, can be traced to the 1947 Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. On June 24, 1947, businessman and amateur pilot Kenneth Arnold landed at the Yakima, Washington airstrip. He told staff and friends that he&amp;rsquo;d seen nine unusual airborne objects. Arnold estimated their speed at 1,700 miles per hour, beyond the capabilities of known aircraft. Newspapers soon contacted Arnold for interviews. The &lt;em&gt;East Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; reported his supposed aircraft as &amp;ldquo;saucer-like&amp;rdquo;. In a June 26 radio interview, Arnold described them as &amp;ldquo;something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear&amp;rdquo;. Headline writers coined the terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying disk&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;disc&amp;rdquo;) for the story. Arnold later told CBS News that the early coverage &amp;ldquo;did not quote me properly [&amp;hellip;] when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water. Most of the newspapers misunderstood and misquoted that, too. They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion.&amp;rdquo; The circular shape of typical flying saucers may be due to reporters mistaking Arnold&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;saucer-like&amp;rdquo; description of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold&amp;rsquo;s story preceded a wave of hundreds of flying saucer reports. Lieutenant Governor of Idaho Donald S. Whitehead claimed he saw a fast-moving object resembling a meteor around the time of Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. In early July, head of Air Materiel Command Nathan F. Twining told reporters that &amp;ldquo;anyone seeing the objects&amp;rdquo; should contact Wright Field. The next widely publicized report was the sighting by a United Airlines crew on July 4 of nine more disc-like objects pacing their plane over Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public was divided on the potential origin of the saucers. Arnold told military intelligence officers he suspected the discs were experimental aircraft, and early newspapers reported Arnold saying, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they were—unless they were guided missiles.&amp;rdquo; News media speculated on a Soviet origin, and many war veterans connected them to the foo fighters seen during World War II. A Gallup Poll found that 90% of Americans were aware of the saucer stories, and 16 percent believed they were secret military weapons, most likely American. The most common explanation given was some type of illusion or mirage. Less than one percent believed they were alien craft. One report from Seattle, Washington, described a hammer and sickle painted onto a flying disc. The stories spread to other countries, where they were influenced by local political and social concerns. In Europe, which was still recovering from the Second World War, saucers were often reported with rocket-like features. German newspapers reported flying saucers that exploded or had tails of fire. The names for the discs were largely derived from the English &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; including the French &lt;em&gt;soucoupe volante&lt;/em&gt;, Spanish &lt;em&gt;platillo volante&lt;/em&gt;, Portuguese &lt;em&gt;disco voador&lt;/em&gt;, Swedish &lt;em&gt;flygande tefat&lt;/em&gt;, German &lt;em&gt;fliegende Untertasse&lt;/em&gt;, and Italian &lt;em&gt;disco volante&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1947 sightings peaked in the days after the Fourth of July and declined rapidly through mid-July. Multiple organizations offered $1,000 rewards for hard proof. In the widely reported July 7, 1947, Twin Falls saucer hoax, four teenagers in Idaho fabricated a crashed disc from jukebox parts. On July 8, the Army Air Force base at Roswell, New Mexico, issued a press release saying that they had recovered a &amp;ldquo;flying disc&amp;rdquo; from a nearby ranch; the so-called Roswell UFO incident made front-page news. International media covered the military&amp;rsquo;s announcement of a crashed disc, but within 24 hours were reporting the military&amp;rsquo;s retraction and explanation that the material was balloon debris. By July 11, the most widely reported story was a North Hollywood resident&amp;rsquo;s claim that a 30-inch galvanized iron disc containing glass radio tubes had crashed in his garden. Newspapers quoted Fire Battalion Chief Wallace Newcombe&amp;rsquo;s assessment, &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look to me like it could fly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Air Force collected over a hundred reports at Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Air Force General Nathan Twining established Project SAUCER, later renamed Project Sign, the first in a series of UFO investigations by the US Government. Other national governments followed suit. Canada began Project Magnet and the United Kingdom launched the Flying Saucer Working Party in 1950, which attributed saucer reports to meteorological phenomena, astronomical phenomena, misidentification, optical illusions, misconceptions, or hoaxes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mariana UFO incident occurred in August 1950 in Great Falls, Montana. It involves a sighting filmed by local baseball coach Nick Mariana, considered among the first motion picture footage of a UFO. The U.S. Air Force initially claimed the objects were reflections of two F-94 jet fighters, a claim they later retracted and then endorsed again. Multiple investigations have yielded inconclusive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 15, 1950, at 11:29 am, Nick Mariana and his secretary, Virginia Raunig, spotted two bright, silvery objects rotating while flying over Great Falls at an estimated speed of 200 to 400 miles per hour. Mariana filmed the objects for sixteen seconds using his 16 mm movie camera. The &lt;em&gt;Great Falls Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reported the sighting the next day, and Mariana showed the film to local groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;air-force-investigation&#34;&gt;Air Force Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#air-force-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;em&gt;Great Falls Tribune&lt;/em&gt; informed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base about the sighting, Captain John P. Brynildsen interviewed Mariana and Raunig at Malmstrom AFB. Brynildsen sent the film to Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis. The Air Force initially determined the objects were reflections from two F-94 jet fighters. However, controversy arose when Mariana claimed the first thirty-five frames of his film, which clearly showed the UFOs as rotating disks, were missing. The Air Force denied removing more than a single damaged frame. Edward J. Ruppelt, who later headed Project Blue Book, noted the initial lack of Air Force interest in the UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lawsuit&#34;&gt;Lawsuit &lt;a href=&#34;#lawsuit&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1951, Bob Considine, a writer and UFO skeptic, wrote an article for &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/em&gt; debunking famous UFO sightings, including Mariana&amp;rsquo;s. Mariana filed a slander lawsuit against Considine, which was eventually dropped in September 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;later-studies&#34;&gt;Later Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#later-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 1952, Ruppelt convinced Mariana to allow the Air Force to reanalyze the film. Analysts at Wright-Patterson AFB ruled out birds, balloons, meteors, and reflections from F-94 jets. Ruppelt concluded the film showed an unknown object. In January 1953, the Robertson Panel, convened by the Air Force and CIA, judged the objects to be reflections of aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;baker-analysis&#34;&gt;Baker Analysis &lt;a href=&#34;#baker-analysis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1954, Greene-Rouse Productions hired Robert M.L. Baker, Jr. of Douglas Aircraft to analyze Mariana&amp;rsquo;s film for a documentary. Baker concluded that the jet reflection explanation was strained. In 1968, Baker testified before a Congressional hearing on UFOs, stating that his analysis excluded most natural phenomena. In 1969, at an AAAS UFO panel, Baker presented a paper concluding the Mariana film was unidentifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condon-report&#34;&gt;Condon Report &lt;a href=&#34;#condon-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, the U.S. government funded a study of the UFO phenomenon at the University of Colorado, chaired by Edward U. Condon. Roy Craig, a skeptical physicist, and David Saunders, a psychologist interested in the Mariana incident, reinvestigated the film. They disagreed on the film&amp;rsquo;s authenticity and the removal of frames. William Hartmann, an astronomer, analyzed the film and suggested airplanes remained the principal working hypothesis, though he acknowledged arguments against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of Mariana&amp;rsquo;s film are in the US National Archives. The film is featured in documentaries and online, and continues to be debated. Great Falls, Montana, has had over 100 UFO sightings since Mariana&amp;rsquo;s incident. In 2008, the minor league baseball team in Great Falls was renamed the Great Falls Voyagers in honor of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-britney-spears-song&#34;&gt;Alien (Britney Spears song) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-britney-spears-song&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; is a song by Britney Spears from her 2013 album &lt;em&gt;Britney Jean&lt;/em&gt;. The song is a mid-tempo dance-pop track about Spears&amp;rsquo; feelings of loneliness. It received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its production and personal nature. Despite not being released as a single, it charted on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 and the French Singles Chart. Spears performed the song during her &amp;ldquo;Britney: Piece of Me&amp;rdquo; residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her time as a judge on &lt;em&gt;The X Factor&lt;/em&gt;, Spears began working on her eighth studio album in December 2012. William Orbit was announced as a producer for the project in May 2013. Spears described &amp;ldquo;Alien,&amp;rdquo; her collaboration with Orbit, as &amp;ldquo;really cool&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;really great.&amp;rdquo; There were initial rumors of a collaboration with Lady Gaga, but this did not happen. A demo version of the song leaked online before the album&amp;rsquo;s release, which Orbit stated had incorrect chorus notes that were fixed in the final version. Spears considered releasing &amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; as a single, as revealed in her documentary &lt;em&gt;I Am Britney Jean&lt;/em&gt;, but this never materialized. In July 2014, an unedited vocal track of Spears singing the song leaked, drawing criticism for her uncorrected vocals. Orbit defended Spears, stating that the leaked audio was a vocal warm-up and not intended for public release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; is a midtempo dance-pop song co-written by Spears, William Orbit, Dan Traynor, Ana Diaz, and Anthony Preston, and produced by Orbit and HyGrade. The song&amp;rsquo;s musical style has been compared to Madonna&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ray of Light&lt;/em&gt; album, which was also produced by Orbit. Lyrically, the song explores themes of loneliness. A vocal glitch at 2:14 in the song sparked discussion, with Orbit joking that it was due to an alien abduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; was generally well-received by music critics, who praised its production and personal themes. Critics highlighted Orbit&amp;rsquo;s production and Spears&amp;rsquo; vulnerability on the track. Some reviewers compared the song favorably to Madonna&amp;rsquo;s work with Orbit. However, one critic felt that Spears&amp;rsquo; vocal performance did not match the song&amp;rsquo;s solemn production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spears performed &amp;ldquo;Alien&amp;rdquo; during her &amp;ldquo;Britney: Piece of Me&amp;rdquo; residency at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. One performance was notable because Spears was caught lip-syncing when the backing track continued playing after she missed her cue. The song was later removed from the setlist but was briefly re-added following Spears&amp;rsquo; breakup with her boyfriend David Lucado.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;levelland-ufo-case&#34;&gt;Levelland UFO Case &lt;a href=&#34;#levelland-ufo-case&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levelland UFO case occurred on November 2–3, 1957, around Levelland, Texas. It is considered a notable UFO incident due to the number of witnesses. The US Air Force attributed the sightings to ball lightning or a severe electrical storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reports&#34;&gt;Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 2, 1957, Pedro Saucedo and Joe Salaz reported a UFO sighting to the Levelland police department, claiming their truck&amp;rsquo;s engine died when a blue flash of light and a rocket-shaped object approached. Motorist Jim Wheeler reported a large, egg-shaped object blocking the road, causing his vehicle to stall. A married couple reported a bright flash of light that caused their headlights and radio to fail temporarily. Texas Technological College student Newell Wright encountered a 100-foot-long egg-shaped object that caused his car engine to sputter and die. Farmer Frank Williams reported a glowing object that caused his car&amp;rsquo;s lights and motor to stop. Ronald Martin and James Long also reported similar encounters with a brightly lit object. Sheriff Weir Clem saw a red object moving across the sky, and Fire Chief Ray Jones experienced vehicle malfunctions. The Levelland police department received a total of 15 UFO-related reports during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-air-force-investigation&#34;&gt;U.S. Air Force Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#us-air-force-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levelland sightings were investigated by Project Blue Book. An Air Force sergeant spent seven hours investigating, interviewing Saucedo, Wheeler, and Wright. The Air Force concluded that a severe electrical storm, possibly ball lightning or St. Elmo&amp;rsquo;s fire, caused the sightings and auto failures, blaming engine failures on wet electrical circuits. Donald H. Menzel agreed with the Air Force explanation, attributing the events to ball lightning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufologists&#34;&gt;Ufologists &lt;a href=&#34;#ufologists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James E. McDonald and J. Allen Hynek disputed the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s explanation, arguing that there was no electrical storm. McDonald testified that ten vehicles were stopped independently within a short area and time. Hynek concurred initially but later recognized the lack of evidence that ball lightning could stop cars and put out headlights. Ufologists also noted that the Air Force investigator did not interview nine of the fifteen witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2002, KDFW aired a report about the Levelland UFO case, interviewing Sheriff Weir Clem&amp;rsquo;s widow and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time-traveler UFO hypothesis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_4666fb28cb0a/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;time-traveler-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Time-traveler UFO hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#time-traveler-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time-traveler hypothesis, also known as chrononaut UFO, future humans, extratempestrial model, and Terminator theory, proposes that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are humans traveling from the future using advanced technology. This concept has gained recent attention from figures like retired NASA aerospace engineer Larry Lemke, Wisconsin congressman Mike Gallagher, and filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Mainstream scholars consider this hypothesis extremely implausible, and it&amp;rsquo;s generally viewed as unorthodox even among fringe conspiracy theorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;antecedents&#34;&gt;Antecedents &lt;a href=&#34;#antecedents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the origins of the ideas that led to the time-traveler UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins-of-time-travel-speculation&#34;&gt;Origins of time travel speculation &lt;a href=&#34;#origins-of-time-travel-speculation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection traces the concept of time travel from the future to the past back to its literary origins. Pierre Boitard&amp;rsquo;s 1861 book &lt;em&gt;Paris avant les hommes&lt;/em&gt; is credited with introducing the idea, featuring a man sent back to prehistoric Earth. Camille Flammarion&amp;rsquo;s 1887 novel &lt;em&gt;Lumen&lt;/em&gt; also explored the theme of a soul traveling through different historical periods. The section also notes that while time travel is considered physically impossible by most, theoretical research continues to explore its potential feasibility, with scientists like J. Richard Gott and Ronald Mallet speculating on the possibility of future human time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;speculation-of-future-human-evolution&#34;&gt;Speculation of future human evolution &lt;a href=&#34;#speculation-of-future-human-evolution&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection discusses the history of speculation about the future evolution of mankind. It highlights H.G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt; as an early example of both time travel and speculative evolution. Other authors mentioned include Edgar Rice Burroughs, Olaf Stapledon, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Baxter, and Cevdet Mehmet Kösemen. The section also identifies climate change, the technological singularity, space travel, and genetic enhancement as potential factors that could alter human evolution, leading to transhuman and posthuman scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ufos-and-initial-explanations&#34;&gt;UFOs and initial explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#ufos-and-initial-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection provides a brief overview of the history of UFO sightings. It mentions reports of unknown objects in the skies dating back to antiquity, as well as the mystery airship sightings of the 1890s and the Foo fighters and ghost rockets during World War II. The modern UFO era is said to have begun in the summer of 1947, following Kenneth Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting. Initial explanations for these sightings ranged from novel US or Soviet technology to misidentification of mundane objects and mass hysteria. Fringe theories included extraterrestrial or interdimensional origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;formation-and-spread&#34;&gt;Formation and spread &lt;a href=&#34;#formation-and-spread&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the development and popularization of the time-traveler UFO hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implausibility-of-humanoid-aliens&#34;&gt;Implausibility of humanoid aliens &lt;a href=&#34;#implausibility-of-humanoid-aliens&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection addresses the common depiction of aliens as humanoids in contactee and alien abduction folklore. It cites George Gaylord Simpson&amp;rsquo;s 1964 article &lt;em&gt;The Nonprevalence of Humanoids&lt;/em&gt;, which argues that it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely for extraterrestrial intelligence to exist and even more unlikely for it to be humanoid. The section also mentions Stephen Jay Gould&amp;rsquo;s thought experiment about rewinding evolution, suggesting that humans would likely not evolve again. Biologist Jack Cohen&amp;rsquo;s view on the implausibility of Grey aliens evolving a physiology similar to humans is also included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-popularization&#34;&gt;Modern popularization &lt;a href=&#34;#modern-popularization&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection explores the modern resurgence of the time-traveler hypothesis. It mentions Jacques Vallée&amp;rsquo;s 1975 book &lt;em&gt;The Invisible College&lt;/em&gt; as an early example. Other figures and works mentioned include David S. Anderson, Jenny Randles, James Herbert Brennan, and Philip J. Corso and William J. Birnes&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;The Day After Roswell&lt;/em&gt;, which reported Hermann Oberth&amp;rsquo;s belief that the Roswell craft could have been a time machine. The History channel series &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt; is also mentioned for its episodes exploring the concept. Michael P. Masters&amp;rsquo; book &lt;em&gt;Identified Flying Objects&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Extratempestrial Model&lt;/em&gt; are highlighted for their in-depth exploration of the hypothesis. Tim Peake and Steven Spielberg are mentioned for their recent public comments on the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection lists examples of the time-traveler hypothesis in popular culture. It includes the TV series &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s About Time&lt;/em&gt;, Gregory Benford&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Timescape&lt;/em&gt;, David Drake&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Sphere&lt;/em&gt;, the TV film &lt;em&gt;Official Denial&lt;/em&gt;, the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Blake and Mortimer&lt;/em&gt;, the band Yes, Jordan Peele&amp;rsquo;s movie &lt;em&gt;Nope&lt;/em&gt;, and the movie &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terminology-and-connection-to-other-theories&#34;&gt;Terminology and connection to other theories &lt;a href=&#34;#terminology-and-connection-to-other-theories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection clarifies the terminology used to describe the hypothesis, noting that while Michael P. Masters uses the term &amp;ldquo;extratempestrial,&amp;rdquo; the overall idea is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;the time-traveler hypothesis.&amp;rdquo; It also discusses the overlap between the time-traveler hypothesis and the interdimensional hypothesis, with figures like John Ventre and Harold E. Puthoff using the terms interchangeably. The section also notes that the time-traveler hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for the absence of future time travelers, similar to how the extraterrestrial hypothesis addresses Fermi&amp;rsquo;s paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criticism&#34;&gt;Criticism &lt;a href=&#34;#criticism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents criticisms of the time-traveler hypothesis. It notes that the hypothesis is considered pseudoscientific. Neil deGrasse Tyson is quoted as calling the hypothesis illogical, and Robert Sheaffer criticizes Michael P. Masters&amp;rsquo; work for relying on the belief that time travel is possible. David J. Darling argues that the extraterrestrial and time-travel hypotheses are equally unlikely and unnecessary. Ian Ridpath suggests that Jim Penniston&amp;rsquo;s claims about time-traveling UFOs may have been influenced by the film &lt;em&gt;Official Denial&lt;/em&gt;. Isaac Arthur is mentioned for debunking the concept as presented in &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. Fabio Costa is quoted as saying that time travel requires two doors, one in the future and one in the past, raising the question of where the time machine is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;westall-ufo&#34;&gt;Westall UFO &lt;a href=&#34;#westall-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Westall UFO incident refers to a reported UFO sighting that occurred on April 6, 1966, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The event involved multiple witnesses, including students and a teacher from Westall High School. The incident has been commemorated through documentaries, reunions, and a UFO-themed playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reports&#34;&gt;Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 6, 1966, students and a teacher at Westall High School (now Westall Secondary College) reported observing a round, white, grey, or silver object with a domed top. The object reportedly descended behind trees into the Grange, an open area south of the school. Some accounts mention the object being pursued by five unidentified aircraft. Shaun Matthews, who was on vacation at the Grange, described the object as having a slight purple hue and being about twice the size of a family car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witness accounts varied, with some reporting the object taking off after landing, while others claimed it hovered. Students who went to the Grange after the sighting described a landing site with varying details, including a circle of grass described as burnt, &amp;ldquo;boiled,&amp;rdquo; or pressed down. The number of circles reported ranged from one to three. On April 9, 1966, air force personnel and UFO enthusiasts visited the field but found nothing of interest. The landowner subsequently burned the field to prevent further access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt; newspaper initially suggested the object might have been a weather balloon released from Laverton. However, checks revealed that no commercial, private, or RAAF pilots reported anything unusual in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Basterfield proposed that a runaway balloon from the HIBAL high-altitude balloon project, used to monitor radiation levels after British nuclear tests at Maralinga, could be a likely explanation. He cited documents indicating a test balloon launched from Mildura may have drifted off course and landed near Westall High School. Basterfield noted that HIBAL balloons had a white silver appearance with a parachute and gas tube, consistent with witness descriptions. Reports also surfaced of &amp;ldquo;men in suits&amp;rdquo; cautioning witnesses against discussing the incident, suggesting a secret government exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Dunning suggested that a weather balloon could explain the initial sighting. He proposed that a nylon target drogue, towed by one plane for others to chase, could account for the second part of the event. Dunning also noted that over time, descriptions of the event have become mixed with fabricated details, making it difficult to discern accurate accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media-coverage&#34;&gt;Media Coverage &lt;a href=&#34;#media-coverage&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary &lt;em&gt;Westall &amp;lsquo;66&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the sighting, featuring interviews conducted by ufologist Shane Ryan. &lt;em&gt;Westall &amp;lsquo;66&lt;/em&gt; has been incorporated into the national history curriculum as a lesson on critical analysis of popular portrayals of historical events. &lt;em&gt;The Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary film directed and co-produced by ufologist James Fox, includes content related to the Westall UFO case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;chicago-ohare-ufo-sighting&#34;&gt;Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare UFO Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#chicago-ohare-ufo-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This details a supposed paranormal event that occurred on November 7, 2006, around 4:15 p.m. at O&amp;rsquo;Hare International Airport. Twelve United Airlines employees and other witnesses reported seeing a UFO. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) dismissed the incident as a &amp;ldquo;weather phenomenon&amp;rdquo; due to the object not being detected on radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sighting&#34;&gt;The Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#the-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7, 2006, at approximately 4:15 PM CST, a group of twelve airport employees at Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare International Airport reported witnessing a metallic, saucer-shaped craft hovering over Gate C-17. A ramp employee first spotted the object while pushing back United Airlines Flight 446, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina. The employee alerted the flight crew. Pilots, airline management, and mechanics also witnessed the object. Air traffic controllers did not see the object, and it did not appear on radar. Witnesses described the object as silent, dark gray, and ranging from 6 to 24 feet in diameter. Independent witnesses outside the airport also reported seeing the object. One witness described a disc-shaped craft hovering over the airport that shot through the clouds at high velocity, leaving a clear blue hole. Eyewitness accounts varied regarding the shape, height, movement, time, and number of objects sighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reaction-from-the-federal-aviation-administration-and-united-airlines&#34;&gt;Reaction from the Federal Aviation Administration and United Airlines &lt;a href=&#34;#reaction-from-the-federal-aviation-administration-and-united-airlines&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, both United Airlines and the FAA denied having information about the sighting. The &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, prompting the FAA to conduct an internal review of air-traffic communications tapes. The review uncovered a call from a United supervisor to an FAA manager in the airport tower regarding the UFO sighting. The FAA concluded that the sighting was due to a &amp;ldquo;weather phenomenon&amp;rdquo; and would not investigate further. Astronomer Mark Hammergren suggested that weather conditions were conducive to a &amp;ldquo;hole-punch cloud.&amp;rdquo; UFO investigators argued that the FAA&amp;rsquo;s refusal to investigate contradicted its mandate to investigate potential security breaches at airports. Some witnesses expressed frustration that federal officials declined to investigate the matter further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media-coverage&#34;&gt;Media Coverage &lt;a href=&#34;#media-coverage&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago O&amp;rsquo;Hare airport UFO story received coverage from major media outlets, including CNN, CBS, MSNBC, Fox News, the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, and NPR. The History Channel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;UFO Hunters&lt;/em&gt; reviewed the incident in an episode titled &amp;ldquo;Aliens at the Airport&amp;rdquo; on February 11, 2009. The incident is also featured in &lt;em&gt;Hangar 1: The UFO Files&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial UFO Hypothesis &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-ufo-hypothesis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as spacecraft or probes from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-of-the-term&#34;&gt;Usage of the Term &lt;a href=&#34;#usage-of-the-term&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section traces the use of the term &amp;ldquo;extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in UFO literature. It notes that the term gained traction in the latter half of the 1960s, with early usage attributed to French ufologist Jacques Vallée in his 1966 book. Other figures who used the term in the late 1960s include Aimé Michel, James E. McDonald, and James Harder. Physicist Edward Condon is credited with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &amp;ldquo;ETH&amp;rdquo; in 1969 when presenting the findings of the Condon Report. Skeptic Philip J. Klass also used the term in his 1968 book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chronology&#34;&gt;Chronology &lt;a href=&#34;#chronology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores the historical context leading up to the modern ETH. It traces the origins of the idea of extraterrestrial life and visitation to earlier concepts, including Percival Lowell&amp;rsquo;s theories about Martian canals and ancient Martian civilizations, the science fiction writings of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, who linked other worlds to the afterlife. It also mentions Charles Fort, who collected accounts of anomalous aerial phenomena in the early 20th century and theorized about visitors from other worlds. The modern ETH, linking unidentified aircraft to alien life, took root in the late 1940s and 1950s, influenced by pseudoscience and popular culture, and bolstered by unexplained sightings investigated by governments and civilian groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34;&gt;Historical Reports of Extraterrestrial Visits &lt;a href=&#34;#historical-reports-of-extraterrestrial-visits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents examples of early speculation about extraterrestrial visitors. It mentions a French newspaper story from 1864 about the discovery of an alien-like creature inside an egg-shaped structure. It also discusses H. G. Wells&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;The War of the Worlds&amp;rdquo; (1898), which popularized the idea of Martian visitation and invasion. The section notes a surge in &amp;ldquo;mystery airship&amp;rdquo; reports in the late 19th century, with some speculating about Martian origins. It also mentions the influence of comic strips, radio shows, and movies like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon in popularizing the idea of alien visitation in spaceships. Orson Welles&amp;rsquo; 1938 radio broadcast of &amp;ldquo;The War of the Worlds&amp;rdquo; caused some public panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34;&gt;The 1947 Flying Saucer Wave in America &lt;a href=&#34;#the-1947-flying-saucer-wave-in-america&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the events surrounding the Kenneth Arnold sighting in 1947 and the subsequent &amp;ldquo;flying saucer&amp;rdquo; craze. It details Arnold&amp;rsquo;s initial report of seeing unidentified disk-shaped aircraft near Mount Rainier and his consideration of the possibility of extraterrestrial origins. The section notes the widespread speculation in newspapers about the nature of the &amp;ldquo;saucers,&amp;rdquo; including theories about secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria. It mentions Senator Glen Taylor&amp;rsquo;s comment about wishing the saucers were spaceships from another planet and R. DeWitt Miller&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that they could be vehicles from Mars or other dimensions. The section also cites journalist Edward R. Murrow&amp;rsquo;s observation that the ETH did not gain widespread attention until about 18 months after Arnold&amp;rsquo;s sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-public-opinion&#34;&gt;Evolution of Public Opinion &lt;a href=&#34;#evolution-of-public-opinion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines how public opinion regarding UFOs and the ETH evolved. It mentions the release of the first U.S. poll of public UFO perceptions by Gallup in August 1947, which showed that most people either had no opinion or believed there was a mundane explanation for the sightings. The section also discusses the influence of movies depicting flying saucers and aliens in the early 1950s. It cites a poll published in Popular Science magazine in 1951, which reported that most UFO witnesses believed they had seen a man-made aircraft. By 1957, 25% of Americans were willing to believe in the ETH. A Roper poll in 2002 reported that 56% of respondents thought UFOs were real, with 48% believing that UFOs had visited Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion&#34;&gt;Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section briefly mentions the connection between UFOs and religion, citing the Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, as one of the first and most enduring UFO cults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses NASA&amp;rsquo;s evolving stance on UAPs. In June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, exploring the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP with an agnostic approach, involving experts from various fields to collect data and deduce the identity of such UAP. In August 2021, Kopparapu presented a paper supporting ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-or-government-studies&#34;&gt;Private or Government Studies &lt;a href=&#34;#private-or-government-studies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents examples of private or government studies that have concluded in favor of the ETH or have had members who disagreed with official conclusions. It mentions a 1948 Top Secret USAF Europe document citing Swedish air intelligence&amp;rsquo;s conclusion that some UFOs had extraterrestrial origins. It also discusses the USAF Project Sign&amp;rsquo;s 1948 Top Secret Estimate of the Situation, which concluded that the ETH was the most likely explanation for the most perplexing unexplained cases. The section mentions a secret West German study from 1951 to 1954, headed by Hermann Oberth, which also concluded that UFOs were extraterrestrial. It also discusses the CIA&amp;rsquo;s internal scientific review of UFOs in the early 1950s, noting that some CIA scientists were seriously considering the ETH. The section mentions extraterrestrial &amp;ldquo;believers&amp;rdquo; within Project Blue Book, including Major Dewey Fournet and consultant J. Allen Hynek, who later became a staunch supporter of the ETH. It also cites statements from former CIA Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, who urged Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects. The section mentions Greek physicist Paul Santorini&amp;rsquo;s claim that a 1947 Greek government investigation into the European Ghost rockets concluded that they were extraterrestrial. It also discusses the 1968 Condon Report, noting that many members of the study disagreed with Condon&amp;rsquo;s methods and biases. The section mentions the 1999 private French COMETA report, which concluded that the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors best accounted for the facts. It also discusses Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of the official French UFO investigation SEPRA, who stated that 14% of the cases studied by SEPRA were &amp;lsquo;utterly inexplicable and extraterrestrial&amp;rsquo; in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34;&gt;Critical Responses and Positions of the ETH &lt;a href=&#34;#critical-responses-and-positions-of-the-eth&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents critical responses to the ETH. It notes that there is no scientific proof to back up assertions of alien encounters. It states that despite ardent believers, no rigorous analysis has ever concluded that various UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34;&gt;U.S. Military Investigation and Debunkery &lt;a href=&#34;#us-military-investigation-and-debunkery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the U.S. military&amp;rsquo;s investigation of UFOs and its efforts to debunk the ETH. It mentions the formation of Project Sign in 1947, the first official U.S. military UFO study. It notes that Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation for all UFO reports, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg. The section also discusses the CIA&amp;rsquo;s Robertson Panel, which was organized in 1953 to review the Blue Book&amp;rsquo;s best evidence and recommend an official policy of public debunkery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;involvement-of-scientists&#34;&gt;Involvement of Scientists &lt;a href=&#34;#involvement-of-scientists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section examines the scientific community&amp;rsquo;s response to the ETH. It notes that the scientific community has shown very little support for the ETH, largely accepting the explanation that UFO reports are the result of misinterpretations or hoaxes. It mentions Stephen Hawking&amp;rsquo;s skepticism about the ETH. The section cites Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s observation about the emotional nature of the idea of extraterrestrial visitation and the potential for self-deception. It also quotes Peter A. Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s statement about the narrow polarization of the UFO debate around the ETH. The section presents the results of a 1973 poll of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics members, which found that about 10% believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space. It also presents the results of a 1977 poll of American Astronomical Society members, which asked them to assign probabilities to eight possible explanations for UFOs. The section summarizes the primary scientific arguments against ETH, as outlined by J. Allen Hynek, including the failure of surveillance systems to detect UFOs, gravitational and atmospheric considerations, statistical considerations, the behavior of UFOs and their occupants, the isolation of the UFO phenomenon in time and space, the space unworthiness of UFOs, and the problem of astronomical distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34;&gt;Fewer Sightings Despite Camera Phone Technology &lt;a href=&#34;#fewer-sightings-despite-camera-phone-technology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the argument that the proliferation of smartphone camera technology has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, calling into question the claimed phenomenology of UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nasa-1&#34;&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&#34;#nasa-1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents NASA&amp;rsquo;s official standpoint on the ETH, which is that it lacks empirical evidence. It quotes David Morrison&amp;rsquo;s statements that no one has ever found a single artifact or any other convincing evidence for alien visits and that no claims of UFOs as being alien craft have any validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cia&#34;&gt;CIA &lt;a href=&#34;#cia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section mentions the CIA&amp;rsquo;s organization of the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk the data collected by the Air Force&amp;rsquo;s Project Blue Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-white&#34;&gt;Official White &lt;a href=&#34;#official-white&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section summarizes the book&amp;rsquo;s central argument: that an extraterrestrial craft crashed in New Mexico while observing nuclear weapons activity, and the US government engaged in a cover-up. It highlights accounts of debris described as &amp;ldquo;nothing made on this earth&amp;rdquo; and mentions witnesses like Bill Brazel, Floyd Proctor, and Walt Whitman Jr. The section also notes the book&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the idea that the debris shown in photos with Marcel was substituted as part of the cover-up. It also mentions the claim that the military sought to discredit the growing interest in flying saucers. The section also notes that the authors claimed to have interviewed over 90 witnesses, but only a fraction of those accounts appear in the book. The section also notes that the book elevated Marcel&amp;rsquo;s narrative above that of Cavitt, whose description of the debris contradicted Marcel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alien-bodies&#34;&gt;Alien bodies &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-bodies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the book&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the story about Barney Barnett and archaeology students encountering wreckage and &amp;ldquo;alien bodies&amp;rdquo; on the Plains of San Agustin.

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the reception of the book, noting that critics deemed it &amp;ldquo;a collection of wild hearsay&amp;rdquo; and that it &amp;ldquo;did not make the commercial impact its authors hoped.&amp;rdquo; It also mentions accusations against Moore regarding the Majestic 12 documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;finnish-air-force-ufo-sighting&#34;&gt;Finnish Air Force UFO Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#finnish-air-force-ufo-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finnish Air Force UFO sighting, also known as &amp;ldquo;The seven balloons of Pori,&amp;rdquo; refers to a UFO observation that occurred on April 12, 1969, in Pori, Finland, during military training exercises. This event is notable as the only UFO observation acknowledged by the Finnish Air Force. The Air Force suggested the objects may have been foreign reconnaissance aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sighting&#34;&gt;Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a Fouga Magister jet training mission at Pori Airport on April 12, 1969, a Finnish Defence Forces flight controller instructed pilot-in-training Tarmo Tukeva to investigate seven airborne objects. These objects were floating at an altitude of approximately 1500-3000 meters above the airport. Tukeva described the objects as ball or disc-shaped but could not accurately determine his distance from them. He reported that the objects accelerated away from him &amp;ldquo;at great speed.&amp;rdquo; Radar images, the nature of which remains undetermined, were also reported 200 kilometers away in Vaasa. Jouko Kuronen, another pilot-in-training, stated that he overheard the radio communications between the flight controller and Tukeva and also observed the objects. According to the Finnish Armed Forces magazine &lt;em&gt;Ruotuväki&lt;/em&gt;, the reports from April 12 were similar to other cases occurring over bodies of water during ongoing military exercises, suggesting the possibility of &amp;ldquo;transnational spy planes or aircraft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NASA Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study Team (UAPIST) was a group of experts assembled by NASA to create a plan for analyzing unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;David Spergel, chair of NASA&amp;rsquo;s independent study on UAPs, answers a question during a public meeting of the team on May 31, 2023.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scope-and-objectives&#34;&gt;Scope and objectives &lt;a href=&#34;#scope-and-objectives&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAPIST was officially created by Karen St. Germain, the director of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Earth Science Division, as a subcommittee of the Earth Science Advisory Committee (ESAC) on May 24, 2022. NASA appointed astrophysicist David Spergel as the chair of the team, and Daniel Evans as the official responsible for the study. The team&amp;rsquo;s goal was to gather data from various sources (civilians, government, non-profits, companies) to analyze UAPs. NASA emphasized openness and transparency, stating that findings would be shared publicly. The study was separate from the Department of Defense&amp;rsquo;s UAP efforts, although NASA coordinated with the government. In July 2022, the Department of Defense replaced the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group with the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). Further terms of reference were signed on May 18, 2023, extending the UAPIST and renaming it by changing &amp;ldquo;Aerial&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Anomalous&amp;rdquo;. Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Defense Department&amp;rsquo;s AARO, spoke at the first public meeting on May 31, 2023, emphasizing the complementary nature of NASA and AARO&amp;rsquo;s efforts. NASA focused on unclassified data, while AARO included classified material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uap-versus-ufo-terminology&#34;&gt;UAP versus UFO terminology &lt;a href=&#34;#uap-versus-ufo-terminology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term UAP emerged in the late 1960s, while &amp;ldquo;unidentified flying object&amp;rdquo; (UFO) dates back to 1947. UAP avoids the cultural associations with extraterrestrial life linked to UFOs. UFO has become associated with aliens, conspiracy theories, and religious movements. NASA updated the name of its independent study team at the start of 2023 from &amp;ldquo;unidentified aerial phenomena&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;unidentified anomalous phenomena&amp;rdquo; to be consistent with the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;team-members&#34;&gt;Team members &lt;a href=&#34;#team-members&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA announced the UAP study team members on October 21, 2022. The team included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Spergel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anamaria Berea (George Mason University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federica Bianco (University of Delaware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paula Bontempi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reggie Brothers (AE Industrial Partners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jen Buss (Potomac Institute for Policy Studies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nadia Drake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Gold (Redwire)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Grinspoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Kelly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt Mountain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Randolph (FAA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walter Scott (Maxar Technologies)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Karlin Toner (FAA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shelley Wright (University of California, San Diego)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Eghigian noted that the NASA study team represents a significant shift, with many academics now supporting scholarly research into UFOs. He highlighted that NASA&amp;rsquo;s involvement and the scientifically informed questions being asked are unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first public meeting on May 31, 2023, the NASA team addressed questions about UFOs. They emphasized collecting empirical data and improving UAP analysis. Spergel noted that many UAP events could be attributed to commercial aircraft, drones, balloons, weather, and ionospheric phenomena, but some events remain unexplained due to poor data quality. He cited fast radio bursts as an example of how anomalies can lead to novel physical phenomena. Regarding David Grusch&amp;rsquo;s claims of a government coverup, Joshua Semeter stated that the NASA team is collaborating with the Defense Department&amp;rsquo;s AARO to determine the origin and nature of UAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-report&#34;&gt;Final report &lt;a href=&#34;#final-report&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent study team&amp;rsquo;s final report was published on September 14, 2023, along with the announcement of a director of UAP research at NASA. The report found no evidence of extraterrestrial life. The report stated that the lack of reproducible data makes it difficult to draw conclusions about some UAP origins. It recommended a rigorous, evidence-based approach to studying UAPs, including data collection methods using artificial intelligence and citizen observers. NASA was deemed well-positioned to lead this study. According to its 2023 terms of reference, the team was dissolved upon the completion and submission of its final report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the alleged Trinity UFO case, a story about a crashed unidentified object near the Trinity test site in New Mexico in August 1945. The narrative centers around claims made by José Padilla and Remigio Baca, who, as young boys, reported witnessing the crash and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Trinity UFO case by referencing the broader history of UFO conspiracy theories. It mentions the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting, the 1947 flying disc craze, the Roswell incident, and the Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax. It also introduces Jacques Vallée, a ufologist and author who publicized the Trinity case, noting his involvement in the film &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-context&#34;&gt;The Context &lt;a href=&#34;#the-context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the setting of the alleged incident, focusing on the Padilla family&amp;rsquo;s ranch near the Trinity test site. It details the family&amp;rsquo;s lifestyle, including Faustino Padilla&amp;rsquo;s work and José&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities on the ranch. It also mentions the impact of the Trinity test on the local population, including Inez Padilla&amp;rsquo;s loss of eyesight. The section touches on the backgrounds of both the Padilla and Baca families, noting their Spanish and Apache heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;claims-by-padilla-and-baca&#34;&gt;Claims by Padilla and Baca &lt;a href=&#34;#claims-by-padilla-and-baca&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the specific claims made by José Padilla and Remigio Baca regarding their alleged encounter with a crashed UFO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the initial sighting of the crashed object by Padilla and Baca on August 16, 1945. It describes their search for a lost cow, the loud bang they heard, and their discovery of a groove in the ground leading to an &amp;ldquo;avocado-shaped&amp;rdquo; object. They report seeing small, insect-like creatures near the object, which they compared to a praying mantis, Jerusalem cricket, and fire ant. The boys estimated the object&amp;rsquo;s size and described its metallic appearance, as well as the appearance of the creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-day&#34;&gt;Third day &lt;a href=&#34;#third-day&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection recounts the boys&amp;rsquo; return to the crash site with José Padilla&amp;rsquo;s father, Faustino Padilla, and Eddie Apodaca, a state police officer. It states that the adults entered the object but were visibly disturbed afterward, warning the boys to remain silent. The boys later returned alone and witnessed soldiers collecting debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fourth-day&#34;&gt;Fourth day &lt;a href=&#34;#fourth-day&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection describes a visit to the Padilla family by Sergeant R. Avila, who requested permission to access the property to recover an &amp;ldquo;experimental weather balloon.&amp;rdquo; Avila emphasized the need for secrecy and the use of heavy equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-fifth-and-the-following-days&#34;&gt;The fifth and the following days &lt;a href=&#34;#the-fifth-and-the-following-days&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subsection details the alleged military operation to recover the crashed object. It describes the construction of a road and gate, the arrival of a lowboy trailer, and the use of a crane to lift the object. Padilla and Baca claim to have secretly observed the military&amp;rsquo;s activities. They also describe how they obtained a &amp;ldquo;souvenir&amp;rdquo; from inside the object, a metal piece they named &amp;ldquo;Tesoro.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-the-recovery&#34;&gt;After the recovery &lt;a href=&#34;#after-the-recovery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the aftermath of the alleged recovery operation. It mentions the removal of the object, the clearing of the crash site, and the hiding of the &amp;ldquo;Tesoro&amp;rdquo; by the boys. It also touches on the atmosphere of secrecy and fear in the area, with rumors of government intervention for those who spoke too much about the events. Vallée draws parallels between this case and the Roswell incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publication&#34;&gt;Publication &lt;a href=&#34;#publication&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Flight 105 UFO sighting</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_f9095ed38662/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_f9095ed38662/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;flight-105-ufo-sighting&#34;&gt;Flight 105 UFO Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#flight-105-ufo-sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the UFO sighting reported by the crew of United Airlines Flight 105 on July 4, 1947, over the Pacific Northwest. It connects the event to the broader context of the 1947 flying disc craze and provides background information, a description of the sighting, its aftermath, and eventual explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section provides context for the Flight 105 incident by referencing the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting and the broader 1947 flying disc craze. It explains how Arnold&amp;rsquo;s report of objects flying near Mount Rainier led to the terms &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flying discs&amp;rdquo; and sparked a wave of similar reports. The section establishes the Flight 105 sighting as part of this larger phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sighting&#34;&gt;Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the details of the Flight 105 UFO sighting. On July 4, 1947, United Airlines Flight 105, a Douglas DC-3, departed from Boise, Idaho, bound for Pendleton, Oregon. First Officer Ralph Stevens spotted unusual objects and alerted Captain E.J. Smith. Both men, along with stewardess Marty Morrow, observed four to five &amp;ldquo;flat and circular&amp;rdquo; objects. The objects were larger than aircraft and flew in formation for approximately 10 to 15 minutes (about 45 miles). The crew radioed the tower in Ontario, Oregon, and another United flight, but neither could confirm the sighting. The passengers did not see the objects. The objects eventually sped away or disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the immediate reactions and consequences of the Flight 105 sighting. News outlets widely reported the crew&amp;rsquo;s account. The report was considered credible due to the professional background of the witnesses. Captain Smith, Ralph Stevens, and Kenneth Arnold were photographed together &amp;ldquo;comparing notes.&amp;rdquo; Kenneth Arnold felt vindicated by the corroboration of his own sighting. Arnold and Smith were interviewed by the FBI and investigated the Maury Island hoax together. Another &amp;ldquo;disklike object&amp;rdquo; was sighted on Flight 105 later in July by a different pair of pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanation-and-legacy&#34;&gt;Explanation and Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#explanation-and-legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explains the official explanation for the Flight 105 sighting and its lasting impact. Air Materiel Command concluded that the objects were likely &amp;ldquo;ordinary aircraft, balloons, birds, or pure illusion&amp;rdquo; due to the sighting occurring at sunset. The Air Force suggested the power of suggestion influenced observers during the craze. Despite the official explanation, the Flight 105 sighting has become part of UFO folklore and conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1994-sighting-in-zimbabwe&#34;&gt;1994 Sighting in Zimbabwe &lt;a href=&#34;#1994-sighting-in-zimbabwe&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 16, 1994, a UFO sighting occurred outside Ruwa, Zimbabwe, witnessed by 62 pupils aged six to twelve at Ariel School. The children reported seeing silver crafts descend from the sky and land in a nearby field. Some claimed to have encountered creatures dressed in black who communicated a telepathic message with an environmental theme, causing fear and distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortean writer Jerome Clark called it the &amp;ldquo;most remarkable close encounter of the third kind of the 1990s.&amp;rdquo; Skeptics have suggested mass hysteria as a possible explanation. Some children maintain the truthfulness of their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruwa is described as a small agricultural center 22 kilometers southeast of Harare. Ariel School was a private school, primarily attended by children from wealthy white families in Harare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days before the Ariel School incident, numerous UFO sightings were reported throughout southern Africa, including reports of a bright fireball in the sky at night. This led to a wave of UFO mania in Zimbabwe. Brian Dunning suggests the fireball was the re-entry of the Zenit-2 rocket from the Cosmos 2290 satellite launch. Local UFO researcher Cynthia Hind recorded other alien sightings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sightings at Ariel School occurred at 10 a.m. on September 16, 1994, during mid-morning break. The faculty was in a meeting at the time. The incident lasted about fifteen minutes. The children reported the event to their teachers, but were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After telling their parents, many parents came to the school the next day to discuss the incident with the faculty. The sighting was reported on ZBC Radio, where Cynthia Hind learned about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBC correspondent Tim Leach visited the school on September 19 to film interviews with pupils and staff. Hind visited the school on September 20, interviewing children and asking them to draw what they had seen. She reported that the children told her the same story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Harvard University professor of psychiatry John Mack visited the school to interview witnesses. Mack had investigated UFO sightings and the alien abduction phenomenon throughout the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to interviews by Hind, Leach, and Mack, 62 children reported seeing at least one UFO. Silver objects, usually described as discs, appeared in the sky and descended to a field near the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between one and four creatures with big eyes and dressed in black exited a craft and approached the children. Some children ran, but others stayed and watched. Mack&amp;rsquo;s interviews suggest the creatures telepathically communicated an environmental message to the children before returning to the craft and flying away. Dunning notes that the telepathic message aspect was primarily in Mack&amp;rsquo;s reports, although Hind reported it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children described being warned about impending events and the importance of avoiding pollution. One child said they were told the world would end because of a lack of care for the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children insisted they had not seen a plane. Hind noted that the children&amp;rsquo;s different cultural backgrounds led to varying interpretations, with some believing they had seen tikoloshes from Shona and Ndebele folklore rather than extraterrestrials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ariel School UFO incident became a famous UFO case in Africa. A June 2021 episode of the BBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Witness History&lt;/em&gt; described it as &amp;ldquo;one of the most significant events in UFO history.&amp;rdquo; Ufologists continue to cite the case as evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth. Skeptics have suggested mass hysteria or a prank as explanations. Gideon Reid proposed a hypothesis involving confusion with touring puppet shows promoting AIDS awareness. Another argument suggests the children misidentified a dust devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hind interviewed the children in groups, potentially leading to cross-contamination of their stories. Dunning says that Mack, interviewed the children two months after the alleged sighting and as a known environmentalist, &amp;ldquo;prompted and suggested&amp;rdquo; the telepathic communication angle, which was not present in Hind&amp;rsquo;s previous report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several witnesses maintain the truthfulness of their accounts. In 2014, a witness told the &lt;em&gt;Mail &amp;amp; Guardian&lt;/em&gt; that she fears the creatures will return and that she can sense when they are back in the atmosphere. In 2016, witness Emily Trim exhibited paintings described as a &amp;ldquo;manifestation of the messages she received&amp;rdquo; from the beings. In June 2021, Barstool Sports writer Zah, a former Ariel School pupil, recounted seeing a bright light and aliens exiting it. Other witnesses were interviewed for the 2020 documentary &lt;em&gt;The Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Netflix documentary &amp;ldquo;Encounters&amp;rdquo;, a former student named Dallyn claimed that he was behind this incident. He claimed that he purposefully told his classmates and other students that a &amp;ldquo;shiny rock&amp;rdquo; in the distance was a UFO. According to his own statement in the documentary, he never thought this would work, and was surprised about the mass hysteria. Dallyn&amp;rsquo;s claims in the documentary directly contradict claims made on camera 15 years prior to the documentary, describing the UFO as having a light that would &amp;ldquo;flash a different color in the sky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;trident-a-proposed-mission-to-neptune-and-triton&#34;&gt;Trident: A Proposed Mission to Neptune and Triton &lt;a href=&#34;#trident-a-proposed-mission-to-neptune-and-triton&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the &lt;em&gt;Trident&lt;/em&gt; mission, a proposed NASA space probe designed to study Neptune and its moon Triton. It outlines the mission&amp;rsquo;s objectives, timeline, scientific payload, and its selection process within NASA&amp;rsquo;s Discovery Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mission-overview&#34;&gt;Mission Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trident&lt;/em&gt; was a proposed reconnaissance mission to the outer solar system, specifically targeting Neptune and its moon Triton. The mission aimed to capitalize on a rare 13-year alignment of Jupiter and Neptune to enable efficient gravity assists. The primary goal was to study Triton, building upon the limited data obtained during Voyager 2&amp;rsquo;s flyby in 1989. The mission was proposed to NASA&amp;rsquo;s Discovery Program in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section recounts the context for the &lt;em&gt;Trident&lt;/em&gt; mission, emphasizing the importance of Triton as a geologically active moon with cryovolcanoes and a thin atmosphere. It highlights that Voyager 2 only observed about 40% of Triton&amp;rsquo;s surface. The &lt;em&gt;Trident&lt;/em&gt; mission concept emerged from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Ocean Worlds Exploration Program to address unanswered questions from the Voyager 2 flyby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the mission&amp;rsquo;s scientific objectives and planned trajectory. &lt;em&gt;Trident&lt;/em&gt; aimed to take advantage of a favorable gravity assist alignment between Jupiter and Neptune, which occurs once every 13 years. This alignment would allow the spacecraft to reach Neptune and Triton in 2038. The mission would map Triton&amp;rsquo;s surface, analyze its plume activity, and assess the potential existence of an internal ocean. The principal investigator for the &lt;em&gt;Trident&lt;/em&gt; mission was Louise Prockter, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. The proposed launch vehicle was the Atlas V 401, potentially replaced by the Vulcan rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;payload&#34;&gt;Payload &lt;a href=&#34;#payload&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists the scientific instruments that &lt;em&gt;Trident&lt;/em&gt; would carry to study Neptune and Triton. The payload includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An infrared spectrometer for compositional mapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrow and wide-angle cameras for high-resolution imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A triaxial magnetometer for ocean detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio science equipment for atmospheric and gravimetry observations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A plasma spectrometer for analyzing atmospheric charged particles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruments have heritage from previous missions like &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MESSENGER&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;JUICE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;shag-harbour-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Shag Harbour UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#shag-harbour-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shag Harbour UFO incident refers to the reported crash of a large, unidentified object into the waters near Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, on October 4, 1967. The incident was investigated by Canadian civilian and military agencies, as well as the U.S. Condon Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-incident-aerial-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Pre-incident Aerial Phenomenon &lt;a href=&#34;#pre-incident-aerial-phenomenon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details several aerial phenomena reported before the Shag Harbour incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;air-canada-flight-305&#34;&gt;Air Canada flight 305 &lt;a href=&#34;#air-canada-flight-305&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Canada Flight 305, en route from Halifax to Toronto, experienced a sighting. First Officer Robert Ralph pointed out a strange object to Captain Pierre Charbonneau. The object was described as a brilliantly lit, rectangular shape with trailing lights, flying parallel to the aircraft. The pilots reported two silent explosions near the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yellow-object&#34;&gt;Yellow object &lt;a href=&#34;#yellow-object&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darrel Dorey, along with his sister Kaykay and mother, witnessed a large object maneuvering in the southwestern horizon from their porch in Mahone Bay. Dorey wrote to the RCAF Greenwood Base Commander to inquire about the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mv-nickerson-of-sambro-nova-scotia&#34;&gt;MV &lt;em&gt;Nickerson&lt;/em&gt; of Sambro, Nova Scotia &lt;a href=&#34;#mv-nickerson-of-sambro-nova-scotia&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Leo Howard Mersey of the MV &lt;em&gt;Nickerson&lt;/em&gt; observed four bright objects in a rectangular formation on his Decca radar and visually in the northeastern sky, approximately 28 kilometers from his vessel. The entire crew of nearly twenty fishermen witnessed the event. Mersey reported the sighting to the rescue coordination center and the harbor master in Halifax, and later filed a report with the Lunenburg RCMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;halifax-harbour-sightings&#34;&gt;Halifax Harbour sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#halifax-harbour-sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Chronicle-Herald&lt;/em&gt; and local radio stations reported numerous sightings of a glowing object around Halifax at approximately 10:00 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-events&#34;&gt;Initial events &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-events&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 4, 1967, at approximately 11:20 pm Atlantic Daylight Time, reports surfaced of an object crashing into the waters of Shag Harbour. At least eleven witnesses observed a low-flying, lit object heading towards the harbor, accompanied by whistling and whooshing sounds, followed by a loud bang. Laurie Wickens and four friends, driving on Highway 3, witnessed a large object descending into the water. They observed the object floating offshore and contacted the RCMP detachment in Barrington Passage, reporting a possible plane or airliner crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search-and-rescue-efforts&#34;&gt;Search and rescue efforts &lt;a href=&#34;#search-and-rescue-efforts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the initial report, two RCMP officers arrived at the scene. The RCMP contacted the Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) in Halifax to report the incident and inquire about missing aircraft. The object, still displaying lights, began to sink and disappeared from view before any rescue attempt could be initiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rescue mission was assembled, with local fishing boats and a Canadian Coast Guard cutter dispatched to the crash site. No survivors, bodies, or debris were recovered. The next morning, RCC Halifax confirmed that no aircraft were missing. Despite this, the search continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCC Halifax sent a telex to the &amp;ldquo;Air Desk&amp;rdquo; at air force headquarters in Ottawa, classifying the incident as a &amp;ldquo;UFO Report.&amp;rdquo; The Air Desk then sent a telex to navy headquarters, recommending an underwater search. Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic was tasked with carrying out the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days after the incident, navy divers from Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic searched the seafloor off Shag Harbour for three days. The final report indicated that no trace of an object was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;documents&#34;&gt;Documents &lt;a href=&#34;#documents&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of National Defence files at the national Library and Archives contain a summary of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;press-coverage&#34;&gt;Press coverage &lt;a href=&#34;#press-coverage&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shag Harbour incident received extensive coverage in the &lt;em&gt;Halifax Chronicle-Herald&lt;/em&gt;. A headline story on October 7, titled &amp;ldquo;Could Be Something Concrete in Shag Harbour UFO – RCAF,&amp;rdquo; detailed witness accounts, the air force&amp;rsquo;s search and rescue efforts, and the navy&amp;rsquo;s underwater search. Squadron Leader Bain, head of the air force&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Air Desk,&amp;rdquo; expressed the air force&amp;rsquo;s strong interest in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another article on October 9, titled &amp;ldquo;UFO Search Called Off,&amp;rdquo; reported the navy&amp;rsquo;s conclusion of the underwater search, stating that no trace of the object was found. The Canadian Press also carried the story of the search being called off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1967 British flying saucer hoax</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_ca77cd9256e0/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 21:07:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1967-british-flying-saucer-hoax&#34;&gt;1967 British Flying Saucer Hoax &lt;a href=&#34;#1967-british-flying-saucer-hoax&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1967 British flying saucer hoax involved the supposed landing of six &amp;lsquo;spaceships&amp;rsquo; across Southern England on September 4, 1967. These &amp;lsquo;spacecraft&amp;rsquo; prompted a significant response from the police and army. The objects were described as being 54 inches long, 30 inches wide, and 20 inches deep, weighing 100 pounds, and emitting an electronic noise. The six craft were located along the 51st line of latitude, stretching from the Thames Estuary to the Bristol Channel. Specific locations included Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, Bromley golf course in south London, Winkfield village near Ascot, Welford near Newbury, Chippenham in Wiltshire, and Dial Hill in Clevedon, Somerset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning-and-building-the-spacecraft&#34;&gt;Planning and Building the &amp;lsquo;Spacecraft&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#planning-and-building-the-spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hoax was conceived in January 1967 by aircraft engineering apprentices from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough as part of Rag Week. The apprentices constructed the flying saucers from fiberglass halves, covered them in metal, and equipped them with electronic devices to produce eerie sounds when flipped. Each saucer also contained a mixture of flour and water. Teams of two or three transported the saucers to the chosen locations at night, flipped them over to activate the sound, and then left the scene undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;response-from-the-authorities&#34;&gt;Response from the Authorities &lt;a href=&#34;#response-from-the-authorities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the saucers triggered a large-scale response from authorities. Police cordoned off each site, and the British army&amp;rsquo;s southern command, multiple police forces, army bomb disposal units, and RAF helicopters were mobilized. The Ministry of Defence was notified. The army detonated the saucer found in Chippenham, while the one on the Isle of Sheppey was removed by helicopter. Other saucers were sent to the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and the British Aircraft Corporation&amp;rsquo;s guided weapons division. When one of the saucers was drilled into, the mixture inside exploded, covering police officers in foul-smelling slime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Southall and Roger Palmer, both 21 years old, were identified as the pranksters behind the hoax. Their motive was to raise funds during Rag Week. The hoax generated extensive media coverage both in Britain and internationally. The apprentices revealed the hoax on the same day the saucers were found. No legal action was taken against them, and they successfully raised £2,000 for charity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gulf Breeze UFO incident</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_9ca961617b2c/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;gulf-breeze-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Gulf Breeze UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#gulf-breeze-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Breeze UFO incident refers to a series of claimed UFO sightings that occurred in Gulf Breeze, Florida, between November 1987 and May 1988. The events gained widespread attention after the &lt;em&gt;Gulf Breeze Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; newspaper published photographs purportedly showing a UFO, provided by local contractor Ed Walters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;events-of-november-11-1987--may-1-1988&#34;&gt;Events of November 11, 1987 – May 1, 1988 &lt;a href=&#34;#events-of-november-11-1987--may-1-1988&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Walters claimed to have been immobilized by a blue beam on November 11, 1987, after which he took photos of a UFO hovering near his home. He reported multiple subsequent encounters, taking more photos and even videotaping the object. Walters also claimed to have witnessed the craft landing and aliens exiting, communicating with him telepathically in English and Spanish, and even being lifted off the ground by a blue beam. He reported a total of nineteen sightings or encounters. On one occasion, he claimed the UFO leaked a liquid that continued to boil for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigation&#34;&gt;Investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters initially provided his photographs to the &lt;em&gt;Gulf Breeze Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; anonymously. He later admitted to being the photographer and submitted to a polygraph test, which indicated he believed his photos were real. Walters also claimed to have experienced missing time on three prior occasions and under hypnosis, stated he had been abducted by aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several individuals investigated the claims. Ray Stanford initially questioned the weather data related to the photos but later conceded they were likely taken on the reported day. Phillip Klass dismissed the photos as inauthentic. Robert Nathan from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggested the images were double exposures or manipulated. Ed Gray, the mayor of Gulf Breeze, also concluded the photos were fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budd Hopkins believed Walters&amp;rsquo; claims were genuine, citing his polygraph test and refusal of a book deal. Bruce Maccabee found a good chance the photos were real. Willy Smith from UNICAT suggested a support under the UFO in the photos indicated it was a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eglin Air Force Base, located near Gulf Breeze, reported no unusual activity or radar blips during the alleged sightings. Gulf Breeze&amp;rsquo;s police chief, Jerry Brown, attributed the sightings to hysteria and misidentification of activity at the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;eyewitness-reports&#34;&gt;Eyewitness Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#eyewitness-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of Walters&amp;rsquo; photos, numerous other residents reported sightings in the Gulf Breeze area. These reports described orange glows, beams of light, and oval or oblong crafts. Fenner McConnell and his wife Shirley claimed to have seen a disc-shaped aircraft with no wings. Brenda Pollak, a Gulf Breeze councilwoman, reported seeing an orange light and witnessed Walters taking photos of a UFO at Shoreline Park. Santa Rosa County Commissioner John Broxson also claimed to have seen unusual lights. Other residents, like Art and Mary Hufford, and Jeff Thompson, reported seeing similar objects. A tollbooth operator, Jerry Thompson, reported seeing thirteen pink-lighted objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo-research-group-response&#34;&gt;UFO Research Group Response &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-research-group-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Walters, particularly within MUFON, viewed the mass sightings as evidence of the phenomena&amp;rsquo;s authenticity. MUFON&amp;rsquo;s director, Walter Andrus, considered the Gulf Breeze incident their &amp;ldquo;best case ever.&amp;rdquo; Donald Ware, MUFON&amp;rsquo;s Florida director, believed the aliens wanted the photos to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUFOS, founded by J. Allen Hynek, deemed Walters&amp;rsquo; photos fake due to inconsistencies in the craft&amp;rsquo;s windows and waviness suggesting reflection off water. Friends of Walters reportedly described him as a prankster who had planned &amp;ldquo;the ultimate prank&amp;rdquo; and noted parallels between his story and Whitley Streiber&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-discovered&#34;&gt;Model Discovered &lt;a href=&#34;#model-discovered&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, a model resembling the UFO in Walters&amp;rsquo; photos was found in the attic of his former home. The model was made of foam plates and drafting paper. Craig Myers of the &lt;em&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported the discovery and was able to duplicate Walters&amp;rsquo; photos using the model. Walters denied any knowledge of the model, claiming it was planted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the model caused division within the UFO community. Supporters claimed it was planted, while others expressed doubt in Walters&amp;rsquo; claims. It was also revealed that Walters had received a $200,000 book advance and was offered $450,000 for miniseries rights. Additionally, he had a prior criminal record for forgery and auto theft, for which he received a pardon from Governor Bob Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;renewed-interest-after-1990&#34;&gt;Renewed Interest After 1990 &lt;a href=&#34;#renewed-interest-after-1990&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO sightings continued at the Pensacola Bay Bridge into 1991. In 1993, a friend of the Walters family admitted to witnessing Ed faking the UFO pictures. Mark Curtis also reported that Walter and his wife had divorced in November 1992, splitting $2.5 million in assets believed to have come from the hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUFON held its first annual UFO symposium in Pensacola in 1990, which continued for the rest of the decade. The publicity attracted tourists and UFO sightseers, boosting the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-media&#34;&gt;In the Media &lt;a href=&#34;#in-the-media&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Breeze UFO case was featured on &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt; and a TV special called &amp;ldquo;UFO Cover-UP&amp;hellip;Live!&amp;rdquo;. Eyewitness Shirley McConnell discussed her experience on &lt;em&gt;A Current Affair&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;A Current Affair&lt;/em&gt; filmed more UFO shows in July 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1994 episode of &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, Fox Mulder mentions the Gulf Breeze UFO photos, stating he knew they were fakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulf Breeze singer Ken Manning won an award for his song &amp;ldquo;Gulf Breeze UFO&amp;rdquo; in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ground Crew Project</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_8085248acddf/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 22:59:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ground-crew-project&#34;&gt;Ground Crew Project &lt;a href=&#34;#ground-crew-project&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ground Crew Project is a UFO religion originating in the United States, founded in the 1980s by Sheldan Nidle. It transitioned online in 1996 and later divided into the &amp;ldquo;Ground Crew&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Planetary Activation Organisation.&amp;rdquo; The group anticipates a cosmic transformation of Earth, facilitated by a passage through a &amp;lsquo;photon belt&amp;rsquo; and aided by the &amp;ldquo;Galactic Federation.&amp;rdquo; Members prepare for first contact, envisioning themselves as intermediaries between extraterrestrials and humanity. Despite failed predictions, the group maintains its belief in imminent contact and the need to elevate mankind&amp;rsquo;s consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sheldan-nidle&#34;&gt;Sheldan Nidle &lt;a href=&#34;#sheldan-nidle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheldan Nidle, born in 1946, claims to have had extraterrestrial encounters from a young age, including telepathic communication and learning aboard spacecraft with ETs from Sirius. He published &lt;em&gt;You’re Becoming a Galactic Human&lt;/em&gt; in 1994, detailing a childhood encounter. He claims regular communication with ETs since 1955, which he ceased at age 14 to fulfill his &amp;lsquo;star seed&amp;rsquo; mission. He later became involved with the Amateur Astronomers Club and a film about Nikola Tesla. Nidle holds advanced degrees from Ohio University and the University of Southern California. In the mid-1980s, he resumed contact with the &amp;ldquo;Galactic Federation&amp;rdquo; and became a lecturer representing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;galactic-federation&#34;&gt;Galactic Federation &lt;a href=&#34;#galactic-federation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Galactic Federation is described as an alliance of extraterrestrial civilizations within the Milky Way galaxy. This concept is popular in UFO religions and New Age movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;haim-esheds-claims&#34;&gt;Haim Eshed&amp;rsquo;s claims &lt;a href=&#34;#haim-esheds-claims&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Haim Eshed, former head of Israel&amp;rsquo;s military space program, claimed that aliens have contacted representatives of the United States and Israel, but humanity is not ready for contact. He stated that aliens are present on Earth and have formed a &amp;ldquo;Galactic Federation&amp;rdquo; to avoid mass hysteria until humanity is ready. NASA responded by stating that no extraterrestrial life has been found, but the search continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;photon-belt&#34;&gt;Photon Belt &lt;a href=&#34;#photon-belt&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1996, Nidle channeled messages about an imminent apocalypse due to Earth&amp;rsquo;s planetary transformation. He claimed to lead a mission for the &amp;ldquo;Galactic Federation of Planets&amp;rdquo; to prepare the world for this transformation as the planet passes into a cosmic &amp;lsquo;photon belt&amp;rsquo;. This area of space supposedly has high energy properties that would transform Earth into a pristine state and restore superhuman abilities by altering human DNA to a 12-helix pattern. The pineal gland would be activated, and humans would regain cosmic abilities like rejuvenation, telepathy, and overcoming illness. The channeling claimed that human structures would be destroyed, and the only safe places would be underground or in spaceships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;imminent-landing&#34;&gt;Imminent Landing &lt;a href=&#34;#imminent-landing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative stated that a mass landing of 15 million starships of the &amp;ldquo;Galactic Federation&amp;rdquo; would occur no later than December 17, 1996, to raise humanity&amp;rsquo;s consciousness using advanced technology, achieving a galactic and divine society by 2012. The landing would involve advanced races like Pleiadians, Sirians, Cassopeans, and Arcturians, who would meet and placate human populations. Earthly weapons would be neutralized, mechanical devices shut down, and world government taken over by the Spiritual Hierarchy. The Earth transformation would include telepathy, airborne transport, and photon energy generators. This is considered a &amp;ldquo;cargoistic&amp;rdquo; belief, where alien &amp;ldquo;cargo&amp;rdquo; brings about human ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ground-crew&#34;&gt;Ground Crew &lt;a href=&#34;#ground-crew&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Ground Crew&amp;rdquo; refers to the virtual congregation who join the mission. Members were told they would assist humanity and the extraterrestrials as councillors and ambassadors. They would be trained by space forces and receive implants. After failed predictions, the emphasis shifted to spiritual development, requiring the Ground Crew to help raise humanity spiritually and assist in ecological restoration. This involved gathering humanity through world meditation days to harmonize vibrations and creating a &amp;rsquo;network of light&amp;rsquo; with other new age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;landings-delayed&#34;&gt;Landings delayed &lt;a href=&#34;#landings-delayed&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The December 1996 mass landing did not occur, but Nidle continued to spread messages that spaceships would appear soon. Further dates, including the Gregorian New Year and spring of 1997, also passed without a landing. Delays were attributed to a solar storm and planetary instability. Details about the comet Hale-Bopp were communicated, and the number of spaceships in the landing fleet was increased to 25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hale-bopp&#34;&gt;Hale-Bopp &lt;a href=&#34;#hale-bopp&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new landing date was set to coincide with the arrival of the Hale-Bopp comet on May 5, 1997. The comet was described as a large spaceship with cloaking and holographic systems, containing a crew of over 200,000 beings and 10,000 ambassadors. This would coincide with the mass landing by the Federation. After the mass suicide of Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate members, the Ground Crew distanced themselves from such acts. Instead of a mass landing, a meeting between a shuttle from the comet and a shuttle from the &amp;ldquo;Galactic Federation Fleet&amp;rdquo; took place near Ayers Rock in Australia, where a ceremony was conducted, and papers were exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-re-scheduling-and-shift-in-focus&#34;&gt;Further re-scheduling and shift in focus &lt;a href=&#34;#further-re-scheduling-and-shift-in-focus&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nidle and the Ground Crew blamed repeated failed prophecies on external factors, such as dark forces conspiring with &amp;lsquo;planetary elites&amp;rsquo;. Messages began to deny the relevance of specific arrival dates and talked about &amp;ldquo;the right divine time.&amp;rdquo; The focus shifted to humans assisting in the planet&amp;rsquo;s transformation before galactic intervention. Salvation became a two-way street, determined by human attitudes. A more spiritual content appeared, referring to beings like Ashtar Sheran, Aaron Alaje, Megha Alcorn, Merku Alcorn, Great White Brotherhood, Ascended Masters, and archangels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;split&#34;&gt;Split &lt;a href=&#34;#split&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 1997, Nidle split with Valerie Donnell, his secretary and the Ground Crew&amp;rsquo;s chief administrator. Donnell retained the Ground Crew name and website, posting channeled messages with a UFO content focused on personal spiritual transformation from a new age perspective. Nidle founded the Planetary Activation Organisation, restructuring it as the only source for messages about the Galactic Federation. He established a hierarchical system and created a &amp;ldquo;Web of Light&amp;rdquo; to unite like-minded groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-the-narrative&#34;&gt;Evolution of the narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#evolution-of-the-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Nidle&amp;rsquo;s channeling, the Federation remained dedicated to first contact, but the spiritual transformation of humans became the main focus. Earth rulers were identified as a secret cabal, but would be removed by the Federation. &amp;lsquo;Star Gates&amp;rsquo; were being placed in the upper atmosphere, and &amp;lsquo;Galactic and Medical Teams&amp;rsquo; were assisting people during sleep. Earth was portrayed as a vitally important planet due to humanity&amp;rsquo;s exalted role, acting as a switch in the spiritual transformation of the Milky Way. By 2000, the movement continued to develop its membership base, claiming hundreds of Planetary Activation Groups in over 29 countries. The Planetary Activation Organisation is classified as a progressive millennialist group promising collective salvation and a terrestrial paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credibility&#34;&gt;Credibility &lt;a href=&#34;#credibility&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ground Crew employed strategies to avoid prophetic disconfirmation and cognitive dissonance, such as disclaimers and exploiting temporality. Nidle reconceptualized the movement through spiritualization, changing the focus from a UFO landing to the need for humans to raise their own spirituality. Due to the virtual nature of the group, it is impossible to accurately account for membership. The movement&amp;rsquo;s period of failed prophecy is no longer online. The online narrative functions like fiction, conveying a vivid imaginary world and apocalyptic expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the Canary Islands. The article has been flagged for needing additional citations, requiring cleanup, and having multiple issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section lists specific dates of reported UFO sightings in the Canary Islands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1974 – 24 November:&lt;/strong&gt; A sighting is recorded on this date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1976 – 22 June:&lt;/strong&gt; This sighting is notable due to its duration (over 40 minutes), multiple locations (Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera, Gran Canaria, and a ship at sea), and numerous witnesses (hundreds of people, including civilians and military personnel). Two witnesses reported seeing occupants inside the craft, but this account is considered dubious by Antonio Munaiz, a military judge who wrote the Spanish government report, and Carlos Dolz de Espejo, the lieutenant general of the Air Force at the time. The official report by the Spanish Air Force was declassified in June 1994, with much of its content released earlier in 1977 by journalist and paranormal investigator J.J. Benitez, who used it for a book on UFO cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1976 – 19 November:&lt;/strong&gt; Another sighting is noted on this date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1979 – 5 March:&lt;/strong&gt; A final sighting is listed for this date.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a description of the 1988 science fiction film &lt;em&gt;Alien from L.A.&lt;/em&gt; directed by Albert Pyun, based on the provided Wikipedia article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien from L.A.&lt;/em&gt; is a 1988 science fiction film directed by Albert Pyun, starring Kathy Ireland. The film centers on a young woman from Los Angeles who discovers an underground civilization in Atlantis. The film is loosely based on Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Center of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;. It was also featured on &lt;em&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanda Saknussemm, a social misfit from Los Angeles, learns of her archaeologist father&amp;rsquo;s death in North Africa. While sorting through his belongings, she discovers notes about Atlantis, an alien ship that crashed and sank into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s center. Wanda accidentally falls into a deep hole and awakens in the underground world of Atlantis. She encounters Gus, a miner, who helps her search for her father, whom she believes is still alive. The Atlanteans consider surface dwellers &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; and suspect Wanda and her father of planning an invasion. Wanda becomes a fugitive, pursued by &amp;ldquo;Government House&amp;rdquo; and the crime lord Mambino. She receives assistance from Charmin&amp;rsquo;, a rogue who falls in love with her. Eventually, Wanda is captured by General Rykov, who intends to kill her and her father. Gus helps them escape, and they return to the surface. The film concludes with Wanda rejecting her ex-boyfriend and reuniting with Charmin&amp;rsquo; on a beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Pyun took on &lt;em&gt;Alien from L.A.&lt;/em&gt; after being approached by producers Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan during the troubled production of &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Center of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;. Pyun agreed to finish the film if he could also film &lt;em&gt;Alien from L.A.&lt;/em&gt; for under $1 million. Kathy Ireland was cast by Pyun after seeing a photo of her. Filming locations included Los Angeles, Redondo Beach, South Africa, and Namibia. The gold mines and dumps around South Africa were used for the underground setpieces. The sets were inspired by &amp;ldquo;future noir&amp;rdquo; films like &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien from L.A.&lt;/em&gt; was released on February 26, 1988. It was released on VHS in June 1995 and on DVD in June 2005. Vinegar Syndrome has released a Blu-ray edition with special features. A direct-to-video sequel, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Center of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;, also directed by Albert Pyun and starring Kathy Ireland, was released in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Bob Briggs called it a &amp;ldquo;pretty decent film&amp;rdquo;, awarding it two stars. Rebecca Harris of the &lt;em&gt;Abilene Reporter-News&lt;/em&gt; gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4. David Picking called it &amp;ldquo;a cheapo adventure movie without a single redeeming quality&amp;rdquo;. Rob Thomas of &lt;em&gt;The Capital Times&lt;/em&gt; said &amp;ldquo;Completely awful – you can&amp;rsquo;t believe they&amp;rsquo;re serious.&amp;rdquo; Daniel M. Kimmel of the &lt;em&gt;Worcester Telegram &amp;amp; Gazette&lt;/em&gt; gave the film one out of five stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a description of the 1978 science fiction horror film &lt;em&gt;The Alien Factor&lt;/em&gt;, directed, written, and produced by Don Dohler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot centers around a spaceship crash in a sparsely populated area of Earth. Three grotesque aliens survive the crash and begin terrorizing the local residents. A character named Ben Zachary steps forward to fight back against the extraterrestrial threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cast&#34;&gt;Cast &lt;a href=&#34;#cast&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main cast includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don Leifert as Ben Zachary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Griffith as Sheriff Cinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Dyszel as Mayor Wicker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mary Mertens as Edie Martin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Geiwitz as Pete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Stover as Steven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleanor Herman as Mary Jane Carter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anne Frith as Dr. Ruth Sherman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Schlechter and John Cosentino played the aliens Inferbyce and Zagatile, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alien Factor&lt;/em&gt; marked Don Dohler&amp;rsquo;s directorial debut after he was laid off from his job as a payroll manager. The initial script was a comedy with 15 monsters, but it was changed to a straight horror film with only three monsters. Larry Schlechter and John Cosentino built the creature suits for the Inferbyce and Zagtile, respectively. Ernest D. Farino created the Leemoid through stop motion animation. Filming took place in and around Baltimore, Maryland, from October 1976 to April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release&#34;&gt;Release &lt;a href=&#34;#release&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was released on DVD by Retromedia Entertainment on February 26, 2002. Image Entertainment released it on November 15, 2005, as part of the Don Dohler Collection. Mill Creek Entertainment released it on July 19, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film received generally negative reviews. &lt;em&gt;TV Guide&lt;/em&gt; gave it two out of five stars, calling it &amp;ldquo;silly.&amp;rdquo; Dave Sindelar criticized the acting and direction. &lt;em&gt;Critical Outcast&lt;/em&gt; acknowledged the film&amp;rsquo;s flaws but admired Dohler&amp;rsquo;s initiative. &lt;em&gt;VideoHound&amp;rsquo;s Golden Movie Retriever&lt;/em&gt; awarded it one and a half out of four bones, noting the decent special effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sequels&#34;&gt;Sequels &lt;a href=&#34;#sequels&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alien Factor 2: Alien Rampage&lt;/em&gt; was not a direct sequel. Fred Olen Ray, the Retromedia distributor, used the sequel-sounding title for marketing purposes. The original title was &lt;em&gt;Alien Rampage&lt;/em&gt;, filmed in 1999 as Don Dohler&amp;rsquo;s comeback movie after an 11-year hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;center-for-ufo-studies-cufos&#34;&gt;Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) &lt;a href=&#34;#center-for-ufo-studies-cufos&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) is a privately funded UFO research group. It is a nonprofit organization founded in 1973 by J. Allen Hynek, who was the chair of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University in Illinois at the time. The organization&amp;rsquo;s headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois, United States. CUFOS&amp;rsquo;s website is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cufos.org&#34;&gt;www.cufos.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Allen Hynek, the founder of CUFOS, was a scientific consultant for Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force&amp;rsquo;s official study of the UFO phenomenon from 1948 to 1969. Initially a skeptic, Hynek gradually became convinced that some UFO cases were not hoaxes or misidentifications and might represent something extraordinary, such as alien visitation. After the Air Force shut down Project Blue Book in 1969, Hynek founded CUFOS in 1973 to continue collecting and studying UFO reports. James W. Moseley described CUFOS as the first real attempt to establish a private research group genuinely dedicated to the scientific investigation and study of UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;operation&#34;&gt;Operation &lt;a href=&#34;#operation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUFOS, which started in Evanston, Illinois, but is now based in Chicago, continues to be a small research organization emphasizing the scientific analysis of UFO cases. Its archives include files from defunct civilian research groups like the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). Following Hynek&amp;rsquo;s death in 1986, CUFOS was renamed the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in his honor. Mark Rodeghier, an associate editor of the Journal of Scientific Exploration, has been the Director of CUFOS since 1986. Ufologists who have served on the CUFOS Board of Directors include Jerome Clark, Michael D. Swords, and Thomas E. Bullard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUFOS maintains a library and archives of UFO-related materials, open for use by researchers and investigators. It also continues to compile and analyze reports of UFO incidents from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1969-incident-regarding-the-sighting-of-a-ufo&#34;&gt;1969 incident regarding the sighting of a UFO &lt;a href=&#34;#1969-incident-regarding-the-sighting-of-a-ufo&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the UFO sighting reported by Jimmy Carter in 1969, prior to his governorship and presidency. It covers the details of the sighting, the subsequent investigation, and its impact on Carter&amp;rsquo;s views on UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sighting&#34;&gt;Sighting &lt;a href=&#34;#sighting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the details of the UFO sighting as reported by Jimmy Carter. In 1969, while preparing to give a speech at a Lions Club meeting in Leary, Georgia, Carter and several other witnesses observed a bright, white object in the western sky. The object reportedly moved closer, stopped near a stand of pine trees, and changed colors before receding into the distance. Carter described the object as self-illuminated and not solid. The sighting lasted approximately 10-12 minutes and was witnessed by about 10-12 people. The section also includes quotes from Carter recounting the event in later interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;date&#34;&gt;Date &lt;a href=&#34;#date&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the conflicting information regarding the exact date of the sighting. While Carter initially reported the sighting occurred in October 1969, Lions Club records suggest it took place on January 6, 1969, the date of Carter&amp;rsquo;s speech to the Leary Lions Club. The section presents evidence supporting the January date, including Carter&amp;rsquo;s role as district governor of the Lions Club (a term that ended in June 1969) and the disbandment of the Leary Lions Club before October 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;object-and-investigation&#34;&gt;Object and investigation &lt;a href=&#34;#object-and-investigation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the investigation into the sighting and alternative explanations for the object. It mentions that many attendees of the Lions Club meeting did not recall the event or did not consider it significant. One guest, Fred Hart, remembered a &amp;ldquo;blue light&amp;rdquo; that he thought might have been a weather balloon. The section also notes that Carter, while considering the object a UFO (unidentified flying object), did not believe it was an alien spacecraft. Ufologist Robert Sheaffer proposed that the object was Venus, which was near its maximum brightness and in the correct location on January 6, 1969. Ufologist Allan Hendry agreed with the Venus assessment. The section also mentions a 2007 interview where Carter stated he was an amateur astronomer and knew what Venus looked like, suggesting it was not Venus. It also presents an explanation from Carl G. &amp;ldquo;Jere&amp;rdquo; Justus, who worked on Air Force projects involving the release of glowing chemical clouds. Justus suggests the sighting was a barium cloud released from Eglin AFB in Florida on January 6, 1969, at 7:35 pm EST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the impact of the sighting on Carter&amp;rsquo;s views on UFOs. During his 1976 presidential campaign, Carter pledged to make all UFO-related information available to the public if elected. However, after becoming president, he distanced himself from this pledge, citing &amp;ldquo;defense implications.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section lists various media reports from the 1970s covering Carter&amp;rsquo;s UFO sighting. It mentions articles in the &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Constitution&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Argosy UFO&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;UFO Investigator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. It also notes inaccuracies in some of these reports, such as incorrect dates and locations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ilkley Moor UFO incident</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_6b0a3cf135d2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_6b0a3cf135d2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ilkley-moor-ufo-incident&#34;&gt;Ilkley Moor UFO Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#ilkley-moor-ufo-incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the alleged UFO incident that occurred on Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire, England, on December 1, 1987. A retired police officer, using the pseudonym Philip Spencer, claimed to have been abducted by aliens during a morning walk. He purportedly took a photograph of one of the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilkley Moor, located between Ilkley and Keighley in West Yorkshire, England, is known for inspiring the song &amp;ldquo;On Ilkla Moor Baht &amp;lsquo;at&amp;rdquo; and for its carved rocks, including the Swastika Stone. The area has a history of UFO sightings, which some skeptics attribute to the proximity of Menwith Hill airforce base and Leeds Bradford Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Spencer, a retired police officer, had moved to West Yorkshire with his family. On the morning of the incident, he was walking across Ilkley Moor to visit his father-in-law, carrying a camera and compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident&#34;&gt;Incident &lt;a href=&#34;#incident&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer reported encountering a four-foot tall, dark green creature with an oversized head and long, thin arms. He claimed the creature gestured at him, but he took a photograph before it ran away. Spencer followed the creature but lost it in the fog. He then witnessed a whitish, two-part saucer-shaped craft rising from the moor and disappearing into the sky, accompanied by a loud hum. He did not photograph the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the encounter, Spencer found himself in a different town, two hours later than expected, and his compass was pointing in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-aftermath&#34;&gt;Initial Aftermath &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-aftermath&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer contacted UFO researchers Jenny Randles and Peter Hough, handing over the copyright of the photo to Hough. Hough initially skeptical, later came to believe Spencer&amp;rsquo;s account. Spencer remained anonymous and did not profit from the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hough had the photograph examined by experts. A wildlife photographer ruled out known animals, and Kodak experts found no evidence of tampering. US Navy optics expert and ufologist Bruce Maccabee deemed the photo too grainy for proper testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ufologist Nick Redfern claims that Spencer was harassed by the Ministry of Defence and visited by Men in Black who tried to intimidate him into silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;account-changed-under-hypnosis&#34;&gt;Account Changed Under Hypnosis &lt;a href=&#34;#account-changed-under-hypnosis&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer experienced strange dreams after the incident. On Hough&amp;rsquo;s advice, he underwent regressive hypnotherapy with Jim Singleton on March 16, 1988. Under hypnosis, Spencer&amp;rsquo;s account changed. Singleton considered it a &amp;ldquo;genuine recall.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer now recalled being paralyzed upon seeing the creature, lifted into the craft, and told to remain calm. Green aliens performed medical experiments on him, inserting items into his nose and mouth. He was given a tour of the craft and shown two films. The first film depicted apocalyptic imagery, including nuclear explosions, famines, and floods. He has never revealed the contents of the second film, claiming the aliens do not want humanity to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Spencer was returned to Ilkley Moor and took the photograph. He now claimed the alien was waving goodbye, not telling him to stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ilkley Moor incident became a major news story in the UK and remains a famous UFO sighting. Nick Pope, a former Ministry of Defence &amp;lsquo;UFO desk&amp;rsquo; journalist, included it in his &amp;ldquo;Top 10 UFO incidents in the UK&amp;rdquo; list in 2011. It is considered by some as one of the most persuasive UFO incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics dismiss the incident as a hoax. They argue the photograph is too blurry to prove alien visitation and that the &amp;ldquo;alien&amp;rdquo; could be a person or cardboard cutout. They also question why Spencer didn&amp;rsquo;t photograph the craft and point out that compasses can be easily damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_2e93b1dd3f75/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 13:24:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34;&gt;Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI) &lt;a href=&#34;#communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CETI is a branch of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) that focuses on composing and deciphering interstellar messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. A well-known CETI experiment is the 1974 Arecibo message composed by Frank Drake. The abbreviations CETI and SETI are generic and do not refer to any particular organization like the SETI Institute. CETI research focuses on mathematical languages, pictorial systems (like the Arecibo message), algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; language communication. Research also addresses how to overcome problems of decipherment in interplanetary communication, similar to the challenges posed by undeciphered writing systems in human communication like Linear A. In 2015, scientists including Douglas Vakoch, David Grinspoon, Seth Shostak, and David Brin discussed active SETI and the potential risks of transmitting messages to extraterrestrials. A statement signed by many in the SETI community emphasized the need for a global discussion before sending any messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, speculation about inhabitants of other planets was common, with many believing intelligent beings lived on the Moon, Mars, and/or Venus. Before radio, proposals for signaling extraterrestrials included Carl Friedrich Gauss&amp;rsquo;s 1820 suggestion to draw a giant Pythagorean triangle on the Siberian tundra and Joseph Johann Littrow&amp;rsquo;s 1819 idea to use the Sahara as a &amp;ldquo;blackboard&amp;rdquo; with trenches filled with water and kerosene to create signals. Astronomers like Franz von Paula Gruithuisen also looked for signs of life, claiming to see cities and agriculture on the Moon and evidence of life on Venus. By the late 1800s, Mars became the focus after Giovanni Schiaparelli reported &amp;ldquo;canali&amp;rdquo; (channels) on Mars, which were mistranslated as &amp;ldquo;canals,&amp;rdquo; sparking enthusiasm about Martian life. Inventor Charles Cros sought funding for a giant mirror to signal Martians, while Nikola Tesla believed his inventions could be used for interplanetary communication and claimed to have observed extraterrestrial radio signals. The Guzman Prize was created, offering 100,000 francs to the first person to establish interplanetary communication, excluding Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mathematical-and-scientific-languages&#34;&gt;Mathematical and Scientific Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#mathematical-and-scientific-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers artificial languages designed for interstellar communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lincos-lingua-cosmica&#34;&gt;Lincos (Lingua cosmica) &lt;a href=&#34;#lincos-lingua-cosmica&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans Freudenthal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse&lt;/em&gt; (1960) expands upon Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols. A dictionary resembling Lincos was featured in Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; and its film adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lancelot Hogben&amp;rsquo;s 1963 essay &amp;ldquo;Astraglossa&amp;rdquo; describes a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses, where short pulses represent numbers and trains of long pulses represent symbols for addition, subtraction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s 1985 science fiction novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; explores how a message might be constructed for communication with an alien civilization, using prime numbers as a starting point, followed by universal principles and facts of mathematics and science. Sagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject, and an updated collection of articles was published in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34;&gt;A Language Based on the Fundamental Facts of Science &lt;a href=&#34;#a-language-based-on-the-fundamental-facts-of-science&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle&amp;rsquo;s 1992 paper, &lt;em&gt;A language based on the fundamental facts of science&lt;/em&gt;, describes a language similar in syntax to Astraglossa and Lincos, but which builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34;&gt;Busch General-Purpose Binary Language Used in Lone Signal Transmissions &lt;a href=&#34;#busch-general-purpose-binary-language-used-in-lone-signal-transmissions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language later used in the Lone Signal project to transmit crowdsourced messages to extraterrestrial intelligence (METI). This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the Lone Signal hailing message. The Lone Signal project sent messages to Gliese 526 (HD 119850) in the constellation Boötes, with the message sent on July 10, 2013, and expected to arrive in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pictorial-messages&#34;&gt;Pictorial Messages &lt;a href=&#34;#pictorial-messages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictorial communication systems describe fundamental mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as bitmaps. These messages assume the recipient has similar visual capabilities and can understand basic mathematics and geometry. A critique is that they presume a shared understanding of shapes, which may not be the case with a species with substantially different vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pioneer-probes&#34;&gt;Pioneer Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#pioneer-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two etched plaques, known as the Pioneer plaques, were included aboard the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft when they launched in 1972 and 1973. The plaques depict the location of the Solar System within the galaxy and the Earth within the Solar System, as well as the form of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;voyager-probes&#34;&gt;Voyager Probes &lt;a href=&#34;#voyager-probes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977, the Voyager probes carried two golden records that were inscribed with diagrams similar to the Pioneer plaques, depicting the human form, the Solar System, and its location. Also included were recordings of images and sounds from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arecibo-message&#34;&gt;Arecibo Message &lt;a href=&#34;#arecibo-message&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arecibo message, transmitted in 1974, was a 1,679-pixel bitmap that, when properly arranged into 73 rows and 23 columns, shows the numbers one through ten; the atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus; the formulas for the sugars and bases that make up the nucleotides of DNA; the number of nucleotides in the human genome; the double helix structure of DNA; a simple illustration of a human being and its height; the human population of Earth; a diagram of the Solar System; and an illustration of the Arecibo telescope with its diameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Call&lt;/em&gt; messages consisted of digital sections – &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo;, a copy of the Arecibo Message, the Bilingual Image Glossary, and the Braastad message – as well as text, audio, video, and other image files submitted for transmission by people around the world. The &amp;ldquo;Rosetta Stone&amp;rdquo; was composed by Stéphane Dumas and Yvan Dutil, and represents a multi-page bitmap that builds a vocabulary of symbols representing numbers and mathematical operations. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from Evpatoria Planetary Radar in Russia under the scientific guidance of Alexander L. Zaitsev. Richard Braastad coordinated the overall project. Star systems to which the messages were sent include 16 Cyg A, 15 Sge, HD 178428, Gl 777, Hip 4872, HD 245409, 55 Cnc, HD 10307, and 47 UMa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Teen-Age Message&lt;/em&gt;, composed by Russian scientists (Zaitsev, Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the 70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center in Ukraine to six star systems resembling that of the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consists of three parts: a coherent-sounding radio signal with slow Doppler wavelength tuning, analog information representing musical melodies performed on the theremin, and Arecibo-like binary digital information. Star systems to which the message was sent are HD 197076, 47 UMa, 37 Gem, HD 126053, HD 76151, and HD 193664.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cosmic Call-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program &lt;em&gt;Ella&lt;/em&gt;, and the Braastad message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic communication systems describe a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a virtual machine. Advantages include localized communication, forward error correction, and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34;&gt;Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI) &lt;a href=&#34;#communication-with-extraterrestrial-intelligence-ceti&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CETI is a branch of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) that focuses on composing and deciphering interstellar messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. A well-known CETI experiment is the 1974 Arecibo message composed by Frank Drake. The abbreviations CETI and SETI are generic and do not refer to any particular organization like the SETI Institute. CETI research focuses on mathematical languages, pictorial systems (like the Arecibo message), algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; language communication. The challenges of deciphering undeciphered writing systems in human communication, such as Linear A, are relevant to the problems of interplanetary communication. In 2015, scientists discussed active SETI and the potential risks of transmitting messages to extraterrestrials, leading to a statement advocating for a global discussion before any messages are sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, speculation about inhabitants of other planets was common, with many believing in intelligent beings on the Moon, Mars, and Venus. Before radio, proposals for signaling extraterrestrials included Carl Friedrich Gauss&amp;rsquo;s idea of drawing a giant Pythagorean triangle on the Siberian tundra and Joseph Johann Littrow&amp;rsquo;s suggestion to use the Sahara as a &amp;ldquo;blackboard&amp;rdquo; with trenches filled with kerosene for burning signals. Astronomers like Franz von Paula Gruithuisen looked for signs of life on the Moon and Venus, though his claims were later refuted. Interest shifted to Mars after Giovanni Schiaparelli&amp;rsquo;s discovery of &amp;ldquo;canali&amp;rdquo; (mistranslated as &amp;ldquo;canals&amp;rdquo;), sparking enthusiasm about Martian life, which eventually proved illusory. Inventor Charles Cros sought funding for a giant mirror to signal Martians, while Nikola Tesla believed his inventions could be used for interplanetary communication, claiming to have observed extraterrestrial radio signals. The Guzman Prize was established to reward the first person to establish interplanetary communication, excluding Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hans Freudenthal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse&lt;/em&gt; (1960) expands on Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols. The Carl Sagan novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; and its film adaptation featured a dictionary resembling Lincos.&lt;/p&gt;

John Elliott is a key researcher in this area. A key concept is that human languages conform to a Zipfian distribution, which may also apply to alien languages. Laurance Doyle explains that the slope of a line that represents individual tokens in a stream of tokens may indicate whether the stream contains linguistic or other structured content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article explores the alleged core similarities in claims of alien abduction experiences. Proponents believe these similarities point to an objective reality, while skeptics attribute them to psychological and cultural factors. Skeptics also suggest that some reports are hoaxes. Believers argue that the independent generation of similar narratives by individuals is unlikely. Some investigators attempt to confirm abduction claims through observation or experimentation, but these efforts are often dismissed as pseudoscientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the typical sequence of events in an alien abduction narrative, according to UFO researchers like folklorist Thomas E. Bullard. The sequence includes capture, examination, conference, tour, loss of time, return, theophany, and aftermath. It notes that not all abductions feature all events and that some researchers, like Budd Hopkins and David M. Jacobs, have been accused of selectively using data to fit a specific paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nymans-alternate-outline&#34;&gt;Nyman&amp;rsquo;s Alternate Outline &lt;a href=&#34;#nymans-alternate-outline&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents an alternative model for abduction narratives composed by abduction researcher Joe Nyman. The model includes anxious anticipation, transition of consciousness, psycho-physical imposition, reassurance, transition back to normal consciousness, rapid forgetfulness, a marker stage, and a cycle interval. David M. Jacobs is quoted, emphasizing the orchestrated nature of abduction events. The section also mentions the connection between alien abductions and UFO reports, as well as the common portrayal of abductors as &amp;ldquo;Greys.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;capture&#34;&gt;Capture &lt;a href=&#34;#capture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the events leading up to the alleged abduction. It describes unusual feelings, such as a compulsive desire to be in a certain place or expectations of something unknown. Abductees report a shift in consciousness, often accompanied by lights and a strange mist. They may be levitated into an alien craft, sometimes through solid objects. The section also mentions scenarios involving automobiles, UFO sightings, mechanical failures, and amnesia. The use of a pencil-sized device by the aliens to ensure compliance is also noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examination&#34;&gt;Examination &lt;a href=&#34;#examination&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the medical procedures and examinations performed by alien beings during the abduction. It highlights the differences between these procedures and typical human medicine, as noted by physician and abduction researcher John G. Miller. The section discusses the abductors&amp;rsquo; areas of interest, such as the cranium, nervous system, skin, and reproductive system, as well as the lack of gloves and other standard medical practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cranial-procedures&#34;&gt;Cranial Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#cranial-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the specific procedures allegedly performed on the abductee&amp;rsquo;s head. Yvonne Smith, a hypnotherapist and abduction researcher, notes similarities in reports of hypnotically retrieved abduction memories. Common procedures include feelings of pressure, insertion of needles into the scalp, drilling into the skull, and procedures involving the ears and nasal passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reproductive-gynecological-and-urological-procedures&#34;&gt;Reproductive, Gynecological and Urological Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#reproductive-gynecological-and-urological-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the gynecological aspects of the abduction experience reported by many female abductees. It notes the absence of standard gynecological practices. Reports of sex with human-alien hybrids or other abductees are mentioned. The insertion of a long needle-like contraption into a woman&amp;rsquo;s navel is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-procedures&#34;&gt;Other Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#other-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section covers other procedures reported by abductees, such as skin scrapings. Physician and abduction researcher John Altshuler dismisses speculation that the aliens are collecting skin samples to analyze DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reported-devices-and-instruments&#34;&gt;Reported Devices and Instruments &lt;a href=&#34;#reported-devices-and-instruments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the devices and instruments allegedly used by the aliens during the abduction. It mentions a black, cylindrical device with a bluish light used to render abductees compliant. The placement of devices on the chest and the use of diffused colored lights are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subsequent-abduction-procedures&#34;&gt;Subsequent Abduction Procedures &lt;a href=&#34;#subsequent-abduction-procedures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details procedures that occur after the medical exam, including imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing. Imaging involves viewing screens with emotionally provocative images. Envisioning involves images projected into the abductee&amp;rsquo;s mind. Staging involves the abductee interacting with an illusionary scenario. Testing involves operating a complicated electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;child-presentation&#34;&gt;Child Presentation &lt;a href=&#34;#child-presentation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the &amp;ldquo;child presentation&amp;rdquo; phase, where abductees are shown hybrid children. It is speculated that these children are the products of reproductive procedures. Folklorist Thomas Bullard could not identify this phase in his study of abduction reports. The section discusses the varying ages of the hybrid children, their roles in assisting the abductors, and the expectations placed on the abductees during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;less-common-elements&#34;&gt;Less Common Elements &lt;a href=&#34;#less-common-elements&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses less prominent aspects of abduction claims, based on a study by folklorist Thomas E. Bullard. These elements include the conference, the tour, the journey, and theophany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conference&#34;&gt;Conference &lt;a href=&#34;#conference&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the conference phase, where the entities engage in discussions with the abductee. The discussions may involve interrogation sessions, explanatory segments, task assignments, warnings, and prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tour&#34;&gt;Tour &lt;a href=&#34;#tour&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the rare occurrence of tours of the abductors&amp;rsquo; craft. Abduction claimants often find the &amp;ldquo;engine room&amp;rdquo; to be the most memorable aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;journey&#34;&gt;Journey &lt;a href=&#34;#journey&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes reports of further transport within the abductors&amp;rsquo; vessel, sometimes to other planets. The abductee may be placed in a protective environment, such as a chamber filled with liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;theophany&#34;&gt;Theophany &lt;a href=&#34;#theophany&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the rare experience of &amp;ldquo;theophany,&amp;rdquo; a sense of oneness with the universe or with God. Psychologist Susan A. Clancy notes that abductees often feel &amp;ldquo;changed&amp;rdquo; by their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;return&#34;&gt;Return &lt;a href=&#34;#return&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section describes the return of the abductees to Earth, usually to the same location and circumstances they were in prior to being taken. Explicit memories of the abduction experience are usually absent, and the abductee may realize they have experienced &amp;ldquo;missing time.&amp;rdquo; The section also mentions instances where the abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-time&#34;&gt;Missing Time &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-time&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the phenomenon of &amp;ldquo;missing time&amp;rdquo; in abduction accounts. Don C. Donderi notes that there is often independent confirmation of missing time, as well as confirmation of abduction events reported under hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;realization-event&#34;&gt;Realization Event &lt;a href=&#34;#realization-event&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the &amp;ldquo;realization event,&amp;rdquo; the insight or development leading a person to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon. Physician and abduction researcher John G. Miller identifies common triggers for the realization event, such as tangible evidence, conversations with other abductees, exposure to depictions of the abduction phenomenon in popular culture, and hypnotic retrieval of abduction memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skeptical-response&#34;&gt;Skeptical Response &lt;a href=&#34;#skeptical-response&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section presents the skeptical perspective on the abduction phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;role-of-hypnosis-and-investigators-in-shaping-the-narrative&#34;&gt;Role of Hypnosis and Investigators in Shaping the Narrative &lt;a href=&#34;#role-of-hypnosis-and-investigators-in-shaping-the-narrative&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses how individual abduction researchers appear to exert influence on the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall. Skeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass argue that this influence reinforces the preconceived biases of the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effect-of-geography-and-culture-on-abduction-reports&#34;&gt;Effect of Geography and Culture on Abduction Reports &lt;a href=&#34;#effect-of-geography-and-culture-on-abduction-reports&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the variation in abduction reports across cultures and geographic boundaries. Skeptics assert that this variation supports a psycho-social hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of the abduction phenomenon. The section also notes that the contents and structure of the &amp;ldquo;abduction narrative&amp;rdquo; were already established in fictional form by 1930 in a Buck Rogers strip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UFO religion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_0a1958d0044c/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 04:35:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ufo-religion&#34;&gt;UFO Religion &lt;a href=&#34;#ufo-religion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UFO religion is a religion where belief in extraterrestrial entities operating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) is a core element. Adherents typically believe these ETs are interested in humanity&amp;rsquo;s welfare and that humanity will eventually join an existing ET civilization. Some UFO religions incorporate ETs into a supernatural worldview, blurring the lines between aliens and angels. These religions draw inspiration from early science fiction, ufology, UFO sightings, and alien abduction stories. The Aetherius Society, founded by George King, is considered the first UFO religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adherents believe that the arrival or rediscovery of alien civilizations, technologies, and spirituality will enable humans to overcome ecological, spiritual, and social problems. Issues like hatred, war, bigotry, and poverty are believed to be resolvable through superior alien technology and spiritual abilities. These belief systems are often millenarian in their outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO religions developed in countries like the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan, where technology is advanced enough to conceive of ETs and where religion is not suppressed. The term &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo; and the popular notion of the UFO originated in 1947. The study of UFO religions by sociologists, historians, theologians, scholars of religious studies, and new religious movements began in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-ufo-religions&#34;&gt;Notable UFO Religions &lt;a href=&#34;#notable-ufo-religions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO religions generally involve belief in communication with extraterrestrial beings through physical contact, telepathy, and astral projection. These groups often believe that humanity will be saved by aliens who will educate humans on a better way to live or take believers to a more positive location. Extraterrestrial beings are often seen pleading with humanity to improve itself and move away from greed and violence. UFO religions emphasize spiritual growth and the evolution of humanity. A UFO religion can form before or after an individual claims to have experienced an alien abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Gordon Melton identifies the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; Activity, founded by Guy Ballard, as the first UFO religion, although Christopher Hugh Partridge views it as a theosophical religion. Partridge notes that UFO religions believe the supreme being or &amp;ldquo;evolved entity&amp;rdquo; came from another plane or planet. The 1947 Roswell incident is a key point in time within UFO spirituality. James R. Lewis notes that Ufologists see it as the date of the &amp;ldquo;emergence of UFOs into the public consciousness.&amp;rdquo; Partridge places UFO religion within the context of theosophical esotericism and asserts that it began to be associated as &amp;ldquo;UFO religion&amp;rdquo; after the Roswell incident. He notes that most UFO religions still have many of the key points associated with Theosophy, such as belief in the same Spiritual Hierarchy, and he also draws parallels to New Age thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hunt describes the Aetherius Society, founded by George King in 1955, as &amp;ldquo;probably the first and certainly the most enduring UFO cult.&amp;rdquo; Hunt places the Aetherius Society and Raëlism among the &amp;ldquo;most renowned&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;flying saucer cults.&amp;rdquo; Melodie Campbell and Stephen A. Kent place the Aetherius Society and Unarius as among the &amp;ldquo;oldest and most studied&amp;rdquo; of the flying saucer cults. They describe Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Gate and Order of the Solar Temple as the &amp;ldquo;most controversial groups combining UFO belief with variations of contactee assertions.&amp;rdquo; Gregory L. Reece classes Scientology as a &amp;ldquo;UFO group,&amp;rdquo; discussing elements of the Xenu cosmogony and Space opera in Scientology doctrine. He compares Scientology to the Aetherius Society and Ashtar Command. Victoria Nelson writes that &amp;ldquo;[t]he most prominent current UFO religion is probably the science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s Church of Scientology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alien Planet (2005 TV series)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_e77076cc2caf/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-planet-2005-tv-series&#34;&gt;Alien Planet (2005 TV series) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-planet-2005-tv-series&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2005 docufiction TV special created for the Discovery Channel, based on Wayne Barlowe&amp;rsquo;s 1990 book &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;. It explores the imagined extraterrestrial life of the fictional planet Darwin IV in the style of a nature documentary. It features scientists and science fiction figures discussing Darwin IV as if it had actually been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Von Braun&lt;/em&gt; interstellar spacecraft travels to Darwin IV, 6.5 light-years away. It deploys the &lt;em&gt;Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/em&gt; to find landing sites for probes. The first probe, &lt;em&gt;Balboa&lt;/em&gt;, explodes during entry. Backup probes &lt;em&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/em&gt; (Leo) and &lt;em&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/em&gt; (Ike) land successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic probes, called Horus Probes, are equipped with inflatable balloons, solar receptors, computers, sensors, and smaller robots. They have limited AI and are programmed with different personalities. Ike is cautious, while Leo is a risk-taker. They are equipped with a holographic message for any sentient life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probes encounter various lifeforms, including Arrowtongues, Gyrosprinters, Trunk Suckers, Daggerwrists, and Unths. Ike studies plant life, while Leo goes after big game. A massive storm hits, and Ike launches weather balloons. Leo finds Bladderhorns and attempts to present the holographic message, but is interrupted. Ike encounters Grovebacks, Littoralopes, Skewers, Beach Quills, and Prongheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leo briefly re-establishes contact with &lt;em&gt;Von Braun&lt;/em&gt; until a mysterious creature interferes. Ike is ordered to search for Leo. Ike finds a sea that is Amoebic in nature and encounters giant Sea Striders. Ike finds Leo&amp;rsquo;s last known location, where a Skewer is killed by a spear. Ike finds Leo and the sapient Eosapiens. Ike presents the holographic message to the Eosapiens, but one of them destroys the camera disk, and the Eosapiens attack Ike. The wrecked camera disk records the Eosapiens carrying Ike away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary from Michio Kaku, Stephen Hawking, Jack Horner, James B. Garvin, and George Lucas is interspersed throughout the special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production&#34;&gt;Production &lt;a href=&#34;#production&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Planet&lt;/em&gt; is based on &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt; (1990) by Wayne Barlowe. Barlowe served as one of the executive producers. Scientists and other figures were assembled to comment on the life on Darwin IV. The documentary gives the appearance of the featured scientists having designed Darwin IV and its animals, most of what is shown of the actual planet and its life follows what is described in &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;Expedition&lt;/em&gt;, which is set in the mid-24th century, &lt;em&gt;Alien Planet&lt;/em&gt; is set in the near future, and the planet is explored using sophisticated probes. The technology featured is more advanced than present-day technology, but is based on current trends and informed speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwayne A. Day of &lt;em&gt;The Space Review&lt;/em&gt; gave the special a positive review. Some criticism was leveled at the strangeness of the creatures showcased. Day stated that the animals are bizarre and frequently border on the implausible. A review in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; stated that a few too many of the creatures seem like cartoonish monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;natural-history-of-an-alien&#34;&gt;Natural History of an Alien &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-history-of-an-alien&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a description of the 1998 British pseudo-documentary TV program &lt;em&gt;Natural History of an Alien&lt;/em&gt;, also known as &lt;em&gt;Anatomy of an Alien&lt;/em&gt; in the US.

      <title>First Contact (novelette)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_09c859882d14/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 10:06:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_09c859882d14/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-contact&#34;&gt;First Contact &lt;a href=&#34;#first-contact&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; is a science fiction novelette written by Murray Leinster, published in &lt;em&gt;Astounding Science Fiction&lt;/em&gt; in May 1945. It received a retro Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1996. The story is notable for its early depiction of a universal translator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot &lt;a href=&#34;#plot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story revolves around the crew of the exploration ship &lt;em&gt;Llanvabon&lt;/em&gt; encountering an alien vessel near the Crab Nebula. Both ships are technologically matched and represent their respective civilizations. The central conflict arises from the mutual fear that either ship could trace the other back to their home planet, leading to potential exploitation or destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication is established, revealing that the aliens are humanoid bipeds who perceive infrared light and communicate via microwaves. Despite the differences, the crews, particularly a young human named Tommy Dort and his alien counterpart &amp;ldquo;Buck,&amp;rdquo; develop a rapport. However, the underlying tension remains due to the strategic implications of revealing their home worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story reaches a climax when Tommy proposes a solution: a mutual exchange of crews and ships. Each crew would take the other&amp;rsquo;s ship back to their respective home planets after disabling all tracking equipment. This plan is complicated by the realization that the aliens have independently conceived the same strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story concludes with the successful exchange, each crew departing in the other&amp;rsquo;s ship. They remove any identifying information that could lead back to their home worlds. Both sides anticipate technological gains from the exchange and plan to meet again in the future.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; was adapted into radio plays for &lt;em&gt;Dimension X&lt;/em&gt; on September 8, 1951, and for &lt;em&gt;X Minus One&lt;/em&gt; on October 6, 1955. The &lt;em&gt;X Minus One&lt;/em&gt; version was a condensed adaptation with an altered ending. The story was also performed on &lt;em&gt;Exploring Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; on January 15, 1958.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing style of &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; is considered representative of the Golden Age of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Murray Leinster&amp;rsquo;s estate filed a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures, alleging trademark infringement related to the film &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/em&gt;. The estate claimed ownership of the term &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; and argued that Paramount&amp;rsquo;s use of the phrase infringed on their trademark. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled in favor of Paramount, granting summary judgment and dismissing the suit. The court determined that the term &amp;ldquo;First Contact&amp;rdquo; had become generic, describing a common science fiction trope, and lacked the necessary secondary meaning to be protected as a trademark.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dover Demon</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_670cdf070164/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dover-demon&#34;&gt;Dover Demon &lt;a href=&#34;#dover-demon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dover Demon is a creature reportedly sighted in Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sightings&#34;&gt;Sightings &lt;a href=&#34;#sightings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section details the reported sightings of the Dover Demon in April 1977. William &amp;ldquo;Bill&amp;rdquo; Bartlett, John Baxter, and Abby Brabham, all teenagers at the time, independently reported seeing a strange creature. Bartlett described it as about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth, with a watermelon-shaped head. Baxter reported a similar sighting on Miller Hill Road, and Brabham claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue. The teenagers drew sketches of the creature, with Bartlett swearing on a stack of Bibles to the accuracy of his drawing. The locations of the sightings, when plotted on a map, formed a straight line over 2 miles. The sightings became public in May, and a local investigator noted similarities to the creatures in the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter. The Mutual UFO Network also investigated the sightings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-explanations&#34;&gt;Possible explanations &lt;a href=&#34;#possible-explanations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section explores potential explanations for the Dover Demon sightings. One suggestion is that the creature was a foal or a moose calf. Skeptic Joe Nickell proposes that the creature was likely a snowy owl, citing its size and plumage, which could reflect yellow headlights. The &amp;ldquo;long spindly arms&amp;rdquo; could be the partially opened wings of the owl. Police suggested the sightings were a school vacation hoax. Ben Radford suggests the sightings may have been influenced by the release of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture &lt;a href=&#34;#in-popular-culture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines the Dover Demon&amp;rsquo;s appearances in popular culture. It was featured in an episode of the American horror television series &lt;em&gt;Lost Tapes&lt;/em&gt; on Animal Planet in 2009. The Dover Demon appears as a character in the comic book series &lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;, where it can see into the future, and in &lt;em&gt;The Perhapanauts&lt;/em&gt;. It also made appearances in &lt;em&gt;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&lt;/em&gt;. A Dover Demon appears in the webcomic &lt;em&gt;Gunnerkrigg Court&lt;/em&gt;. In the manga series &lt;em&gt;Dandadan&lt;/em&gt;, an alien known as Dover Demon takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jafr alien invasion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_d7bf74b1dd15/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2024 10:36:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;2010-jordanian-newspaper-prank-the-jafr-alien-invasion&#34;&gt;2010 Jordanian Newspaper Prank: The Jafr Alien Invasion &lt;a href=&#34;#2010-jordanian-newspaper-prank-the-jafr-alien-invasion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article details the events surrounding a prank published by the Jordanian newspaper &lt;em&gt;Al-Ghad&lt;/em&gt; on April 1, 2010. The prank involved a fabricated story about UFOs landing near the town of Jafr, Jordan, and the panic that ensued among the town&amp;rsquo;s residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article on the front page of &lt;em&gt;Al-Ghad&lt;/em&gt; claimed that UFOs had landed in the desert near Jafr, and the &amp;ldquo;pilots&amp;rdquo; were described as 3-meter-tall creatures. The story also stated that communications were disrupted by the UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;details-of-the-prank-and-reaction&#34;&gt;Details of the Prank and Reaction &lt;a href=&#34;#details-of-the-prank-and-reaction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story elaborated on the alien landing, describing how the town was illuminated by the flying saucers at night, causing residents to flee into the streets. The hoax caused widespread fear in Jafr, leading parents to keep their children home from school. The mayor of Jafr, Mohammed Mleihan, contacted security authorities and considered ordering an evacuation of the town&amp;rsquo;s 13,000 residents. He also expressed the residents&amp;rsquo; fear of an alien attack and considered suing the newspaper for spreading false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apology-and-context&#34;&gt;Apology and Context &lt;a href=&#34;#apology-and-context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper issued a formal apology for the disruption caused by the prank. The editor did not explain why Jafr was chosen as the target of the joke. However, the BBC noted that the area is known for its military bases, which have been used by American soldiers for joint exercises with the Jordanian military and had allegedly housed al-Qaida militants in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-and-cultural-context&#34;&gt;Comparison and Cultural Context &lt;a href=&#34;#comparison-and-cultural-context&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prank is compared to the 1938 radio broadcast of &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, which caused panic in the United States. The article emphasizes that April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day jokes are not a common practice in Jordanian newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article cites two sources: a BBC article titled &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Alien invasion&amp;rsquo; April Fools&amp;rsquo; story angers Jordan mayor&amp;rdquo; and a &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; article titled &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Alien invasion&amp;rsquo; April Fools prank causes public panic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;external-links&#34;&gt;External Links &lt;a href=&#34;#external-links&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nash-Fortenberry UFO sighting occurred on July 14, 1952, when two commercial pilots, William B. Nash and William H. Fortenberry, reported seeing eight UFOs in a tight echelon formation over Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two commercial pilots, William B. Nash and William H. Fortenberry, reported observing eight UFOs flying in formation over Chesapeake Bay, Virginia. Ufologists highlight the pilots&amp;rsquo; observation allowed for measurements of the objects&amp;rsquo; motion and size relative to known landmarks. The sighting was reportedly corroborated by independent ground witnesses. Project Blue Book listed the case as an &amp;ldquo;unknown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Howard Menzel suggested the pilots might have seen distorted ground lights due to haze or fireflies trapped in the cockpit window. Steuart Campbell proposed the sighting was a mirage of Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section details a significant event that occurred around 8:15 pm in Batulechaur, Pokhara. Residents reported witnessing a &amp;ldquo;blazing object&amp;rdquo; accompanied by a loud thunderous sound, which appeared to disintegrate over the Kaski region.

Additional fragments of a similar object were found in Talakot and Turepasal. The CIA documented this event. Kevin D. Randle mentions in his book &amp;ldquo;Moon Dust&amp;rdquo; that the American embassy in Kathmandu sent a secret message to the 1127th USAF Field Activities Group and the 1006th at Fort Belvoir, requesting full cooperation from the Nepalese government, under the subject &amp;ldquo;MOON DUST&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aliens-exist&#34;&gt;Aliens Exist &lt;a href=&#34;#aliens-exist&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aliens Exist&amp;rdquo; is a song by the American rock band Blink-182, featured on their 1999 album &lt;em&gt;Enema of the State&lt;/em&gt;. The song, primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge with additional credit to bassist Mark Hoppus, is a lighthearted take on the existence of extraterrestrial life. It references UFO phenomena, including alleged CIA involvement and the Majestic 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blink-182, originating from suburban San Diego, gained prominence in the late 1990s with their pop-punk sound. The band members included guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Travis Barker. DeLonge&amp;rsquo;s fascination with extraterrestrials began in middle school and continued as he toured, reading books about paranormal activity. Barker recalls DeLonge constantly searching for UFOs. DeLonge used his first personal computer to research alien phenomena. He amassed a collection of UFO books and military interviews about UFO experiences. Hoppus found DeLonge&amp;rsquo;s beliefs amusing. DeLonge and Hoppus often debated the song&amp;rsquo;s subject matter, leaving each other messages on their equipment. Barker, then a touring musician, arranged the song&amp;rsquo;s tempo and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;composition&#34;&gt;Composition &lt;a href=&#34;#composition&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song is written in common time with a tempo of 216 beats per minute, in the key of B major. The lyrics, written by DeLonge, express youthful curiosity about the universe and attempt to convince listeners of the legitimacy of his claims. The lyrics suggest the CIA is suppressing information and reference the Majestic 12, a supposed group of scientists studying alien spacecraft in the 1940s. DeLonge explained the song&amp;rsquo;s perspective as that of someone who believes in aliens but is dismissed by others, directing his frustration towards the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-and-reception&#34;&gt;Release and Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#release-and-reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aliens Exist&amp;rdquo; was initially previewed as part of an online medley and officially released on &lt;em&gt;Enema of the State&lt;/em&gt; in June 1999. It received positive reviews, with some critics praising its departure from typical pop-punk themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-performances&#34;&gt;Live Performances &lt;a href=&#34;#live-performances&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not released as a single, the band performed the song on &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&lt;/em&gt; in 2000. It was a regular part of their tour and live album, &lt;em&gt;The Mark, Tom and Travis Show&lt;/em&gt;. The band retired the song in 2002 but revived it on their 2019 tour, with Matt Skiba filling in for DeLonge. DeLonge also performed the song with Angels &amp;amp; Airwaves in 2019. Following DeLonge&amp;rsquo;s return to Blink-182, the band continued to perform the song on their 2023 world tour, incorporating tabloid imagery of DeLonge&amp;rsquo;s interest in aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy&#34;&gt;Legacy &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song has been re-examined in light of DeLonge&amp;rsquo;s continued pursuit of UFO research. It is remembered as a standout track from &lt;em&gt;Enema of the State&lt;/em&gt; and is considered part of American pop culture&amp;rsquo;s fascination with aliens. Blink-182 embraced this image, using alien imagery on merchandise and at concerts. DeLonge continued to explore alien themes in his band Angels &amp;amp; Airwaves. Machine Gun Kelly&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Concert for Aliens&amp;rdquo; was seen as reminiscent of DeLonge&amp;rsquo;s earlier work. DeLonge co-founded To the Stars, a company focused on aerospace, science, and entertainment, with former government and intelligence officials. In 2017, the company released leaked military footage of unidentified aerial phenomena, later confirmed by the Pentagon, which legitimized DeLonge&amp;rsquo;s research. This led to the Pentagon formally establishing interest in studying UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pascagoula-abduction&#34;&gt;Pascagoula Abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#pascagoula-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pascagoula Abduction refers to an alleged UFO sighting and alien abduction that occurred in 1973. Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed to have been abducted and examined by extraterrestrial beings while fishing near the Pascagoula River in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alleged-abduction&#34;&gt;Alleged abduction &lt;a href=&#34;#alleged-abduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of October 11, 1973, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker reported to the Jackson County, Mississippi, sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office that they experienced an unusual event while fishing on a pier along the Pascagoula River. They described hearing a strange whirring sound and seeing flashing blue lights, followed by the appearance of an oval-shaped object. Hickson and Parker claimed they were paralyzed and then taken aboard the object by three creatures with robotic features and crab-like pincers, where they underwent an examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publicity-and-later-activities&#34;&gt;Publicity and later activities &lt;a href=&#34;#publicity-and-later-activities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, Charles Hickson engaged in interviews, lectures, and television appearances, including an episode of &lt;em&gt;To Tell The Truth&lt;/em&gt;. He also claimed additional encounters with aliens and authored a book titled &lt;em&gt;UFO Contact at Pascagoula&lt;/em&gt;. Calvin Parker attended UFO conventions and started a company called &amp;ldquo;UFO Investigations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Hickson died in September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Calvin Parker released his own book, &lt;em&gt;Pascagoula: The Closest Encounter, My Story&lt;/em&gt;, providing his full account of the event and its impact on his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, a historical marker was unveiled at the site of the alleged abduction. Calvin Parker, along with Hickson&amp;rsquo;s son and family, attended the unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin Parker died in August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skepticism&#34;&gt;Skepticism &lt;a href=&#34;#skepticism&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aviation journalist and UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass found discrepancies in Hickson&amp;rsquo;s story and noted his refusal to take a polygraph exam. Klass concluded that the case was a hoax. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell questioned Hickson&amp;rsquo;s behavior and suggested that the alien encounter may have been a hypnagogic &amp;ldquo;waking dream state.&amp;rdquo; Nickell also suggested that Parker&amp;rsquo;s corroboration was due to suggestibility, as he initially claimed to have passed out during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien implants are physical objects that some people believe are placed in their bodies after being abducted by aliens. These implants are purported to have various capabilities, including telepresence, mind control, and biotelemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of alien implants can be traced back to a 1957 radio show interview with ufologist John Robinson, who recounted a neighbor&amp;rsquo;s claim of being kidnapped by aliens and controlled by &amp;ldquo;small earphones.&amp;rdquo; Betty Andreasson claimed aliens implanted a device in her nose in 1967. Dorothy Wallis made a similar claim in 1983. Authors like Whitley Strieber popularized the idea of alien abductions and associated implants. John E. Mack examined an object given to him by a client who claimed it came out of her nose after an abduction. Roger Leir claimed to have removed alien implants from patients. Skeptic Joe Nickell suggests that supposed alien implants are ordinary materials that become lodged in the body and surrounded by scar tissue. Virgil Priscu stated that there is &amp;ldquo;No mystery, no implants&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien implants, depicted as small needles inserted into victims, first appeared in the 1953 film &lt;em&gt;Invaders from Mars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_839526ac14a4/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 16:07:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_839526ac14a4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;caesar&#34;&gt;CAESAR &lt;a href=&#34;#caesar&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAESAR (Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return) was a proposed sample-return mission to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. It was a finalist in NASA&amp;rsquo;s New Frontiers program mission 4 but was not selected. If chosen, it would have launched in 2024-2025 and returned a sample to Earth in 2038.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mission-overview&#34;&gt;Mission Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission aimed to collect a sample from comet 67P, which was previously explored by the European Space Agency&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; probe and its lander &lt;em&gt;Philae&lt;/em&gt;. The existing data from &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; would have allowed for a more informed spacecraft design, increasing the chances of mission success. NASA ultimately selected the &lt;em&gt;Dragonfly&lt;/em&gt; mission over &lt;em&gt;CAESAR&lt;/em&gt; in June 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comet sample-return mission was a prioritized goal in the 2003 and 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey. Prior comet missions by NASA include &lt;em&gt;Deep Space 1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stardust&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CONTOUR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/em&gt;, along with participation in the &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; mission. &lt;em&gt;Comet Hopper&lt;/em&gt; was another mission proposal that was a Discovery Program finalist but was not selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;astrobiology&#34;&gt;Astrobiology &lt;a href=&#34;#astrobiology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAESAR&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s objectives centered on understanding the formation of the Solar System and the origins of life. The mission aimed to investigate the possibility that comets delivered organic compounds, specifically tholins, to early Earth, potentially seeding the planet with the building blocks of life. The &lt;em&gt;Rosetta&lt;/em&gt; mission detected tholins on comet 67P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacecraft&#34;&gt;Spacecraft &lt;a href=&#34;#spacecraft&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems would have built the spacecraft, utilizing technology from the &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; mission. Malin Space Science Systems would have provided the camera suite for navigation, sample site selection, and documentation. Honeybee Robotics would have provided the robotic arm (TAG) and the Sample Acquisition System. The Japanese space agency JAXA would have provided the sample return capsule and heatshield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;propulsion&#34;&gt;Propulsion &lt;a href=&#34;#propulsion&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft&amp;rsquo;s propulsion system would have been NASA&amp;rsquo;s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT), a type of solar electric propulsion. The system would have used three NEXT thrusters, with one as a spare, and xenon as the propellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sample-return&#34;&gt;Sample Return &lt;a href=&#34;#sample-return&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft would have used a &amp;ldquo;Touch-And-Go&amp;rdquo; (TAG) robotic arm to collect regolith from the comet&amp;rsquo;s surface, similar to &lt;em&gt;OSIRIS-REx&lt;/em&gt;. A burst of nitrogen gas would have blown regolith particles into the sampler head. &lt;em&gt;CAESAR&lt;/em&gt; would have collected between 80 and 800 grams of regolith. The system had enough compressed nitrogen gas for three sampling attempts. The sample would have been returned to Earth in a capsule provided by JAXA, landing at the Utah Test and Training Range in 2038. The sample would then be transported to NASA&amp;rsquo;s Johnson Space Center for curation and analysis at the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate (ARES). A portion of the sample would also be curated at Japan&amp;rsquo;s Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;joe-alien&#34;&gt;Joe Alien &lt;a href=&#34;#joe-alien&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Alien is a British comic book character who appeared in strips published by Fleetway Publications. He debuted in the preview issue of the science fiction anthology &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; in October 1988. The character&amp;rsquo;s strip was one of four linked serials in &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; and was later briefly featured in &lt;em&gt;Eagle&lt;/em&gt; after &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; was canceled. Joe Alien is the last survivor of the planet Xgangbe-4 and joins the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; mission to help humanity find a new home, commanding the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat 2&lt;/em&gt; exploration shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;Creation &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrie Tomlinson created Joe Alien as part of a new science fiction anthology, &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt;, for Fleetway Publications. The concept involved linking all five features in the comic to form an overall narrative centered on the spaceship &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt;. Tomlinson created four lead characters, including Joe Alien, to head exploration teams. Massimo Belardinelli was the initial artist for &amp;ldquo;Joe Alien,&amp;rdquo; with Tomlinson praising his ability to bring the story to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publishing-history&#34;&gt;Publishing history &lt;a href=&#34;#publishing-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; began publication in October 1988, featuring &amp;ldquo;Joe Alien&amp;rdquo; as the color strip. Ron Smith took over as the artist from the third issue. &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; was canceled after 12 issues and merged with &lt;em&gt;Eagle&lt;/em&gt; in March 1989. &amp;ldquo;Joe Alien&amp;rdquo; continued in &lt;em&gt;Eagle&lt;/em&gt; for four weeks in May 1989 to complete the story arc and also featured in three episodes of &amp;ldquo;The Wildcat Complete&amp;rdquo; anthology. Rebellion Developments purchased the rights to &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; in 2016 and announced plans to reprint the contents in collected editions. As of 2025, only &amp;ldquo;Turbo Jones&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Loner&amp;rdquo; have been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-summary&#34;&gt;Plot summary &lt;a href=&#34;#plot-summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Alien joins the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; mission after Turbo Jones realizes Earth is doomed. Joe, the last survivor of Xgangbe-4, possesses vast knowledge stored in an external brain-pack. He is selected for his intelligence and physical attributes. After the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt; launches, Joe&amp;rsquo;s sensors locate a potential new home for the refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He leads the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat Two&lt;/em&gt; shuttle to scout Area 17, where his team encounters carnivorous vegetation and a two-headed alien. They discover that the plants are controlled by a mad human astronaut from a 2079 Mars mission, who is now worshipped as a god. Joe brokers an alliance with giant insects to escape and later participates in other expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe shares the story of the Xgangbe&amp;rsquo;s destruction by the Kargroz and his revenge. He is later chosen to find an alien shapeshifter on board the &lt;em&gt;Wildcat&lt;/em&gt;. Joe, along with Jones, Loner, and Magee, is kidnapped by a Gamemaster of the Glarzon race but is released after defeating the Glarzon&amp;rsquo;s troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry details the book &amp;ldquo;A Verdade Sufocada&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;The Suffocated Truth&amp;rdquo;) written by Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a Brazilian military colonel convicted of torture during Brazil&amp;rsquo;s military dictatorship (1964-1985). The book presents Ustra&amp;rsquo;s perspective on the left-wing armed resistance during that period and his experiences as head of DOI-CODI, an agency known for political repression, torture, and murder of the dictatorship&amp;rsquo;s opponents. The book&amp;rsquo;s publication faced boycotts, requiring the author&amp;rsquo;s family to finance its print runs. It gained attention after being quoted by Jair Bolsonaro during Dilma Rousseff&amp;rsquo;s impeachment vote in 2016 and became a bestseller. However, it has been heavily criticized by historians and sociologists who question its reliability as a historical document.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extraterrestrial sample curation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_97f8be919529/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 06:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_97f8be919529/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;extraterrestrial-sample-curation&#34;&gt;Extraterrestrial Sample Curation &lt;a href=&#34;#extraterrestrial-sample-curation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the specialized facilities and procedures required for handling and preserving samples returned from space, with a focus on planetary protection and sample integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section emphasizes the importance of bringing extraterrestrial materials to Earth for in-depth scientific analysis due to the limitations of spacecraft instruments. It highlights the need for specialized biocontainment facilities that also function as cleanrooms to prevent contamination of the samples and protect Earth from potential biohazards. The section differentiates between non-restricted samples (e.g., from the Moon, asteroids) and restricted samples (from potentially habitable bodies like Mars), which require more stringent containment measures. It mentions the Biosafety Levels (BSL) required for each type of sample, with restricted samples needing BSL-4 facilities. A key challenge is the need to both contain the samples and allow researchers to analyze them without compromising their integrity or Earth&amp;rsquo;s safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;non-restricted-materials&#34;&gt;Non-restricted Materials &lt;a href=&#34;#non-restricted-materials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the curation of samples from celestial bodies not considered to pose a biohazard risk, such as the Moon, asteroids, and comets. It mentions that as of 2019, only JAXA (Japan) and NASA (United States) operate BSL-3 laboratories dedicated to curating these samples. The Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center at JAXA is highlighted for its ability to handle samples without atmospheric exposure. The Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry at the Russian Academy of Sciences is mentioned as the location where Luna Soviet mission samples are studied and stored. The &lt;em&gt;OSIRIS-REx&lt;/em&gt; mission&amp;rsquo;s sample return to Earth is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;restricted-materials&#34;&gt;Restricted Materials &lt;a href=&#34;#restricted-materials&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section addresses the handling of samples from planets or moons suspected of harboring past or present life, which are classified as Category V bodies. It emphasizes that these samples require BSL-4 facilities, but existing BSL-4 labs are not adequate for both sample preservation and Earth protection. Two proposed facilities are discussed: the European Sample Curation Facility (ESCF) in Vienna and NASA&amp;rsquo;s Mars Sample-Return Receiving Facility (MSRRF). The MSRRF had multiple designs submitted in 2009, and its construction is estimated to take 7-10 years, with an additional 2 years for staff training. A mobile BSL-4 facility for preliminary biohazard analysis at the landing site is also being considered. The section outlines stringent containment requirements, including filtering particles as small as 0.01 μm to prevent the release of potential biohazards, including gene transfer agents (GTAs) and ultramicrobacteria. The section also notes that some advocate for robotic systems within BSL-4 facilities to minimize human contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;william-l-moore-ufologist&#34;&gt;William L. Moore (Ufologist) &lt;a href=&#34;#william-l-moore-ufologist&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Leonard Moore, born October 31, 1943, is an author and former UFO researcher who gained prominence from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. He is best known for co-authoring two books with Charles Berlitz, including &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;career&#34;&gt;Career &lt;a href=&#34;#career&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore&amp;rsquo;s interest in UFOs began in his teenage years. He graduated from Thiel College in Greenville, Pennsylvania, in 1965. After teaching language and humanities at various high schools, he became the Arizona state section director of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). He then transitioned to a career as a freelance writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He co-authored &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt; with Charles Berlitz in 1979, which explored the alleged naval military experiment aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Eldridge&lt;/em&gt; in 1943. In 1980, Moore and Berlitz co-wrote &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt;, which claimed that the Roswell UFO incident involved the crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 1987, Moore, along with ufologists Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman, circulated the Majestic 12 documents, which purported the existence of a high-level policy-making group overseeing UFOs and extraterrestrials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a 1989 MUFON conference, Moore admitted to engaging in &amp;ldquo;disinformation&amp;rdquo; activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility&lt;/em&gt; has been largely dismissed as an unsubstantiated urban myth. &lt;em&gt;The Roswell Incident&lt;/em&gt; has been criticized as a collection of hearsay and unwarranted speculation. Critics have also pointed fingers at Moore regarding the fraudulent nature of the Majestic 12 documents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;max-evans-roswell&#34;&gt;Max Evans (Roswell) &lt;a href=&#34;#max-evans-roswell&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell &amp;ldquo;Max&amp;rdquo; Evans is a fictional character created by Melinda Metz for the &lt;em&gt;Roswell High&lt;/em&gt; book series and adapted for the &lt;em&gt;Roswell&lt;/em&gt; television series (1999-2002). He is portrayed by Jason Behr in the original series and by Nathan Parsons in the CW reboot. Max is a central character throughout the series, first appearing in the pilot episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fictional-character-summary&#34;&gt;Fictional character summary &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-character-summary&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the TV character, distinguishing it from the &lt;em&gt;Roswell High&lt;/em&gt; book version. Max&amp;rsquo;s backstory reveals that in a previous life, he was Zan, the king of Antar. After Zan&amp;rsquo;s death, his DNA and human DNA were used to create alien/human hybrids or clones, including Isabel Evans (Vilandra, Zan&amp;rsquo;s sister), Michael Guerin (Rath, Vilandra&amp;rsquo;s betrothed), and Tess Harding (Ava, Zan&amp;rsquo;s bride). These clones were sent to Earth to escape their enemies, particularly Kivar. The craft carrying Max, Isabel, Michael, and Tess crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. Army initially took the alien pods, but they were rescued and hidden. The clones emerged in 1989, appearing as children. Max and Isabel were adopted by the Evans, while Michael ended up in foster care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics &lt;a href=&#34;#characteristics&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max is presented as shy and introverted, a facade necessitated by his hybrid nature. He is a complex character, displaying both timidity and passion. Despite his initial shyness, he emerges as the leader among his friends. He is portrayed as a deep thinker, often spurred to action by his protective instincts. He takes responsibility for his actions and is known for his unique healing powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;powers-and-abilities&#34;&gt;Powers and abilities &lt;a href=&#34;#powers-and-abilities&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max possesses molecular manipulation and telekinesis, abilities shared by the other hybrids. His unique power is healing through physical contact, famously used to save Liz Parker in the pilot episode. He also develops the ability to generate a force field. It is suggested that his healing ability can trigger the development of alien powers in those he heals, such as Liz Parker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relationship-with-liz-parker&#34;&gt;Relationship with Liz Parker &lt;a href=&#34;#relationship-with-liz-parker&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max&amp;rsquo;s love for Liz Parker is a central theme. He has been in love with her since childhood but keeps his distance due to his alien identity. He reveals his secret to save her life after she is shot, initiating the main plot of the show. Their connection is portrayed as deep and mysterious, with Liz able to sense when Max is in danger. Their relationship is considered a core aspect of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recurring-themes&#34;&gt;Recurring themes &lt;a href=&#34;#recurring-themes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Max and Liz is presented as a modern example of forbidden love, with references to &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;. Maria De Luca refers to them as &amp;ldquo;modern Romeo and Juliet against the world.&amp;rdquo; The concept of soulmates is also a recurring theme, emphasizing their deep connection and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fictional-biography&#34;&gt;Fictional biography &lt;a href=&#34;#fictional-biography&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max is first seen watching Liz at the Crashdown Café. After Liz is accidentally shot, Max heals her, revealing his alien nature. Liz discovers his secret and becomes his confidante. Max and Liz&amp;rsquo;s relationship develops, complicated by his secret. Liz breaks up with Kyle Valenti to be with Max. The hybrids search for answers about their origins. Max discovers a fourth alien. Tess Harding arrives, revealed to be another hybrid. Nasedo kidnaps Liz, prompting Max to save her. Max is abducted by the FBI but rescued by Nasedo and Michael. Sheriff Valenti pledges to protect Max, Isabel, and Michael. The ship reveals their past as the Royal Four of Antar, with Tess and Max being married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;season-two&#34;&gt;Season two &lt;a href=&#34;#season-two&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max struggles with his role as &amp;ldquo;reluctant king.&amp;rdquo; His relationship with Liz is strained. He learns about new powers and responsibilities. The &amp;ldquo;skins&amp;rdquo; arrive in Roswell. Max tries to rekindle his relationship with Liz, but she rejects him. A future version of Max warns that their love will cause the end of the world. Max and Tess become friends. Alex dies. Max has a personal crisis and loses his balance. Tess helps him remember his past. Max sleeps with Tess, who becomes pregnant. Max takes responsibility and stays with Tess. Tess mindwarps him into believing the baby is sick. Max and his friends plan to return to Antar. Liz, Maria, and Kyle discover that Tess killed Alex. Max confronts Tess and lets her go to Antar to save the baby. He reunites with Liz and declares his love for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;season-three&#34;&gt;Season three &lt;a href=&#34;#season-three&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max searches for his son. He and Liz rob a convenience store to find the ship. Liz&amp;rsquo;s parents forbid her from seeing Max. Max discovers Cal Langley, an alien protector. Langley tries to interfere with Max&amp;rsquo;s search. Max forces Langley to help him find the ship. The ship doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Max realizes he almost lost everything, especially Liz. Max encounters Samuel, an autistic child. Max realizes that Liz is his family. Liz develops alien powers. Liz decides to take a break from Roswell. Someone kills Michael&amp;rsquo;s friend, Monk. Michael discovers that Meta-Chem is tracking him. Max, Michael, and Isabel rescue Valenti. Max sacrifices his life to heal Meris&amp;rsquo; husband. Max&amp;rsquo;s soul is inside Clayton. Clayton assumes Max&amp;rsquo;s body. Clayton tries to kill Liz. Max takes control and tells Liz to kill him. Liz kills Clayton, and Max is resurrected. Michael becomes the king. Max returns to be the king. Tess returns with Max&amp;rsquo;s son, Zan. Tess sacrifices herself. Max gives Zan up for adoption. Liz receives visions of the future. The group agrees to flee Roswell.

      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 02:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_679d3f288d30/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;darwin&#34;&gt;Darwin &lt;a href=&#34;#darwin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin was a proposed ESA Cornerstone mission involving a constellation of spacecraft designed to detect Earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars and search for evidence of life. The most recent design featured three free-flying space telescopes redirecting light to a fourth spacecraft containing beam combiners, spectrometers, and cameras. An earlier design included six 1.5-meter telescopes, a beam combiner, and a separate power and communications spacecraft. The study of this mission ended in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;: Detection of Earth-like planets and search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operator&lt;/strong&gt;: ESA (European Space Agency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Sun-Earth L2 Lagrangian point in a Halo orbit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events&lt;/strong&gt;: Study ended in 2007 with no further activities planned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept&#34;&gt;Concept &lt;a href=&#34;#concept&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space telescopes were designed to observe in the infrared spectrum. This region was chosen because the difference in brightness between an Earth-like planet and its star is less pronounced in the infrared compared to the visible spectrum. The spacecraft components in the optical path would need to be passively cooled to 40 kelvins for infrared observations. The planet search would have used a nulling interferometer configuration to cancel out light from the central star, allowing for the detection of orbiting planets. If a suitable planet was detected, a detailed study of its atmosphere would be conducted by analyzing its infrared spectrum for evidence of life, such as the presence of oxygen and water vapor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;: Infrared observation, nulling interferometer, atmospheric analysis for biosignatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important People&lt;/strong&gt;: Mention of a 2000 ESA bulletin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events&lt;/strong&gt;: Design considerations for infrared observations and planet detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;candidate-planets&#34;&gt;Candidate planets &lt;a href=&#34;#candidate-planets&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planet Gliese 581 d, discovered in 2007, was considered a good candidate for the Darwin project because it orbits within the habitable zone of its star, potentially supporting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;: Gliese 581 d as a potential target for observation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Events&lt;/strong&gt;: Discovery of Gliese 581 d in 2007.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA&amp;rsquo;s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission was similar in concept to Darwin. However, the TPF project was deferred indefinitely in 2006 and later cancelled in 2011. Antoine Labeyrie proposed a larger space-based astronomical interferometer called the Hypertelescope, which would be more expensive and complex than Darwin and TPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://localhost:1313/content/content_91cb3c28f781/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 00:37:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/content/content_91cb3c28f781/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;northern-light&#34;&gt;Northern Light &lt;a href=&#34;#northern-light&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Light was a proposed Canadian Mars lander and rover mission. It was a concept mission studied by a consortium of Canadian universities, companies, and organizations, with Thoth Technology Inc. as the primary contractor. The mission was ultimately cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mission-overview&#34;&gt;Mission Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#mission-overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission aimed to send a lander and rover to Mars. The spacecraft would have consisted of an apogee kick engine, a cruise vehicle, the Northern Light lander, and the Beaver Rover. A Hohmann transfer orbit would have been used for the journey to Mars. Atmospheric entry would have been achieved using a heat shield, parachute, and airbag system. The lander would have deployed the rover onto the Martian surface and communicated directly with Earth via the Algonquin Radio Observatory&amp;rsquo;s 46 m parabolic antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;beaver-rover&#34;&gt;Beaver Rover &lt;a href=&#34;#beaver-rover&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beaver Rover was designed to have a maximum range of 1000 meters from the landing site. It would have been battery-powered and equipped with tools and sensors to investigate surface rocks for evidence of photosynthetic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History &lt;a href=&#34;#history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project officially began in 2001, led by Ben Quine of York University. York University has a history of participation in the Canadian Space Program and has designed space research instruments used by NASA, including the meteorological station on the Phoenix Mars lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involved partnerships with several Canadian universities, including York University, University of Alberta, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, University of Winnipeg, University of Western Ontario, University of Saskatchewan, University of New Brunswick, McGill University, and Simon Fraser University. Mission control after landing was planned to be headquartered at York University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated cost was $20 million, potentially less with international collaboration. The Canadian Space Agency was aware of the project but not involved. In 2014, a crowdfunding campaign was launched on Indiegogo and YouTube to raise $1.1 million CAD for flight hardware development, but it only raised $10,012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;scientific-goals&#34;&gt;Scientific Goals &lt;a href=&#34;#scientific-goals&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission had four primary scientific goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for life on Mars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for water on Mars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate the Martian electromagnetic radiation environment and atmospheric properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare for international Mars sample return and human missions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;payload-of-the-beaver-rover&#34;&gt;Payload of the Beaver Rover &lt;a href=&#34;#payload-of-the-beaver-rover&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beaver Rover was designed for geological surface exploration and subsurface imaging. Weighing approximately 6 kg, it would have operated independently with a range of about 1 km. It would have carried a visible camera for navigation and surface exploration, a point spectrometer, and a microscope camera for geological surveys. A ground-penetrating radar would have explored the Martian subsurface for water, and an active vibrator and receiver would have conducted an acoustic study of the subsurface. A rock grinding tool was included for immediate subsurface exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;massur-seismic-sensor&#34;&gt;MASSur Seismic Sensor &lt;a href=&#34;#massur-seismic-sensor&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MASSur Seismic Sensor, developed by the University of Calgary, would have provided depth profiles of the Martian surface. A seismometer would have tested the rigidity and elasticity of the Martian topsoil and its rock properties. The seismic system would have used a vibrational source and accelerometers on both the lander and the rover. The redundancy of sensors on both platforms ensured that some primary science objectives could be met even without rover deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ground-penetrating-radar&#34;&gt;Ground Penetrating Radar &lt;a href=&#34;#ground-penetrating-radar&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) would have used a 200 MHz radar to provide fine-scale subsurface imaging to a depth of 20 m in loose aggregate and up to 100 m in permafrost or ice. The design shared systems with the seismic instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tc-corer&#34;&gt;TC Corer &lt;a href=&#34;#tc-corer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corer would have been capable of drilling up to 10 mm into surface rocks. It would have been used with the Aurora spectrometer and microscope to examine the near-surface composition and search for biosignatures. The core was a contribution from Hong Kong. The flight model instrument had an estimated mass of 350 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;payload-of-the-northern-light-lander&#34;&gt;Payload of the Northern Light Lander &lt;a href=&#34;#payload-of-the-northern-light-lander&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aurora-spectrometer&#34;&gt;Aurora Spectrometer &lt;a href=&#34;#aurora-spectrometer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed spectrometer would have had a wavelength coverage of 625 nm to 2500 nm and observed the whole sky. It would have measured variations in spectral irradiance to determine aerosol and atmospheric composition, including carbon dioxide concentration. It would also have measured the angular dependency of radiation influx in the atmosphere. The Aurora instrument had a mass of 450 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;argus-spectrometer&#34;&gt;Argus Spectrometer &lt;a href=&#34;#argus-spectrometer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar in design to the Argus 1000 spectrometer flown on CanX-2, the radiometer would have been the primary equipment of the Northern Light lander, making measurements of spectral rock reflectance. The spectrometer had a mass of 240 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera-systems&#34;&gt;Camera Systems &lt;a href=&#34;#camera-systems&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera systems on the lander would have had narrow and wide field survey capabilities. The narrow field survey would have provided a high-resolution, panoramic view of the landing site. Color filters would have performed spectral mapping and mineral identification of the surrounding soil. The camera would also have performed limited atmospheric and astronomical observations. Color images of Earth would have been obtained. The wide field survey would have provided an overall color view of the lander&amp;rsquo;s surroundings to help rover deployment and route planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;massur-seismic-sensors&#34;&gt;MASSur Seismic Sensors &lt;a href=&#34;#massur-seismic-sensors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar specifications as those on the Beaver Rover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environmental-sensors&#34;&gt;Environmental Sensors &lt;a href=&#34;#environmental-sensors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental sensors would have monitored conditions at the landing site. Instruments would have measured UV rays, oxidizing substances, air pressure, air temperature, dust impact, wind velocity, and ground vibration. These sensors would have a combined mass of 130 g. Flight models were previously developed for Britain&amp;rsquo;s Beagle 2 lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tracking&#34;&gt;Tracking &lt;a href=&#34;#tracking&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry system would have been tracked and targeted using a combination of Doppler radar and very long baseline interferometry. This data would have been processed by a high-resolution orbital model using high-precision ephemeris to predict spacecraft location and trajectory. Tracking would have commenced at the Algonquin Radio Observatory upon launch. Continuous tracking would have commenced as the package reached the Martian thermosphere to verify mechanism deployment during descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;landing-site&#34;&gt;Landing Site &lt;a href=&#34;#landing-site&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landing site would have been determined from one of three options by a crowd sourcing campaign. One option was a dry &amp;lsquo;sea&amp;rsquo;, within 5 km of a basin formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;alien-sculpture&#34;&gt;Alien (sculpture) &lt;a href=&#34;#alien-sculpture&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entry focuses on the 2012 sculpture &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; by British artist David Breuer-Weil. It details the sculpture&amp;rsquo;s physical characteristics, its installation history, the artist&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, and its reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description &lt;a href=&#34;#description&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sculpture &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; is a large-scale artwork created in 2012 by David Breuer-Weil. It depicts a giant humanoid figure, five times the size of a person, seemingly embedded head-first into the ground. The sculpture is made of glass reinforced plastic with a bronze powder coat. Key features include enlarged fingerprints and graffiti by the artist, and the name &amp;ldquo;Ernst&amp;rdquo; written on its surface. Its dimensions are 600 cm (240 in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation-history&#34;&gt;Installation History &lt;a href=&#34;#installation-history&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; was initially installed in Grosvenor Gardens in the City of Westminster in April 2013 as part of the City of Sculpture initiative. It remained there until April 13, 2015, after an extension to its initial six-month display period was approved. On September 7, 2015, the sculpture was moved to Mottisfont, a National Trust property in Hampshire, England, where it is currently located. The coordinates for its location at Mottisfont are provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inspiration-and-meaning&#34;&gt;Inspiration and Meaning &lt;a href=&#34;#inspiration-and-meaning&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Breuer-Weil drew inspiration for &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; from several sources. A significant influence was his grandfather, Ernst, who fled to England from Austria after the Nazi takeover in 1938 but was subsequently labeled an &amp;ldquo;enemy alien.&amp;rdquo; The name &amp;ldquo;Ernst&amp;rdquo; on the sculpture acknowledges this connection. The sculpture also incorporates a portrait of the fictional Kaiser of Nerac, a character from Breuer-Weil&amp;rsquo;s imaginary world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breuer-Weil intended &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; to evoke the surprise and shock of an alien landing. He also suggests that the sculpture explores themes of belonging and the human condition, with the &amp;ldquo;alien&amp;rdquo; representing something sudden and unexpected, like a new work of art. He connects the concept of being an alien to the Jewish experience, suggesting a sense of both belonging and being an outsider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception &lt;a href=&#34;#reception&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; was well-received by both the public and critics. It was named one of &lt;em&gt;Time Out&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Top 10 Public Sculptures&amp;rdquo; in July 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
